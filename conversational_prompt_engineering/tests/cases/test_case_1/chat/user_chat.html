<p><b>USER: </b>Selected data {}</p>
<p><b>ASSISTANT: </b>What would you like to do with these texts? Would you like to summarize them, extract specific information, or something else? {}</p>
<p><b>USER: </b>summarize {}</p>
<p><b>ASSISTANT: </b>I see that the texts are reviews of a restaurant. Would you like the summaries to focus on the overall sentiment, the food, the service, or something else? {}</p>
<p><b>USER: </b>I would like to find one good thing and one bad thing (if exists) {}</p>
<p><b>ASSISTANT: </b>So, you'd like the summaries to highlight one positive aspect and one negative aspect (if mentioned) of the restaurant in each review. Is that correct? If so, I'll suggest a prompt for the model. {}</p>
<p><b>USER: </b>yes {}</p>
<p><b>ASSISTANT: </b>Here's a suggested prompt for the model: **Extract one positive and one negative point (if mentioned) from each restaurant review.** Does this look good to you? {}</p>
