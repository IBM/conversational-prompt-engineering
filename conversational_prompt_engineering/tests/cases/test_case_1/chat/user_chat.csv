assistant,"What would you like to do with these texts? Would you like to summarize them, extract specific information, or something else?"
user,summarize
assistant,"I see that the texts are reviews of a restaurant. Would you like the summaries to focus on the overall sentiment, the food, the service, or something else?"
user,I would like to find one good thing and one bad thing (if exists)
assistant,"So, you'd like the summaries to highlight one positive aspect and one negative aspect (if mentioned) of the restaurant in each review. Is that correct? If so, I'll suggest a prompt for the model."
user,yes
assistant,Here's a suggested prompt for the model: **Extract one positive and one negative point (if mentioned) from each restaurant review.** Does this look good to you?
