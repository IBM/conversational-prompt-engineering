We had their lovely peppery house red, their signature Caesar salad (with a very tasty mustard/cream dressing) with steak and chips to follow. They are very generous with their portions, and they even give you seconds - the absolute best part of the meal. They also boast a delicious secret sauce. I went on a Tuesday night at 7pm and had to queue for about half an hour, however the queue moved fairly quickly (and I was under a heater!) and it was only a testament to the quality and popularity of this lovely place.""We arrived at about 2.00pm on a Saturday and pleased there wasn't a queue. As we were a big party (8) it took about 15 minutes to get table. Worth noting they were letting couples of two in front of us so don't be put off by a queue if you are just a couple. Choice of steak is well done, medium or rare - this is true to France rare means rare. Good atmosphere but very noisy and not suitable for a chat along a table for 8. We had 1 bottle of house red (very drinkable), six beers (small bottles) plus bottled water and we had just the steak course which includes a salad and bread and bill came to £66.00 per couple which is quite pricey. Would I go back? Yes but not for a while.""Probably my favourite steak place in London (excluding Hawksmoor). There is no choice at this restaurant, you simply order medium or rare for your steak (medium is very much a medium rare!) You are then given an awesome mustard dressed salad before the melt in your mouth steak, with fries and their special sauce which is a buttery herby infused sauce which is amazing! Recommend the house red which is lovely and only around £22. Never actually eaten pudding there but they do look good! There are a few of these in london and I have been to 3 of their locations in Paris as well and the Marylebone lane site is as close to the Parisian version as you can get. The food at all of them however is amazing!!""Visited the restaurant on a business trip to London based on the recommendation of a co-worker. I was a little leery being a vegetarian, and the restaurant being famous for its steak sauce. It was a Tuesday evening, and we had to wait fairly long to get seated. Even though the menu is limited, I was very impressed by the service, and the food. The salad and fries were the best I have had. And, the vegetarian main course, which was a mix of cheeses, was good as well. Our group had the chocolate ice cream for dessert, and it was also very tasty. The meat eaters in our group raved about the steak sauce! So, try one of their locations if you are in a city which has one.""Noticed people lining up every night to get into this quaint restaurant. So why not - we thought, we will give it a try. I had done my research on TripAdvisor so knew it was a fixed menu and was looking forward to a traditional Venetian experience with amazing steak. And to be fair it did compare to the rushed, crowded, average quality tourist traps that do abound in Venice, Italy. I've eaten steak all over the world and the best way to describe this was good. Not great, not bad. It didn't melt in the mouth. The flavor was nothing astounding. It was just good. So we enjoyed the experience and had a pleasant evening - but there are a lot of other restaurants to visit in Marylebone (and London) that excite the senses and that is where we will be going next."
