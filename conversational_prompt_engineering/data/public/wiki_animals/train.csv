0,"Opisthotropis hungtai, also known as Hung-Ta Chang's mountain keelback, is a species of snake in the family Colubridae. It is a slender, cylindrical snake with a total length of , snoutÐvent length of , and tail length of . The upper side of the head is glossy dark with scattered yellow flecking, the chin shields are yellow with brownish-black mottling at the margins, and eyes are black. The body and tail are glossy dark brown with a single yellow spot on each scale, the ventral scales are yellow with brownish-black margins and flecking, and the subcaudal scales yellow with brownish-black margins. Hung-Ta Chang's mountain keelback can be distinguished from other species in its genus by a combination of its measurements, scalation, and coloration.
The species is endemic to mountainous regions in China, where it has been collected from western Guangdong and southeastern Guangxi. It inhabits rocky streams surrounded by dense deciduous forest. It is threatened by the illegal wildlife trade and requires further study to better understand its population size and distribution.
Taxonomy.
""Opisthotropis hungtai"" was formally described by the Chinese herpetologist Jian Wang and his colleagues in 2020 based on an adult male specimen collected from the Heishiding Nature Reserve in Guangdong, China, in September 2014. Before Hung-Ta Chang's mountain keelback's description, specimens of the species were misidentified as being ""O. maculosa"". The specific epithet ""huntai"" is named after the Chinese botanist Hung-ta Chang, who founded the Tropical and Subtropical Forest Ecosystem Experimental Center in Heishiding Nature Reserve and helped advance ecological research in southern China. The authors of the study describing ""O. huntai"" recommended the English common name 'Hung-Ta Chang's mountain keelback' and the Chinese common name ().
Hung-Ta Chang's mountain keelback is one of over 20 species in the mountain keelback genus ""Opisthotropis"" in the family Colubridae. The 2020 study describing the species studied its relationship with 16 other species in its genus and found it to be most closely related to ""O. haihaensis""; these two species were most closely related to a clade formed by ""O. voquyi"" and ""O. jacobi"".
Description.
Hung-Ta Chang's mountain keelback is a slender, cylindrical snake with a total length of in females and in males. The snoutÐvent length varies from in males and in females, while the tail length is in males and in females. The holotype male specimen had glossy dark brown scales with scattered yellow flecking on the upperside of the head, yellow chin shields with brownish black mottling at the margins, and black eyes. The body and tail are glossy dark brown with a single yellow spot on each scale, the spots getting larger towards the sides of the body. The ventral scales are yellow with brownish black lateral margins and a few scattered brown flecks, while the subcaudal scales yellow with brownish black margins towards the front and sides. The scales on the body and tail are generally smooth, but are keeled on the underside of the tail. Other specimens of the species were very similar-looking to the holotype, but has more maxillary teeth, ventral scales, and subcaudal scales, and a relatively longer tail.
When preserved in 70% ethanol, the upper side of the head and body surface are dark brown and the underside is yellowish-beige. The dorsal scales have a light yellow blotch in the center, which become wider towards the side of the body. The tail scales on the under side also have light central blotches, while the underside of the head has indistinct light mottling, more obvious on temporal scales. The supralabial scales have a light blotch, the infralabial scales, chin shields, and smaller throat scales in front of the ventral scales are light yellow with brown mottling or blotches. The belly has some scattered dark flecks and the outermost edges of light ventral scales are brown. The subcaudal scales turn light yellow with black towards the front and sides.
Hung-Ta Chang's mountain keelback can be distinguished from other species in its genus by a combination of its measurements, scalation, and coloration. The tail is moderately long, with a tail length to total length ratio of 0.20Ð0.26 in males and 0.19Ð0.22 in females. The internasal scales does not touch the loreal scale and the prefrontal scale does not touch the supraocular scale, while the frontal scale touches the preocular scale. There is one preocular scale and one or two postocular scales, 1+1 temporal scales, and seven supralabial scales, of which the fourth and fifth touch the eye. There are 16Ð18 maxillary teeth. The chin shields are yellow with brownish black mottling and the frontal pair is longer than or equal to the posterior pair. There are 170Ð189 rows of ventral scales in males and 168Ð175 in females, while both sexes have 2 rows of preventral scales. There are 76Ð98 rows of subcaudal scales in males and 69Ð84 in females. The nasal cleft points to the second supralabial scale. The body scales are smooth and the tail scales are smooth or indistinctly keeled (having a ridge down the centre). In overall coloration, the body and underside of the tail are dark, with a light spot on each scale.
The species looks similar to and could be confused with ""O. haihaensis"" and ""O. maculosa"". It differs from ""O. haihaensis"" in having seven supralabials, the second last of which is significantly enlarged, narrow, long, and significantly wider than it is high, and 16Ð18 maxillary teeth. It can be told apart from ""O. maculosa"" by its prefrontal scale not touching the supraocular scales, the frontal scale touching preocular scales, the fourth and fifth supralabials touching the eye, the frontal pair of chin shields being longer than or equal to posterior pair, a larger number of subcaudals in males, and by chin shields having brownish black mottling instead of being unmarked.
Distribution and ecology.
Hung-Ta Chang's mountain keelback is endemic to mountainous regions in China, where it has been collected from Heishiding Nature Reserve and Dawuling Forestry Station western Guangdong and Mount Wuhuang in southeastern Guangxi. Like other mountain keelbacks, Hung-Ta Chang's mountain keelback inhabits rocky streams; specimens have been collected in pelitic streams and gutterways next to dirt paths in Guangdong and in streams in Guangxi. The habitat near these spots consisted of dense deciduous forest. Many species of mountain keelback, including Hung-Ta Chang's mountain keelback, are threatened by the illegal wildlife trade due to their attractive coloration. Additionally, surveys in southern China are needed to better understand the species' population size and distribution."
1,"Megalocnidae is an extinct family (alternatively considered to be a superfamily as Megalocnoidea) of sloths, native to the islands of the Greater Antilles from the Early Oligocene to the Mid-Holocene. They are known from Cuba, Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, but are absent from Jamaica. While they were formerly placed in the Megalonychidae alongside two-toed sloths and ground sloths like ""Megalonyx"", recent mitochondrial DNA and collagen sequencing studies place them as the earliest diverging group basal to all other sloths. or as an outgroup to Megatherioidea. They displayed significant diversity in body size and lifestyle, with ""Megalocnus"" being terrestrial and probably weighing several hundred kilograms, while ""Neocnus"" was likely arboreal and similar in weight to extant tree sloths, at less than 10 kilograms.
Origin.
It is thought that sloths arrived in the Caribbean from South America (where they arose) around the Eocene-Oligocene boundary about 33 million years ago, when there was a significant sea level drop caused by a glaciation episode. This has been associated with the GAARlandia (Greater Aves Antilles Ridge) hypothesis, where the Aves Ridge is suggested to have formed a land bridge during the interval, allowing overland migration into the Greater Antilles. The existence of such a land bridge has been questioned because of the lack of geological evidence for the Aves Ridge having been subaerially exposed as well as the fact that many other South American animals (such as marsupials and ungulates) are absent from the Greater Antilles, making a complete land bridge unlikely. The earliest evidence suggesting the presence of sloths in the Caribbean is a partial femur from the Early Oligocene of Puerto Rico. Other pre-Pleistocene fossil remains include ""Imagocnus"" from the Early Miocene of Cuba, and an indeterminate species from the Late Miocene of the Dominican Republic.
Description.
Megalocnid sloths were relatively small compared to mainland ground sloths, though they were the largest mammals native to the Caribbean islands with the largest species ""Megalocnus rodens"" estimated to weigh around or , with the smallest genera ""Neocnus"" and ""Acratocnus"" estimated to only weigh . 
Ecology.
Like other sloths megalocnids were probably folivores, with some authors suggesting that based on the anatomy of their limbs, that ""Neocnus"" and ""Acratocnus"" were likely climbing animals.
Taxonomy.
The taxonomy of Caribbean sloths is in flux, with the number of species present among the Pleistocene-Holocene taxa in question; some species are likely junior synonyms, while the diversity of some genera is probably understated. The mitochondrial DNA study suggests that ""Acratocnus ye"" and ""Parocnus serus"" are deeply divergent from each other, having split during the Oligocene, suggesting an early radiation within the group. An alternative taxonomy of the group has been proposed including the families Acratocnidae and Parocnidae within a new superfamily, Megalocnoidea.
Based on White and MacPhee (2001): and Vinola-Lopez et al. 2022
For other sloth taxa of the Caribbean, see Pilosans of the Caribbean.
Phylogeny.
The following sloth family phylogenetic tree is based on collagen and mitochondrial DNA sequence data (see Fig. 4 of Presslee ""et al""., 2019).
Extinction.
Sloths in the Caribbean survived about 5,000 years longer than ground sloths on the mainland. On Cuba the latest date for ""Megalocnus"" is calibrated 4700 years Before Present (BP). approximately 2700 BC. while dates for ""Parocnus browni"" are around 6250 BP (4250 BC). On Hispaniola the dates for some indeterminate sloth specimens are around 5000 BP (3000 BC); these dates roughly coincide with the first settlement of the Caribbean, which suggests that humans were the cause of the extinction. Remains Caribbean sloths have been found in a number of archaeological sites suggesting that they may have been consumed by the earliest inhabitants of the Caribbean, although evidence of hunting is inconclusive."
2,"The black baza (Aviceda leuphotes) is a small bird of prey found in the forests of Northeast India, the eastern Himalayas, China and Southeast Asia. Many populations are migratory, including those in the Indian region, which winter in the south of the Peninsula and Sri Lanka. Black bazas have short, stout legs and feet with strong talons, and a prominent crest. They are found in dense forest, often in small groups, and can often be found perched on bare branches of tall trees rising above the forest canopy.
Taxonomy and systematics.
The bird was first described based on a specimen from Pondicherry under the name of ""Falco leuphotes"". Several geographic races have been described including ""wolfei"" which is based on a single specimen from Sichuan and may belong to the nominate subspecies. The named forms include the following, but they have been questioned and further study has been called for.
Description.
The black baza is a small and distinctively coloured raptor; it ranges from 30 to 35Êcm in length, a 66 to 80Êcm wingspan and a weight of 168 to 224 g. When perched, the upright crest and contrasting patterns make it difficult to misidentify. The male has white scapulars, secondary coverts and on the secondaries. The female has white only on the scapulars and more chestnut bands on the underside unlike the few bands in the male.
While flying, it is similar to a crow and is often seen in small groups or flocks during migration. During migration, they are gregarious at their roost. They are somewhat crepuscular and more active at dusk and in overcast weather.
They feed mainly on insects by making aerial sallies. They may also pick insects off a leaf, the insects always seized with their feet. They have been observed to attempt capturing small birds such as wagtails by making dashes into flocks. They have been noted to join mixed-species foraging flocks. It has also been known to feed on the fruits of the oil palm. They are somewhat crepuscular in habit. The call is a ""chu-weep"" somewhat similar to the call of the large cuckoo-shrike. Other descriptions include a soft squeal or whistle and a shrill gull-like mewing.
Like others in the genus ""Aviceda"" they have two tooth like indentations on the edge of the upper bill. Birds are said to have a disagreeable odour which has been described as ""bug-like"".
Distribution.
This species is found in Southeast Asia and parts of South Asia. They are migratory in parts of their range. Migratory birds may be seen in large numbers at some locations such as Chumphon in Thailand where they account for nearly 40% of the raptors on passage. In some parts of Hong Kong, they have established themselves in recent times changing from summer visitors to residents in small numbers.
In southern India the species is regularly reported in winter mainly from the Western Ghats (breeding records have been questioned), Eastern Ghats (mainly on spring passage) and known to breed in northeastern India and Burma. Winter records of the species include stray occurrences in or near metropolitan areas such as the Guindy National Park in Chennai, near Trivandrum
and Bangalore. More recent studies have suggested that the species may be a regular winter visitor in the eastern part of peninsular India, and not just a passage migrant. Individuals have also been noted at Point Calimere.
The birds in northeastern India begin to breed in April. Both sexes take part in nest building, incubation, brooding and feeding. The nest is a firm platform of thin sticks with a central depression and lined with grass, fiber and overlaid with green leaves. The eggs take about 26Ð27 days to hatch. Insects are the predominant food of the chicks."
3,"The Qinling panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca qinlingensis), also known as the brown panda, is a subspecies of the giant panda, discovered in 1959, but not recognized as a subspecies until 2005. Besides the nominate subspecies, it is the first giant panda subspecies to be recognized.
Characteristics.
It differs from the more familiar nominate subspecies by its smaller skull and dark brown and light brown (rather than black and white) fur, and its smaller overall size. Its eye spots are under the lower lid, instead of around the eyes. Brown pandas are exceedingly rare.
Most Qinling pandas are around the same size as a giant pandas, growing to in length and at shoulder height. The males of the species are heavier than females, weighing roughly whereas females are likely to weigh .
Distribution and habitat.
This subspecies is restricted to the Qinling Mountains, at elevations of . Its coloration is possibly a consequence of inbreeding: as the population is closed off from genetic variation and this might have led to the preservation of the mutation responsible.
Conservation and threats.
There are an estimated 200Ð300 Qinling pandas living in the wild as of 2023, up from 100 in 2001.
On August 30, 1989, a female of this species was captured and brought to the Xi'an Qinling Wildlife Park to be mated with a regular giant panda. This panda's offspring was black-and-white, but reportedly started becoming brownish as it aged. According to other reports she gave birth to three cubs, all of whom died shortly after being born. The mother, named Dan-Dan, died in 2000.
Scientists captured a Brown Panda along with his mother, a black and white panda, in 2009. They called him Qizai. Research signifies that the change in color was a cause of a mutation. There was a missing sequence of DNA in a gene known as ""Bace2. Bace2"" is a gene responsible for pigmentation in organisms. In order to verify their findings were accurate, scientists underwent an experiment testing mice where they utilized CRISPR-Cas9, a gene-editing tool. The team was able to manipulate the sequence of the mice DNA by deleting the mutation causing segment. Researchers reported that the 78 tested mice did have genetic changes in response to the experiment. The melanosomes count decreased, as well as the size of them. The coats of the genetically altered mice also had light-colored coats. Additionally, researchers were able to uncover a preserved tissue sample from Dandan, where they concluded she had the same recessive trait as Qizai.
Due to the Qinling subspecies being restricted in range, it has been exposed to metal intoxicates such as copper, nickel, lead, and zinc that are now present in bamboo and soil as a result of the environmental pollution that is ongoing in China. More specifically, studies have indicated that the Qinling subspecies faces such anthropogenic threats so directly due to the fact that heavy concentrations of metals in bamboo and soil are positively correlated with high elevations, thus the Qinling Mountain Range is increasingly affected.
Dental health is important for the survival of the Qinling Pandas. These pandas have a survival rate of 5Ð20 years. The reliance on bamboo while having a carnivore digestive system results in energy and nutritional challenges and affects the oral health of these pandas. They feed on bamboo for at least 14 hours a day, which causes their teeth to wear out. The most common dental abnormalities that Qinling Pandas face are dental attrition and fractures. These two abnormalities can impact the survival rate of these pandas.
The scientists then conducted a wider analysis of 192 black-and-white giant pandas to verify the responsible gene as Bace2. The mutation causing the brown coats was only present in two pandas hailing from the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi, not Sichuan province, where the majority of China's giant pandas live.The Qinling panda (Brown Panda) is endangered. In fact, there are only around 100 Qinling pandas still living in the wild. The Qinling is a relative of the giant panda, discovered in the 1960s. It's different from the giant panda even though they are closely related and classified as a subspecies of giant pandas.
Qinling pandas much like their relatives the giant pandas, eat only bamboo species. Qinling pandas consume both species of bamboo that grow in the Qin mountains"
4,"Humblot's heron (Ardea humbloti), also known as the Madagascar heron, is a species of heron. It is commonly found on the north and west coasts of Madagascar but it is also present in the Comoro Islands and Mayotte. Humblot's heron is considered an endangered species due to its declining population. The major threats the heron faces are poaching, habitat destruction, and the invasion of alien species such as the water hyacinth. 
Taxonomy.
Humblot's heron is part of the subfamily Ardeinae, which are known as ""typical herons"". It has been suggested that Humblot's heron may be a darker morph of the grey heron due to their many similar physical characteristics, but this claim has been successfully refuted. Humblot's heron was formally described by Henri Milne-Edwards and Alfred Grandidier in 1885.
Local Malagasy names for Humblot's heron include ""Kisirano"", ""Langaro"" and ""Langaroko"", however these names are also associated with different species of herons, such as the grey heron.
The scientific name commemorates the French naturalist Leon Humblot.
Description.
Humblot's heron has a uniform dark gray plumage on its body and darker feathers on its forehead and chin. Its nape feathers are elongated to form a crest. It has a large, pale bill as well as pale eyes and legs.
Humblot's heron is tall. Its body weight can range between . The bill length ranges from while the bill depth ranges from .
Distribution and habitat.
Humblot's heron is endemic to the island of Madagascar and is most commonly found in the coastal lowlands of southern, western and northern Madagascar. Small populations have also been found in the neighboring islands of Comoros and Mayotte. There has been one recorded and accepted observation of the heron in mainland Africa, in a game reserve in Tanzania. The total population of Humblot's heron in Madagascar was estimated in 2006 at 1,000 to 3,000 individuals.
Humblot's heron inhabits fresh, brackish or saltwater wetlands. It prefers tidal areas but also inhabits lakes, rivers, mangroves and estuaries. It is found most commonly at low elevations but has been recorded up to an altitude of . It does not migrate, however it is able to disperse over long distances, as shown by its presence in mainland Africa.
Behavior.
Diet.
Humblot's heron primarily eats medium and large-sized fish as well as crustaceans. They forage on floating vegetation in clear, shallow water or in the ingoing and outgoing tides. They are passive feeders, therefore they remain stationary for long periods of time, often hunched or with their neck extended over the water. After catching their prey, they will fly to solid ground to consume it.
Reproduction.
Little information is known about its breeding cycle. Nesting has been observed year-round. Nests are typically on the ground and surrounded by dense aquatic vegetation. They can also be found in trees between tall. In Mayotte, the heron was observed nesting in mangroves. 
The Humblot's heron's nest is mostly made of sticks and reeds and is approximately in diameter. Their eggs are blue and the typical clutch size is 3 eggs. Both parents take turns incubating the eggs.
Vocalizations.
Its vocalizations are similar to the vocalizations of the grey heron. It is an irregular barking sound that lasts 0.5-1.0 s. Humblot's heron is also known to rattle its bill quietly while in its nest.
Conservation status.
Humblot's heron is considered endangered, per the IUCN Red List. Its population is declining most likely due to poaching, both of the eggs and of the bird. Additionally, due to the increasing human population in Western Madagascar, the wetlands where the heron nests are being transformed more and more into rice paddies. The increasingly drier climate is also contributing to the degradation of their preferred nesting habitats. The rate at which its population is decreasing has not yet been established."
5,"The New Caledonian rail (Cabalus lafresnayanus) is a large and drab flightless rail endemic to the island of New Caledonia in the Pacific. It is Critically Endangered, may have gone extinct many decades ago already, and if it still exists it is one of the least-known living bird species.
It is a large rail, about 45 cm long, dull brown above, with grey underparts, and has a yellowish, downward-curving bill. The feathers are fluffy and silky, rendering the bird unable to fly; its wings are also reduced (but not as much as in other flightless rails). Due to it having not been seen since the 1890s, its call and daily habits are not known, but it is presumed to be a shy woodland species and possibly active at night, dusk or dawn.
Taxonomy and evolution.
The binomial commemorates the French ornithologist Frederic de Lafresnaye. The New Caledonian rail's relationships have long confounded ornithologists due to the paucity of specimens and the nondescript appearance, the derived flightlessness obscuring anatomical evidence of relationships. Often, it was believed to be closely allied to the Lord Howe woodhen Ð if only due to them being similarly drab rails from islands across the southern Coral Sea Ð, these two being included in a loosely-defined genus ""Gallirallus"", or separated as genus Tricholimnas. Other authors considered ""Tricholimnas"" to contain only the present species, arguing that the Lord Howe woodhen, while looking superficially similar, was closer to the smaller species of the ""Hypotaenidia"" group among the loosely-defined ""Gallirallus"" Ð as was ultimately corroborated by DNA data.
By the mid-2010s, there was general agreement to split up the wastebin taxon ""Gallirallus"", the New Caledonian rail often being included in the reinstated genus ""Cabalus"" along with the confirmed-extinct Chatham rail (""C. modestus""). However, as it turned out since the first early-2010s studies, different types of molecular data tend to strongly disagree about the placement of the Chatham and New Caledonian rails relative to each other and their closest relatives, more so if anatomical data of extinct species are included in the analysis. As far as it has been studied, the New Caledonian rail invariably turns out well distinct and basal to the ""Hypotaenidia"" group (including the Lord Howe woodhen); the Chatham rail, however, may actually resolve close to or even in ""Hypotaenidia"" depending on which extinct taxa are included in the analyses. Some early mitochondrial DNA data, meanwhile, found the New Caledonian rail close to the weka and conceivably even warranting inclusion in the genus ""Gallirallus"" which is otherwise restricted to the weka (and its prehistoric ancestors) today. Adding to the confusion, the Mauritian Red rail is another extinct, roughly weka-sized, flightless and brownish-feathered rail which tends to ally with the species basal to ""Hypotaenidia"", Woodford's rail (formerly in ""Nesoclopeus"") may appear within or outside that genus, while Chestnut rail (""Eulabeornis"") and Calayan rail (""Aptenorallus"") are usually but not invariably basal to the entire aforementioned group containing the bulk of the former ""Gallirallus"".
Across recent analyses it was noted that the placement of the New Caledonian rail, whatever it might be, was among the less well-supported. What can be said with certainty is that ""Hypotaenidia"" is the most advanced radiation of a clade of smallish to largish rails, whose basal evolutionary grade consists of larger species, many being flightless island endemics and often extinct. As well as the ""wastebin"" ""Gallirallus"", this clade seems to contain the flightless and Ð apart from ""Habroptila"" Ð extinct island species Invisible rail (""Habroptila""), Rodrigues rail (""Erythromachus""), Hawkins's rail (""Diaphorapteryx""), Snipe-rail (""Capellirallus""), possibly the Fiji rail (""Vitirallus""), and maybe even some of the larger species of supposed ""Porzana"" crakes of the Hawaiian Islands. Resolving to what extent these species form clades within the basal grade will determine which of the plethora of monotypic genera are actually valid, and whether the New Caledonian rail is indeed correctly placed in ""Cabalus"" or would once again go back into ""Gallirallus"" or ""Tricholimnas"". In particular ""Capellirallus"" is relevant in this regard, since it is small, thin-billed, and from the New Zealand region, like the Chatham rail but quite unlike the large and stout-billed New Caledonian rail.
All this nonwithstanding, all evidence suggests that the New Caledonian rail belongs to tribe Rallini of subfamily Rallinae, wherein it is one of the few survivors of the initial radiation. This extended throughout almost the entire Middle to Late Miocene, about 15 to 7 million years ago, and probably started with the descendants of a South to Southeast Asian rail expanding across southeastwards across Wallacea into Melanesia and beyond. Around the time the ancestral ""Hypotaenidia"" started to spread northeastwards across Polynesia and into Micronesia, about 5 million years ago, the ancestors of the New Caledonian rail also split off the lineage leading to its closest known ancestor, whether this is the Chatham Rail, the weka, or any other species.
Ecology and status.
This bird is supposed to live in evergreen forests and, if still extant, seems to have moved higher up on the island'S mountains to escape introduced predators. 
It is (or was) host to a species of parasite, the phtilopterid louse ""Rallicola piageti"" that is not believed to have occurred on any other bird species. Hence, ""R. piageti"" may be coextinct.
This cryptic rail is only known from seventeen specimens taken between 1860 and 1890 on New Caledonia. It most likely was driven to extinction from predation by feral cats, dogs, and pigs. Though the bird has not been confirmed since 1890, unconfirmed reports from the 1960s and 1984 say that some still live in the higher montane forests. A survey in 1998 produced no firm evidence from hunters or fieldwork. However, it may still persist in small numbers in isolated areas."
6,"Arctocyon ('bear dog') is an extinct genus of ungulate mammals. ""Arctocyon"" was a ""ground dwelling omnivore"", that lived from 61.3-56.8 Ma. Synonyms of ""Arctocyon"" include ""Claenodon"", and ""Neoclaenodon"". ""Arctocyon"" was likely plantigrade, meaning that it walked with its feet flat on the ground, rather than on its toes.
Description.
The members belonging to this genus were of variable size: they could be of the size of a large dog (such as ""Arctocyon primaevus"") but also of a small bear (such as ""A. mumak"") ""Arctocyon"" had relatively short and strong legs, equipped with claw-like hooves. The skull was long and robust, bearing a pronounced sagittal crest. This served as an anchor for strong chewing muscles. The teeth possessed a strange mix of ""herbivore"" and ""carnivore"" characteristics. The molars were powerful and grinding, similar to those of a bear (hence the name ""Arctocyon"", meaning ""bear-dog""). The incisors would seem to have been suitable for plucking foliage, while the canines were very elongated, forming what were effectively tusks. The lower canines, in particular, were exceptionally developed and were much more robust and longer than the upper ones. There was not as much disparity as in ""Mentoclaenodon"", which possessed elongated upper canines.
A study carried out on the fossils of the species ""A. primaevus"" indicated that the postcranial skeleton of ""Arctocyon"" was equally peculiar. Some features suggest the ability to climb, such as development of the adductor and abductor muscles, development of the flexor muscles of the fingers (which allowed the ability to grasp), highly mobile joints, convex ulna and foot plantigrade with five fingers. However, in contrast to the very mobile paw joints, ""Arctocyon"" also possessed a very rigid posterior thoracic region, characterized by a revolute zygapophysis, unknown in modern mammals. The morphology of the first caudal vertebra also indicates that the tail was long, powerful and muscular, with a rigid base: it probably played a fundamental role in locomotion. The morphology of the hind legs was similar to that of the front legs: the development of the adductors, flexors and rotators of the mobile joints of the pelvis was highly developed.
The gigantic species ""A. mumak"" had different specializations: some characteristics of the tarsus, such as the great plantar tubercle on the navicular and a well-developed furrow below the ""sustentaculum tali"", indicate that this species must have been of terrestrial and possibly fossorial habits.
Classification.
The genus ""Arctocyon"" was first described by de Blainville in 1841, on the basis of well-preserved fossil remains from the upper Paleocene sediments of France. The type species is ""Arctocyon primaevus"", known for numerous fossil remains from various French deposits. Other species attributed to this genus are known in North America: ""A. ferox"", described by Edward Drinker Cope in 1883 and known from fossils discovered in New Mexico, Wyoming, Alberta and Montana, similar in size to the European species. ""A. mumak"", the largest species, was described by Van Valen in 1978 and subsequently found in Wyoming, Texas, Colorado and Saskatchewan. This species, initially known for an isolated jaw, was later well-studied thanks to an incomplete skeleton found in 1963 in the Bighorn Basin in Wyoming. Other North American species are ""A. corrugatus"" and ""A. acrogenius""; the some specimens of which being ascribed to the species ""A. mumak"". Other remains attributed to ""Arctocyon"" have been found in Germany.
""Arctocyon"" is the eponymous genus of the family Arctocyonidae, a group of archaic mammals with uncertain affinities, once classified in the heterogeneous order of the Condylarthra and currently classified within either the basal Artiodactyla or Ferae. ""Arctocyon"" includes some of the largest arctocyonids ever to have lived, and was certainly a specialized member of the group. Similar to ""Arctocyon"" was ""Arctocyonides"", also found in the French Palaeocene deposits but of smaller dimensions and leaner build. Another interesting arctocyonid is ""Mentoclaenodon"", which possessed even more elongated canines.
Paleoecology.
This animal probably had an omnivorous diet: the molariform teeth indicate that ""Arctocyon's"" teeth could grind plant material, but the incisors, and in particular, the large canines, indicate the ability to feed on meat. The postcranial skeleton also suggests a mixed diet, even if the morphology is not found in any modern mammal. Some species of ""Arctocyon"" (e.g. ""A. primaevus"") undoubtedly had the ability to climb trees, while others (""A. mumak"") were certainly terrestrial and may have been burrowers or even fossorial.
One study indicated that ""A. primaevus"", morphologically, was more similar to some extinct South American marsupial mammals, such as the Sparassodonta, than to any other mammal. The general size and proportions are a mix between ""Borhyaena"" and ""Prothylacinus"", while some characteristics (the development of ridges and processes on the humerus) made it similar to ""Prothylacinus"". In general, it appears that ""Arctocyon"" and its close relatives, with their tusk-like canines and molariform teeth indicating an omnivorous diet, and a skeleton more like that of carnivores than that of ungulates, represented a very unusual mosaic of features, and thus their paleobiology and paleoecology are therefore very difficult to establish."
7,"Reeves's pheasant (Syrmaticus reevesii) is a large pheasant within the genus ""Syrmaticus"". It is endemic to China. It is named after the British naturalist John Reeves, who first introduced live specimens to Europe in 1831.
Description.
Males measure long and weigh . The male is brightly plumaged with a scaled golden white and red body plumage, grey legs, brown iris and bare red skin around the eye. The head is white with a black narrow band across its eyes. The male has an extremely long silvery white tail barred with chestnut brown. This pheasant is mentioned in the 2008 edition of ""Guinness World Records"" for having the longest natural tail feather of any bird species; a record formerly held by the crested argus pheasant. The tail can measure up to long.
Females measure long and weigh . They are brown with a blackish crown, a buff face and greyish brown barred tail feathers. The females are about the same size as a male common pheasant.
There are no known subspecies, but there is some variation in plumage.
Distribution and habitat.
The Reeves's pheasant is endemic to the temperate evergreen and deciduous forests of central and eastern China. Where introduced, they also inhabit farmland close to woodlands. The tail of the male bird grows approximately every year.
They have been introduced for sport and ornamental purposes to the United States, Czech Republic, France and the United Kingdom. In the latter three countries, they have built up small breeding populations, and are still released on a small scale for shooting, often alongside common pheasants.
Behaviour.
The Reeves's pheasant is a hardy bird and is able to tolerate both hot and cold weather. They prefer higher ground for nesting. The female lays a clutch of 7Ð14 eggs in April or May; the incubation period is 24Ð25 days. Reeves's pheasants are often aggressive towards humans, animals, and other pheasants, particularly during the breeding season.
Their call is unlike other game birds in that it is a musical warble, sounding more passerine than a galliform bird. Their diet is vegetable matter, including seeds and cereals. They are fairly common in aviculture.
Conservation.
Due to ongoing habitat loss, and overhunting for food and its tail plumes, the Reeves's pheasant is evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. There are thought to be only around 2000 birds remaining in the wild.
The species is included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning international export/import (including in parts and derivatives such as feathers) requires CITES documentation to be obtained and presented to border authorities."
8,"The sultan tit (Melanochlora sultanea) is an Asian forest bird with a yellow crest, dark bill, black upperparts plumage and yellow underparts. The sexes are similar. The female has greenish-black upperparts and a yellowish throat. The young bird is duller than the adult and has a shorter crest. It is the only member of the monotypic genus Melanochlora, which is fairly distinct from the ""Parus"" tits with the nearest relative being the monotypic ""Sylviparus"".
Description.
The male has the forehead and crown with the crest brilliant yellow; the whole upper plumage, sides of the head and neck, chin, throat, and breast-deep black glossed with green, the edges of the feathers of the upper plumage with a metallic lustre, and the outermost tail-feathers tipped with white; lower plumage from the breast downwards deep yellow, the thighs barred or mottled with white. The recumbent crest is raised when the bird is alert or alarmed.
The female has the yellow parts duller; the upper plumage and sides of the head dark greenish-brown; the chin and throat glossed dark olive-green; wings and tail dull black; the feathers of the upper plumage edged with metallic green.
The young resemble the female, but in the youngest stage the bright edges to the plumage of the upper parts are absent, and the greater wing coverts are edged with white.
They forage in the mid and upper canopy singly or in small groups mainly and feed mainly on insects but sometimes feed on figs. Their loud calls with short repeated and variable whistling notes have a tit-like quality. The flight is slow and fluttery.
The bill is black; the mouth dark fleshy; the eyelids grey; the iris dark brown; the legs are grey; the claws dark horn. The length is about 8Êinches; the tail measures 3.8Êinches; the wing 4.4Êinches; the tarsus 0.95Êinches; the bill from the gape 0.75Êinches. The body mass is from .
Taxonomy and systematics.
In 1890, Richard Bowdler Sharpe considered this species as a member of the former subfamily Liotrichinae within the Timaliidae. The position of this species within its clade is still not clearly established. They appear to have distinctive mtDNA cytochrome ""b"" sequences, suggesting that they might not belong to the Paridae unless the penduline tits are included. They show an unusual behaviour of panicking in captivity when they encounter unusual noise or other species which has been said to be unlike that of typical Paridae members. Unlike other Paridae, their nostrils are exposed and not covered by feathers.
Distribution.
Four subspecies are recognized with the nominate ""sultanea"" (Hodgson, 1837) found from Central Nepal into the eastern Himalayas extending into North-eastern Bangladesh, Myanmar, northern Thailand and Southern China. This intergrades with the race ""flavocristata"" (Lafresnaye, 1837) is found further south in Thailand, the Malay Peninsula and Hainan. Race ""seorsa"" (with dark shaft streaks in the crest) is found in Laos and parts of southeastern China (Guangxi, Fujian) and in its northern range intergrades with ""sultanea"". Subspecies ""gayeti"" named after the collector M.V. Gayet-Laroche by Delacour &amp; Jabouille in 1925 has a black crest in both males and females and is found in Laos and Vietnam.
In India, this species occurs in the lower ranges of the Himalayas from Nepal to the head of the Assam valley, the Khasi Hills, Cachar, Manipur, the Kakhyen hills east of Bhamo, Arrakan, the Pegu hills, Karennee, and Tenasserim. This species does not appear to be found above 4000 feet of elevation. It extends down the Malay peninsula. It frequents the larger trees in small flocks. In some forest areas such as the Buxa Tiger Reserve, the density has been estimated at around 15 per square kilometre.
Sultan tits are vocal with several calls including a rattling ""chi-dip, tri-trip"", harsh explosive hissing calls and squeaky reppeated ""wheet"" whistles.
The breeding season in India is April to July and the clutch is of five to seven eggs laid inside a lined tree cavity. They feed on caterpillars and sometimes small berries.
Widely distributed within suitable habitats throughout its large range, the Sultan Tit is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species."
9,"The yellow-throated marten (Martes flavigula) is a marten species native to the Himalayas, Southeast and East Asia. Its coat is bright yellow-golden, and its head and back are distinctly darker, blending together black, white, golden-yellow and brown. It is the second-largest marten in the Old World, after the Nilgiri marten, with its tail making up more than half its body length. 
It is an omnivore, whose sources of food range from fruit and nectar to invertebrates, rodents, lagomorphs, reptiles and birds, and to small primates and ungulates. It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List due to its wide distribution, stable population, occurrence in a number of protected areas and an apparent lack of threats.
Characteristics.
The yellow-throated marten has short bright brownish-yellow fur, a blackish brown pointed head, reddish cheeks, light brown chin and lower lips; the chest and lower part of the throat are orange-golden, and flanks and belly are bright yellowish. The back of the ears is black, the inner portions are yellowish grey. The front paws, lower forelimbs are black. The tail is black above with a greyish brown base and a lighter tip.
It is robust and muscular, has an elongated thorax, a long neck and a long tail, which is about 2/3 as long as its body. The limbs are relatively short and strong, with broad paws. The ears are large and broad with rounded tips. The soles of the feet are covered with coarse, flexible hairs, though the digital and foot pads are naked and the paws are weakly furred. The baculum is S-shaped, with four blunt processes occurring on the tip. It is larger than other Old World martens; males measure in body length, while females measure . Males weigh , while females weigh . The anal glands sport two unusual protuberances, which secrete a strong smelling liquid for defensive purposes.
Distribution and habitat.
The yellow-throated marten occurs in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in the Himalayas of India, Nepal and Bhutan, continental southern China and Taiwan, the Korean Peninsula and eastern Russia. In the south, its range extends to Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, the Malay Peninsula, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.
In Pakistan, it was recorded in Musk Deer National Park.
In Nepal's Kanchenjunga Conservation Area, it has been recorded up to an elevation of in alpine meadow.
In northeastern India, it has been reported in northern West Bengal, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Assam. In Indonesia it occurs in Borneo, Sumatra, and Java.
Behaviour and ecology.
The yellow-throated marten holds extensive, but not permanent, home ranges. It actively patrols its territory, having been known to cover in a single day and night. It primarily hunts on the ground, but can climb trees proficiently, being capable of making jumps up to between branches. After March snowfalls, the yellow-throated marten restricts its activities to treetops.
Diet.
The yellow-throated marten is a diurnal hunter, which usually hunts in pairs, but may also hunt in packs of three or more. It preys on rats, mice, hares, snakes, lizards, eggs and ground nesting birds such as pheasants and francolins. It is reported to kill cats and poultry. It has been known to feed on human corpses, and was once thought to be able to attack an unarmed man in groups of three to four. It preys on small ungulates and smaller marten species, such as sables. In the Himalayas and Myanmar, it is reported to frequently kill muntjac fawns, while in Ussuriland the base of its diet consists of musk deer, particularly in winter. Two or three yellow-throated martens can consume a musk deer carcass in 2 to 3 days. It also kills the young of larger ungulate species within a weight range of , including young spotted deer, roe deer and goral. Wild boar piglets are also taken on occasion. It has also been reported to trail tigers and feed on their kills.
In China, it preys on giant panda cubs.
It supplements its diet with nectar and fruit, and is therefore considered to be an important seed disperser.
Reproduction.
Estrus occurs twice a year, from mid-February to late March and from late June to early August. During these periods, the males fight each other for access to females. Litters typically consist of two or three kits and rarely four.
Predators.
The yellow-throated marten has few predators, but occasionally may fall foul of larger carnivores; remains of sporadic individuals have turned up in the scat or stomachs of Siberian tigers (""Panthera tigris"") and Asian black bears (""Ursus thibetanus""). A mountain hawk-eagle (""Nisaetus nipalensis"") killed an adult yellow-throated marten.
Conservation.
The yellow-throated marten is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List due to its wide distribution and occurrence in protected areas across its range; the global population is stable, and threats are apparently lacking.
Taxonomy.
The first written description of the yellow-throated marten in the Western World is given by Thomas Pennant in his ""History of Quadrupeds"" (1781), in which he named it ""White-cheeked Weasel"". Pieter Boddaert featured it in his ""Elenchus Animalium"" with the name ""Mustela flavigula"". For a long period after the ""Elenchus""' publication, the existence of the yellow-throated marten was considered doubtful by many zoologists, until a skin was presented to the Museum of the East India Company in 1824 by Thomas Hardwicke.
, nine subspecies are recognized."
