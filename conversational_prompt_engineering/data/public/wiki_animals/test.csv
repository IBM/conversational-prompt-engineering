Przewalski's gazelle,"Przewalski's gazelle (Procapra przewalskii) is a member of the family Bovidae, and in the wild, is found only in China. Once widespread, its range has declined to six populations near Qinghai Lake. The gazelle was named after Nikolai Przhevalsky, a Russian explorer who collected a specimen and brought it back to St. Petersburg in 1875.

Przewalski's gazelles are relatively small, slender antelopes with large eyes and short, pointed ears. The nasal bones are relatively large, suggesting an adaptation to the thin air of the Tibetan plateau. They have a head and body length of 109 to 160 cm (43 to 63 in), a shoulder height of 50 to 70 cm (20 to 28 in), and weigh between 17 and 32 kg (37 and 71 lb). Males are generally larger and heavier than the females. The tail is short, measuring only 7 to 10 cm (2.8 to 3.9 in), and is often entirely hidden by fur.
The animal is yellowish brown with a white underside and a white heart-shaped patch on its rump, partially bisected by a light brown vertical line. Males are darker in colour than females, and the coat of both sexes is more noticeably greyish in winter. The fur lacks an undercoat, consisting only of dense guard hairs. Male Przewalski's gazelles have ridged horns, which rise between the eyes and curve inwards at the tips; in younger males, the tips may actually touch, but they diverge as the animal ages. In the adult, the horns reach 18 to 26 cm (7.1 to 10.2 in) in length. The females are hornless.
Przewalski's gazelle is similar in appearance to both the Tibetan gazelle and the Mongolian gazelle, to both of which it is closely related, and occurs in similar geographic areas. It is intermediate in size between the other two species, and can most easily be distinguished from them by the shape of its horns.

Until the early 20th century, Przewalski's gazelle was widespread across the high plateaus of northwestern China and Inner Mongolia. However, it is now found only in a single small area around Qinghai Lake, having been extirpated across the great majority of its former range. It inhabits flat open valleys and steppeland between mountains, and the sand dunes and semi-desert zones around lakes.
Two sub-species have been described, although one is now believed to be extinct:

P. przewalskii przewalskii - Qinghai
P. przewalskii diversicornis † - Gansu and the Ordos Loop region

The preferred diet of Pzewalski's gazelles consists of sedges and grasses, supplemented by herbs and shrubs such as Astragalus. They are often found foraging together with Tibetan gazelles, but do not compete for resources because the latter animal prefers legumes. Such associations with a related species allow for larger herds, which may help protect both species from predators.
The gazelle usually travels in small groups, with rarely more than a dozen individuals, although much larger herds were reported in the 19th century, when the overall population was higher. Males are often solitary or travel in small groups of two or three individuals for much of the year, but gather together in small herds with the females during the winter rut.
Przewalski's gazelles are generally quiet, but have been reported to make short bleating sounds.

Przewalski's gazelles rut from late December to early January. Males scent mark small territories and clash with rivals, fighting with their horns. Females have also been observed fighting for access to males. Courtship consists of the male moving towards the female while standing on his hind legs, and is followed by a brief copulation.
Gestation lasts around six months, so that the young are born around May or June. The mother gives birth to a single offspring, usually in thickets or areas of tall grass, where they can be concealed from potential predators. The young are able to follow their mother within a few minutes of birth, although they may remain concealed for a few days before rejoining the herd. Females become fertile during their second year, around 18 months of age. The lifespan of Przewalski's gazelles is unknown, although based on that of related species, it is probably around eight years.

Przewalski's gazelle is perhaps one of the most endangered species of large mammal on Earth. The many threats against the species include competition with domestic livestock and fencing of the natural habitat. These problems have become exacerbated as the area is increasingly developed as agricultural land.
While now protected by Chinese law, and illegal hunting no longer is considered an important factor, a large percentage of the habitat of this species has already been lost due to human activities. Consequently, it is considered to be an endangered species by the IUCN. Formerly, it was believed that as few as 250 remained, and it was considered critically endangered. However, this is now known to be an underestimate, with new subpopulations having been discovered in 2003 and 2006, and there were believed to be 350-400 (and possibly even more) mature individuals left. By 2020, the population had exceeded 2,700, but the species continued to face severe threats.

Siberian bat,"The Siberian bat or Siberian whiskered myotis (Myotis sibiricus) is a species of vesper bat in the family Vespertilionidae. It is found throughout northeastern Asia, primarily in Siberia. It is known for its high life expectancy relative to its body size, approximately twice that of humans, and holds the record for the oldest bat; in 2005, one individual was discovered in a cave in Siberia that had been banded in 1964, making the bat at least 41 years old.

It was previously classified within the Brandt's bat (M. brandtii), but more recent phylogenetic studies have found deep genetic divergence between both taxa, indicating that both are distinct species from one another, and they have thus been split by authorities including the American Society of Mammalogists, the IUCN Red List, and ITIS.

It is found throughout much of the Palearctic east of the Ob River, from eastern Kazakhstan east throughout southern Siberia to the Kamchatka Peninsula, and south to northern China, northern Mongolia, North Korea, and northern South Korea. It is also known from Sakhalin & the Kuril Islands in Russia, and Hokkaido in Japan. It inhabits both lowland and mountain forests as well as forest-steppe ecosystems. During the summer it takes shelter in tree hollows, caves, and even buildings, but it winters exclusively in caves.

It is a small bat, with the length of its head and body only 39–51 mm (1.5–2.0 in). Its forearm is 33–39 mm (1.3–1.5 in) long; its tail is 32–44 mm (1.3–1.7 in) long; its hind feet are 7–9 mm (0.28–0.35 in) long; its ears are 12–17 mm (0.47–0.67 in). It has long fur relative to its body size. The fur on its back is pale brown with a golden sheen, while the fur on its ventral side is paler gray, sometimes with a yellowish tinge. Its tragus is narrow and pointed.

Populations in Siberia have exceptionally long hibernation periods, beginning in late September and continuing through mid-June of the following year. During the winter, Siberian bats will roost in mine shafts, caves, tunnels, and cellars. Some – but not all – populations hibernate in the winter, while others are partially migratory. They are insectivorous, foraging at low altitudes through quick, maneuverable flight.

During the summer, females will form maternity colonies to raise their young.  The litter size is one pup, though occasionally two are born.  Pups are born in early summer, with pups becoming volant around one month of age.  Maternity colonies are frequently in manmade structures.

In the early 1960s, 1,544 Siberian bats were banded in Siberia. Of these individuals, at least 67 lived longer than 20 years (of note, all of these individuals were male). In 2001, two individuals were documented 38 years after capture, making them, at the time, the longest-lived individuals of this species ever recorded. However, three years later, one of these individuals was documented again. This meant that the longest-lived individual of this species was at least 41 years old. In mammals, larger animals tend to have longer lifespans than smaller ones; the Siberian bat is the most extreme outlier to this pattern, with lifespans exceeding 40 years in the wild while only weighing 4–8 g (0.14–0.28 oz).  Compared with other animals its size, it lives 9.8 times longer than expected, which is the greatest value of any mammal with a known lifespan.

Longevity quotient

This species is thought to have a declining population due to forest degradation and fragmentation, as well as the loss of roost sites in caves. The primary cause of forest loss is urban development, with deforestation and wildfires also playing a role in the decline. Disturbances by cavers are known to cause mortality in winter roosts. However, it has a wide population and is not thought to be declining at a rate that would qualify it for a more imperiled status, so it is classified as Least Concern.

Romer's tree frog,"Romer's tree frog (Liuixalus romeri) is a species of frog native to Hong Kong and a small portion of Guangxi, China. With an average snout-vent length of 1.5 – 2.5 cm, it is the smallest amphibian recorded in the territory. Despite its common name, it belongs to the family Rhacophoridae, instead of the Hylidae.

The female frog is slightly larger than the male. The body is tan brown, with the underside white. An X-like marking, made up of two crooked black lines, can be seen on the dorsum. Sometimes, the lines do not meet medially, thus leading to a chevron marking posteriorly. Underneath the X-like marking lies another upside-down V-like marking. The skin is peppered with fine granules. A distinct fold extends from the eye to the foreleg.
Romer's tree frog has a triangular but blunt snout with brown-spotted lips. Between the eyes is a dark bar, which extends to the eyelids. The hind legs are long, slender, and barred with irregular brown-to-black cross-bands. All digits have small toe pads, which allow the frog to hang on tree branches or leaves.

The habitat of the frog is well-wooded areas near small streams or other water sources suitable for breeding. This frog usually sits on low bushes, buries itself in fallen leaves, or rests on bare ground. The frog has been recorded solely from four of the outlying islands in Hong Kong, namely Lantau Island, Lamma Island, Po Toi Island and Chek Lap Kok. In 2007, the species was also reported from Guangxi, China, far from the Hong Kong population.
Its tadpoles and eggs are susceptible to predation by the introduced mosquitofish, and it is only able to breed in places where the fish has yet to colonise. The frog breeds in shallow water from early March to September. The male has a shrill, staccato call. The female glues up to 120 eggs onto submerged plant debris, stones, or vegetation. The tadpoles, brown in colour, require 4 to 6 weeks to metamorphose in captivity.
Adults feed on termites, and such small insects as crickets and arachnids such as spiders. The frog is strictly nocturnal. It lives about three years in the wild, but the female is reproductively active only for two breeding seasons.

Romer's tree frog was named after John D. Romer, who first discovered it in a cave on Lamma Island in 1952. That population disappeared in 1953 due to the collapse of the cave. Once thought to be extinct, the frog was rediscovered on the island in 1984.
Over 200 individuals of the species were rescued from Chek Lap Kok in 1992, before the construction of the new Hong Kong International Airport. The captives were bred successfully and the offspring were released into eight selected sites in Hong Kong Island and New Territories. The frogs in seven of the sites survived. Surprisingly, a very small number of them also survived in Chek Lap Kok.
As an endangered species, Romer's tree frog is protected under the law of Hong Kong (Wild Animals Protection Ordinance, Cap. 170). Part of Ngong Ping in Lantau, a site that supports the largest population of the frog has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest in May 1999.

Lesser prairie-chicken,"The lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) is a species in the grouse family.

Adult individuals are medium to large birds, striped white and brown like its near relative, the Greater prairie-chicken (T. cupido), though it is smaller and paler. Adults range from 15.0 to 16.1 inches (38 to 41 cm) in length and 22.1 to 28.7 ounces (630 to 810 g) in weight. Mature males sport yellow, comb-like feathers above each eye, as well as long head feathers that can be raised to show their pinkish-red Gular sacs. One is present on each side of the neck, which becomes inflated to be used in mating displays.

About half of its current population lives in western Kansas, with the other half in the sandhills and prairies of western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle including the Llano Estacado, eastern New Mexico, and southeastern Colorado.
They prefer environments containing sand sagebrush and shinnery oak, as well as various grasses and shrubs depending on the area.

Like its larger relative, it is known for its lekking behavior, particularly the “booming” call produced during mating displays. They typically prefer wide, open areas such as hills and ridges with short grass for their leks, however the use of man-made structures such as roads or oil platforms has also been observed. During the months of April and May, males will establish an area for themselves and potential mates, and will typically become territorial as the spring season progresses. This process is repeated to a lesser degree in the fall, beginning as early as late August and reaching a height in October. Males in particular are likely to return to the same territory repeatedly. 
Females will begin nesting following mating, most frequently in May. Nests are dug about 5-10 cm into the ground, with a width of up to 20cm. These nests are lined with grasses, leaves, and feathers, and may be located within taller grasses or beneath brush and shrubs for shade and shelter. A single brood usually contains 11-14 eggs, hatching about 23 days after being laid. Chicks become fledged within 4 weeks, and after 8-10, will be left on their own as the mother hen leaves to molt.

The majority of the lesser prairie-chicken’s diet consists of foraged seeds, insects, and crops, as well as leaves, fruits, and forb buds. All of these are eaten year-round based on availability, however adolescents under 10 weeks tend to eat mostly insects, and adults will as well during warmer months. In fall, they will mostly shift to eating seeds, as well as leaves and flowers in winter months. When available, crops such as corn and grains will be eaten if left out. Generally, this diet provides them with enough water to survive, and they will rarely drink directly without cover unless absolutely necessary.

Considered ""vulnerable"" by the IUCN due to its restricted and patchy range, it is vulnerable to habitat destruction, due to a combination of droughts, oil contamination, and conversion to farmland. The lesser prairie-chicken's habitat has been reduced by 85%, and their population has declined by about 97% since 1800, in part due to unrestricted hunting. Of the remaining patches of suitable habitat, only around 0.1% are sufficiently contiguous to sustain even a minimum population of the birds. There is evidence suggesting that global warming may have a particularly detrimental influence by greatly reducing the size of the sagebrush ecosystem. Subfossil remains are known, e.g., from Rocky Arroyo in the Guadalupe Mountains, outside the species' current range but where more habitat existed in the less humid conditions in the outgoing last ice age. Range contraction apparently took place no later than about 8000 BC.

On March 27, 2014, the lesser prairie-chicken was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act but the listing was vacated in 2015 following a legal challenge. On June 1, 2021, the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) proposed splitting the species into two segments. The northern one, covering Oklahoma, Colorado, Kansas, and a portion of Texas, would be listed as threatened, and the southern one, covering New Mexico and a portion of Texas, as endangered. On November 17, 2022, the USFWS published a final rule listing the Southern Distinct Population Segment (DPS) of the lesser prairie-chicken as endangered and the Northern DPS as threatened.  Implementation of the rule was delayed, and it took effect on March 27, 2023.
In 2015, Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan) introduced an amendment to legislation authorizing construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline that would overturn the listing. He disputed the listing as, ""... another example of unnecessary intrusion into private lives and businesses by the federal government."" His action was supported by the American Energy Alliance and opposed by the League of Conservation Voters.
When the Senate voted on the Keystone bill, it did not get the 60 votes in favor that was required to pass. It got only 53 Republican and one Democratic Senator to vote in favor.
The United States Department of the Interior proposed creating a lesser prairie-chicken preserve as a national monument, but action was never taken action on the proposal.
In May 2023, the U.S. Senate voted to strip the lesser prairie-chicken of its new listing using its authority under the Congressional Review Act. President Joe Biden's administration threatened to veto the bill if the House of Representatives passed it, which the House did on July 27. The bill was passed by the Senate, but vetoed by Biden on September 27, 2023.

Chinese leaf warbler,"The Chinese leaf warbler (Phylloscopus yunnanensis) is a species of Old World warbler in the family Phylloscopidae. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests and subtropical or tropical high-altitude shrubland. It is found only in China.

The Chinese leaf warbler’s scientific binomial name, Phylloscopus yunnanensis, originates from the Irish ornithological naturalist authority John David Digues La Touche in 1922. A more recent Latin ""junior synonym"" alternate scientific name is P. sichuanensis from 1992. Yunnanensis and sichuanensis derive from the Yunnan and Sichuan provinces in China.

The Chinese leaf warbler is a brightly colored, small leaf-warbler, with a total length of around 10 cm and a wing length of 5–6 cm. Its body is slightly elongated and compact. The warbler has a slightly forked or notched tail that is almost square in shape. Its bill is pointed and short (around 1 cm long) and dark brown in color, brownish-yellow on the underside. The wings are very short and rounded, the legs slender and very dark. Claws and toes are dark brownish-grey with dusky buff undersides.

Birds generally go through variations in the appearance of their plumage, depending on the stage in their life, the seasons or nutritional intake.  In the spring season, this warbler in its adult phase has a new, fresh, or bright appearance already somewhat dulled. In the adult summer phase its feathers appear worn, or duller.
The sexes are similar in appearance. The Chinese leaf warbler is pale green to olive-green above and has a yellowish-white rump. The head pattern is noticeable and striking in appearance, with a well-defined pale eyebrow stripe, a faint yellow median crown stripe and dusky-olive lateral crown stripes. The tertial feathers are sepia-colored and have whitish tips. The eye is surrounded by a broken eyering; the iris of the eye is dark brown.

The Chinese leaf warbler can be found in confined regions or locations in central and north-eastern China. It is common in Xin Shui, Sichuan Province. The species is migratory, but its wintering grounds are currently unknown.
It inhabits mountainous forests, preferring spruce and fir. It can be found at elevations of 200–2800 m, but usually between 1000 m and 2600 m. This species favors low secondary growth.

Chinese leaf warblers can be found singly or in pairs during the breeding season. These birds are generally somewhat bold in personality. They almost always keep to tree canopies, where they feed on insects. Males also sing from the tops of trees.

The Chinese leaf warbler has a unique song compared to other species of its genus. The song often lasts over a minute and is dry and monotonous tsiridi repeated five times. The call note is loud and varied, an irregular series of clear scolding whistles of tueet repeated five times, then four series of decreasing lengths, finishing up with another 5-fold note. The last phrase can be a hammering tueet-tuee-tee, with a seven-fold tee. The close-range call is a soft trr-trr.

Lesser jacana,"The lesser jacana (Microparra capensis) is a wader in the family Jacanidae and can be found in Africa. It can be recognized by its long legs and claws that allow it to walk on aquatic vegetation – although it is not to be confused with the larger African Jacana. The lesser jacana is insectivorous. Its conservation status is of least concern.
The name jacana is derived from a Tupi name of the bird, ñaha'nã.

The smallest species in the Jacanidae family, the lesser jacana is 15–16 cm tall and weighs 41g. It has a white breast, golden forehead, cinnamon crown, and dark eyestripe. Its mantle and wings are also darker. As other jacanas, they have long legs and claws which are adapted for walking on lily-pads and aquatic grasses – which is why jacanas are sometimes referred to as lily trotters or Jesus birds because they appear as though they are walking on the surface of the water.
Lesser jacana eggs resemble African jacana eggs but are smaller. African jacana juveniles closely resemble adult lesser jacanas, and the two may be confused as their range overlaps in Southern Africa.
In the field, lesser jacanas are reportedly more easily identifiable when flying as they may hide in aquatic vegetation. In flight, its legs appear long and trail behind its body. Its wings have a white trailing edge.
The lesser jacana has minimal sexual dimorphism, with males and females being nearly identical, although the female is on average 4% larger than the male. Males are reported to have darker backs than females.

The lesser jacana is one of eight species in the family Jacanidae. It is monotypic within the genus Microparra meaning it does not have any sub-species. Within the family Jacanidae, the lesser jacana is most closely related to the comb-crested jacana of Australia – these two species are considered to be of the same clade. The family Jacanidae is divided into two clades: 1) the comb-crested, lesser jacana, bronze-winged jacana, african jacana, and 2) pheasant-tailed jacana, wattled jacana, northern jacana.

The lesser jacana can be found in wetland habitats in Angola, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eswatini, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. They occupy the shorelines of permanent and seasonally flooded wetlands in Africa. They hang out in areas that are partially grown with sedge and grass. As new pools are filled with rainfall, lesser jacanas may move into these newly flooded habitats. They favor areas where sedge and grass cover is sparse, but more abundant as compared to water lilies. They use aquatic vegetation for cover and may be inconspicuous as a result.
Lesser jacanas range overlaps with that of the African Jacana, and these species often coexist.

As the lesser jacana trots across lily pads or climbs grass stems, it is able to forage insects from emergent vegetation. It has been observed to peck insects off surrounding vegetation, to search for insects by lifting submerged stems out of the water with its bill, and to swim for food at the water’s surface.

Lesser jacanas are unique in their mating. All other jacanas in the Jacanidae family display a polyandrous mating strategy. Sex roles are reversed in these other jacana species, as males perform parental care and females breed with multiple species. Females are resultantly slightly larger than males in these other jacanas. Observations of the lesser jacana show that they do not follow this mating strategy. Lesser jacanas practice biparental care where both parents cooperate in caring for their young. Unlike other jacana species where the male takes on the role of incubating the chicks by himself, the male and female of the lesser jacana are both involved in nest-building and incubate the eggs equally. The lesser jacana shows minimal sexual dimorphism as a result. They have been observed to be monogamous. To reproduce, the male mounts the females back and copulation averages 7 seconds – shorter than other jacana species due to lower levels of sperm competition.
The lesser jacana lays two or three tan-colored eggs with black markings in a floating nest. Their eggs are identical in appearance to eggs of the African Jacana, but are smaller. Eggs are incubated for 19–21 days. To incubate, males and females hold their eggs against their breast with the underside of their wing. Once hatched, parents brood their young under their wing. When chicks face an apparent danger, the parent collects its chick and carries it under its wing.

Lesser jacanas have been observed to make five distinct vocalizations. The first of these is a distress call that the lesser jacana will produce when its chicks are approached, a chatter that sounds like “hwi hwi hwi ….” The most common vocalization is a melodic, low-pitch “woot” produced by both sexes. It has also been observed vocalizing a peeving “see sree shrrr,” a soft “tchr tchr tchr,” and repeating a “ti” or “hli” sound. If a lesser jacana was observed to call, its mate was seen to make this same call in response or synchronously. Prior to copulation, males have been observed to vocalize a hoot-like call to lure females toward him.

Black-and-white snub-nosed monkey,"The black-and-white snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti), also known as the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey, is a large black and white primate that lives only in the southern Chinese province of Yunnan, where it is known to the locals as the Yunnan golden hair monkey (Chinese: 滇金丝猴) and the black-and-white snub-nosed monkey (黑白仰鼻猴). The common name, black snub-nosed monkey, is issued to Rhinopithecus strykeri, inhabiting the Northern Sino-Myanmar border. Coniferous and deciduous forests in the mountainous regions of Yunnan are the ideal terrain for these primates. It is threatened by habitat loss, and is considered an endangered species. With their unique adaptations to their environment, these monkeys thrive at extreme altitudes despite the below freezing temperatures and thin air. This primate's diet is mainly made up of the large amounts of lichens available in their region.

Male and female black-and-white snub-nosed monkeys have no colorization differences, but do differ in sizes. Females weigh 20 lbs, while males are around 30 lbs. Adult black-and-white snub-nosed monkeys are identifiable by their gray/black and white fur. The underbelly and central facial zone are all white, while the rest of the body is a grayish black color. Their fur is extremely thick to protect them against below freezing temperatures. They are born with white fur that darkens with age. Another distinctive feature shared by both adults and babies, is their hairless and vibrant pink lips. These primates get the ""snub-nosed"" part of their name from the absence of nasal bones. This is considered their most distinctive feature.

Unlike many primates, the black-and-white snub-nosed monkey's diet consists mainly of lichen found on trees. Lichens grow in abundance in mountainous regions, and make for a reliable, year-round food supply. These primates will also eat bamboo leaves and other, more seasonal plants if the opportunity presents itself. Many food items vary depending on the geographical location of each troop including rhododendron flower's nectar in the spring. Lichens are toxic to most animals, but the black-and-white snub-nosed monkey has specialized digestive enzymes similar to those of a cow that remove the harmful bacteria.

The reproduction cycles of black-and-white snub-nosed monkeys are generally similar to those of golden snub-nosed monkeys, except the time of birth is often two to three months later due to a colder climate. Like most primates, the snub-nosed monkey gives birth at night, making it difficult for researchers to observe. A rare observation of a daytime birth found a multiparous female assisting another female in the birthing process, similar to human midwifery practice.

The black-and-white snub-nosed monkey lives at the highest altitude of any known non-human primate. The highest recorded altitude of a group of this species is 4700 m. Surviving in such extreme conditions is only made possible by a mutation in the primate's genomic DNA sequence that allows increased resistance to oxygen deprivation (hypoxia). Other mutations in the DNA sequence have been found to be harmful to the monkeys, as there is evidence of inbreeding and low genetic diversity among populations.

This species has a highly restricted distribution in the bio-diverse Nujiang Langcang Gorge alpine conifer and mixed forests of the Yun Range, which is part of the greater Hengduan Mountains. Only 17 groups with a total population of less than 1,700 animals survive in northwest Yunnan and neighboring regions in the Autonomous Prefecture of Tibet. The territory of each group varies from 20 to 135 square km. Deciduous and coniferous forests are their preferred habitat, where lichen grows in abundance year-round.

The black-and-white snub-nosed monkey was almost completely unknown until the 1990s. The fact that no zoo outside of China has ever kept the black-and-white snub-nosed monkey in captivity has contributed to the enigmatic status of this species.

Stump-tailed macaque,"The stump-tailed macaque (Macaca arctoides), also called the bear macaque, is a species of macaque native to South Asia and Southeast Asia. In India, it occurs south of the Brahmaputra River, in the northeastern part of the country. Its range in India extends from Assam and Meghalaya to eastern Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura.
It is primarily frugivorous, but eats many types of vegetation, such as seeds, leaves and roots, but also hunts freshwater crabs, frogs, bird eggs and insects.

The stump-tailed macaque has long, thick, dark brown fur covering its body, but its face and its short tail, which measures between 32 and 69 mm (1.3 and 2.7 in), are hairless. Infants are born white and darken as they mature. As they age, their bright pink or red faces darken to brown or nearly black and lose most of their hair. Males are larger than females, measuring 51.7–65 cm (20.4–25.6 in) long and weighing 9.7–10.2 kg (21–22 lb), while females measure 48.5–58.5 cm (19.1–23.0 in) and weigh 7.5–9.1 kg (17–20 lb). Males' canine teeth, which are important for establishing dominance within social groups, are more elongated than those of the females. Like all macaques, this species has cheek pouches to store food for short periods of time.

This Old World monkey travels quadrupedally, usually on the ground, as it is not very agile in trees. It is generally found in evergreen tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests, at different elevations depending on the amount of rainfall in the area. It depends on rainforests for food and shelter, and is not found in dry forests except where it ranges in the Himalayan region of India, only spending time in secondary forests if it is bordering old-growth forest tropical forests. With its thick fur, the stump-tailed macaque can live in cold climates at elevations up to 4,000 m (13,000 ft). It is distributed from northeastern India and southern China into the northwest tip of West Malaysia on the Malay Peninsula. It is also found in Burma, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. It is possibly extinct in Bangladesh. No global population estimate is available. In Cambodia, a declining population of 230 is reported from Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary.

A study population was introduced to Tanaxpillo, an uninhabited island in Lake Catemaco, Veracruz, Mexico in 1974, where it ranges in seminatural conditions. Most information on the species comes from the introduced population on Tanaxpillo and other captive settings, as few long-term studies have been conducted on the stump-tailed macaque in the wild.

Stump-tailed macaque generally share the same social structure of any macaque species with a linear dominance hierarchy that is rigid and hereditary in females yet fluctuates among males based on their fighting ability and social maneuvering, but what makes stump-tail macaques truly unique is their ability to defuse intense confrontations and maintain a high degree of pacifism and harmony in their troop, thanks to their surprisingly rich repertoire of reconciliation tactics. This species has no lasting pair bonds and is truly promiscuous, a staple for macaques. Physical violence very rarely occurs, and although minor scraps often flair up and physical intimidation displays occur, they tend to quickly be resolved, resulting in this species being labelled as peaceful. Stump-tailed macaques are remarkably unfussy in their eating habits though fruit generally is a staple part of their diet. Stump-tail macaques have a large, bulky, muscular build with thick, solid limbs, making them very mobile on land yet quite ungainly in trees, and this unusual physique for a macaque may be responsible for this species unique tendency to consume larger quantities of meat than other macaque species. Stump-tail macaques feed on very large quantities of insects, small animals and eggs.

A study population of female stump-tailed macaques was found to have increased levels of steroid sex hormones, specifically 17β-estradiol and progesterone levels. 17β-estradiol levels were significantly greater during summer and fall and progesterone levels were significantly greater during summer, fall and winter. This explains how stump-tailed macaques have two mating seasons per year: one in summer (July–August) and one in fall (November). This is supported by the distribution of birth frequency in stump-tailed macaques.

Naja romani,"Naja romani is an extinct species of cobra from the Miocene of Europe. Its remains have been found from France to Russia and suggest a continued growth to larger sizes throughout its range in time. While successful during the early and middle stages of the Miocene, the species disappeared from the fossil record of Central Europe during the late Miocene with the last known specimen being recovered from a site in the modern Caucasus, inferred to have been a refuge for reptiles. Estimates suggest that Naja romani may have reached a length of over 2 m (6 ft 7 in).

Naja romani was first described by Hofstetter in the year 1939 on the basis of several cranial and postcranial remains from La Grive-Saint Alban in France. Hofstetter coined the name Palaeonaja romani as well as Palaeonaja crassa. Later Szyndlar & Rage sunk Palaeonaja into the extant Naja while determining that P. crassa does not differ significantly enough to be considered a distinct species. Additional instances of Naja romani were later reported from various localities across Europe. Fossils from Austria had previously been considered to be their own species, Naja austriaca, but were later deemed to be indistinguishable from those of Naja romani. The most recent find assigned to the species was collected in 2009 in the Caucasus and formed the youngest record of Naja romani.
The species was named in honor of French geologist Frédéric Roman.

The type specimen of Naja romani was determined to have reached a length of 1.80 m (5 ft 11 in) by Hoffstetter. Hoffstetter also estimated a length of over 2 m (6 ft 7 in) for the larger remains he named Naja crassa, which were later found to also belong to Naja romani. An even greater size is indicated by the youngest remains assigned to the species, however no precise estimates are given.

Within Naja two distinct lineages can be observed, an Asian lineage as well as an African lineage (which is further divided into Afronaja, Boulengerina and Uraeus). Both groups can be distinguished by the anatomy of the basisphenoid, which is distinctly narrower before the basipterygoid crest, has shorter vidian canals and anterior orifices on the ventral rather than the dorsal surface. These characteristics are shared by Naja romani, clearly placing it in the Asian branch of the genus. A second character that would allow assignment to one of the two branches would be the location of the vestibular window. However this is only possible in the French specimens, which support the identification of Naja romani as a member of the Asian lineage. Szyndlar and Zerova conclude that the species was likely an early member of the Asian group, but certainly diverged from the other species after the Asian-African split.

The oldest recorded specimens of Naja romani date to the Burdigalian (MN 4) and were discovered in Petersbuch, Germany, with similarly aged remains tentatively referred to the taxon also being found in Echzell (Germany, MN 4) and Vieux-Collonges (France, MN 4/5). By the middle and late Miocene Naja romani could also be found in Grund (Austria, MN 5), La Grive-Saint Alban (France, MN 7+8), Gritsev and Rudabánya (Ukraine and Hungary, MN 9), Ravin de la Pluie (Greece, MN 10) and Kohfidisch (Austria, MN11). Ongoing climate change however likely lead to the extinction of cobras in central Europe by the latest Miocene, with the specimens from Kohfidisch being the last known remains of the species from the region. Cobras did however manage to survive in other regions of Europe and the last known records of Naja romani were found in Solnechnodolsk in the northern Caucasus in strata dating to the late Turolian (MN 13). Notably however, despite being known to preserve a rich and diverse reptile fauna, only a single bone of Naja romani is known from the region, indicating that the species was already declining in this part of the world as well.
This pattern of distribution and disappearance matches the climatic changes that occurred in Europe during the Miocene around the same time as the Messinian Salinity Crisis. Although temperatures remained favorable during the latest stages of the Miocene, the snake fauna of the continent is known to have experienced a loss of diversity. In central Europe in particular temperatures began to drop during the Middle Miocene, causing the formation of distinct climate zones faced with regional extinctions that restricted certain snakes to the warmer regions of western Europe (France and Spain) and southern Europe (Greece and Turkey). The locality in Solnechnodolsk was likely a refugium not just for Naja romani but also for other species of reptiles that had gone extinct elsewhere in Europe. Younger remains of cobras, which are known from the Pliocene of Spain, have been shown to be unrelated to Naja romani and instead are thought to be members of the African-lineage that likely entered Europe following the drying of the Mediterranean.
It has been suggested by Syromyatnikova, Tesakov & Titov that Naja romani grew larger as the Miocene progressed, with specimens from Petersbuch and Vieux-Collonges being generally smaller than younger fossils, which reached their greatest size with those found in Kohfidisch and Solnechnodolski. The exact ecology of Naja romani is not known, though the species is thought to be thermophilous like most other Asian Naja species with the exception of the Caspian cobra. Based on the presence of Naja romani as well as that of monitor lizards, a mean annual temperature of 15°C or more is estimated for the Solnechnodosk locality, suggesting subtropical conditions.

In a 2017 publication, Pokrant and colleagues note that in rare cases, modern grass snakes and Iberian grass snakes display defensive behavior similar to that of cobras, raising their upper body and flattening it in a way that resembles a cobra's hood. They note that this behavior is not found in other European snakes while further pointing to the fact that there is no significant overlap in grass snake and cobra ranges. The only areas where the two coexist in the modern day are small regions in Tunisia and east of the Caspian Sea in Iran and Turkmenistan. Pokrant and his team argue that this form of mimicry could have developed during the Neogene when Natrix longivertebrata, thought to be the direct ancestor to both modern grass snake species, coexisted in multiple localities with Naja romani and may have imitated the cobra to scare off predators. As this form of mimicry is only effective when the predator is aware of the model species, rearing behavior would have become increasingly ineffective following the extinction of cobras in Central Europe. Pokrant and colleagues argue that the rareness of rearing behavior in grass snakes might indicate that the species are currently in the process of losing this behavior, tho it may still be effective against migratory birds that encounter cobras on their travels."
