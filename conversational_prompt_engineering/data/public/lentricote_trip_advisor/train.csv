Let's start with the two bad things - you (nearly always) have to queue for up to 20-30 minutes at peak times (lunch is better in this regard), and the staff are often on the rude side (they have little incentive not to be, with a fixed service charge and a perennially packed restaurant). But, this restaurant in a London favourite. The sliced steak and ""secret sauce"", with fries, served in two sittings, is just phenomenally delicious. The bread and salad you get as a starter is great too. And the range of puddings are impressive and all that I have tried delicious. I would eat at this restaurant weekly for the rest of my life, happily.""The wait on a cold October Saturday was quick and there were outdoor heaters to take the edge off the chill. The food came quickly and was delicious. It's a shame they wouldn't tell us was was in their special and famous sauce. I did think that a restaurant billed as a Marylebone institution should have had slightly friendlier staff with better communication skills. They were stony faced Europeans with haste in their bearings. Our waitress stammered over her words and while topping-up our steak and fries. Having said that, the top-up was very welcome indeed!""Eating here is a wonderful experience; it is an authentic French restaurant right in the middle of London. For entreés, they only serve steak, fries, salad, and bread. Everything is delicious; the steak is cooked exactly right and the accompanying sauce is exquisite. The fries are perfect, remaining crisp throughout the meal. And the salad is flavorful with a bit of tang; the bread is delicious with the salad. The surprise for me was, when I was thinking I wish there were a little more meat, they hold back about a quarter of the meat until the first serving is almost completed, and then bring out the rest, hot and cooked as requested, with more fries. The house wine complemented the meal wonderfully. I had the chocolate tower dessert; it was three layers of meringue combined with two layers of ice cream, topped with whipped cream, and all covered with chocolate sauce. Decadent. And delicious. The servers were busy and efficient, but all of them took the time to explain things to me and all were happy to pose for photos. And I had a pleasant conversation with the hostess, afterwards. Don't be put off by the French reputation for brusqueness; this isn't France and they're quite amiable here.""I went here with some people from work. All I can say is WOW. They only serve steak and chips; the most beautiful food ever. I have been to lots of steak places but this is on another level. I am constantly planning on when I will be going back!! The sauce they serve over the steak is beautiful too! It's £25 always you get a salad to start, then you get a small plate of steak and chips and then they come around with another set of steak and chips. We bought the house wine which is red only was only £17 something for central Marylebone! This is amazing. Anyone who has never been seriously missing out!!!!!"
