I called a few years later to unfreeze my credit report for a mortgage. I had to verify my identity to do this. That is fine I am all for being extra cautious. The address I currently live at wasnt updated on equifaxs end. They locked me out of my online account as well. Thats very annoying but fine in the name of security. I to fax in my driver license and send in a cable bill to prove my identity. Also very annoying but fine again. I called as well and they grilled me on my credit history. All answers answered correctly and they assured me my credit was unfrozen and that my account with them online would be working. They said it would take about an hour to be activated. I check back in an hour and nothing is working. So I called back and they said the system is updating so call back. I have called and called and they keep coming up with many excuses to keep from having to deal with this issue. Im not sure what is going over there but after I have proven my identity I feel like they are just preventing me from getting my credit unfrozen unjustly. This has been going on for a few months now.

Further, I am unable to secure these accounts because they ask for the very personal information that is breached in order to verify my identity and approve a change.  Equifax is currently offering a limited credit monitoring service, which does n't even activate immediately.

"I 've been a victim of identity theft in the past. I am still recovering from this and have spent thousands to restore my good credit and my good name.   Meanwhile, Equifax, a company which has refused to entertain some of my identity theft claims in the past, now, in an egregious act of fiscal irresponsibility, allowed my identity to be stolen AGAIN.   You ca n't stand against these credit bureaus. They have all the means at their disposal, and they did NOTHING to  safeguard the security of the accounts of millions. Sure. They 're offering a "" free '' credit protection as some sort of malarkey recompense, but how reliable is that when it 's being run by the same organization that allowed the private information of millions of customers around the globe to be compromised in the first place?

They can even impact your ability to get a job that pays a decent enough wage to have a debt-free life someday! The fact that they have so much responsibility, and were so careless with it, is an egregious breach of consumer protection justice.   Equifax needs to hang up its hat, stop messing with the lives of millions of Americans, issue more than a stupid apology and an enrollment in a free "" protection ' company run by the same folks who let our identities be stolen in the first place, and stop ruining the lives of millions with their capricious judgments based on nothing but the whims of greedy bankers.

"XXXX  and Equifax continue to allow XXXX  XXXX  to report incorrect and inaccurate information to their bureau stating I owe the {$1400.00} for car payments. I sent XXXX  and Equifax both a letter from the company itself as documented proof that XXXX XXXX closed this account in XX/XX/XXXX and that there was a XXXX balance owing and that the lien account was paid in full. This account was a car loan that was cancelled due to a repurchase by the manufacturer XXXX for an acceleration defect on the car, in which the dealership was not able to fix. This car was repurchased back under the California lemon law and I was due to be refunded back everything I paid towards the car : my down payment and the car notes. The amounts of {$1400.00} are not the amount for the two car payments I paid. The Car payments came to the amount of XXXX each for a sum of {$1200.00} ; so that also is an inaccuracy as far as these two bureaus reporting. I have sent in the proof attached to show that this account was closed and paid in full and the break down from XXXX XXXX as to what was credited and what was due to be refunded to me. XXXX XXXX was not supposed to keep the car payments ; I repeat, they were to be refunded to me. Ive been disputing this issue since XX/XX/XXXX and this company continues to report these inaccuracies. I never received the refund of the money I paid toward the car, and XXXX XXXX as well as, the dealership were refusing to accept my calls, therefore, I went through my bank to get my money back after providing the bank the same proof from the company, my bank deemed it enough evidence that there was in deed a refund owed to me by XXXX XXXX and the Dealership. Both XXXX  and Equifax continue to allow XXXX XXXX to report every month and tell me that as long as they are reporting every month, the account will show up on my credit reports. However, both XXXX  and Equifax still are ignoring that the information XXXX XXXX is reporting is incorrect and again not accurate with regards to this account is supposed to be closed and the amount they are reporting for the two payments they say I owe, doesnt equal the amount of the two payments I paid.

The attached documents are from XXXX XXXX ; I am no longer responsible for this account because it was a repurchase by XXXX.

I have filed a complaint with all credit bureaus regarding Santander USA including the cfpb. I have requested documentation stating that the Santander account was actually charged off and that proper Fair Credit Reporting rules were followed and I can not receive that information from the credit bureaus or Santander. Santander did not provide any of this information to the credit bureaus as well. I have had no way to dispute the statements made by Santander through any of the credit bureaus and I am just supposed to take the information given as is with no recourse. Santander also has evidence including verbal confirmation that is on a recorded line that they took for payments and put it at the end of my loan. Why would they put my loan in charge off status when I am still paying it? Why would they be allowed it to not have to notified me of charged-off debt is or provide me any documentation I requested regarding it? They provided none of this information to any of the credit bureaus and I have disputed this multiple times with the credit bureaus we have not thoroughly investigated these things or allowed me to dispute them. The CFPB has done a poor job at holding people accountable just as the credit bureaus have also done a poor job at holding people accountable. Santander USA needs to provide information I'm asking for and I have repeatedly asked for over the last two years. It needs to happen immediately. I want the four payments that were put at the end of the loan I'm very specific dates documented to all agencies. I want all documented evidence of letters sent to me that they followed fair credit reporting practices and notified me in writing by providing me copies of the letters. I have requested all of this information multiple times in writing and verbally and it is all documented. They illegally charged off my account. They are not following Fair Credit Reporting.

The credit report does not show credit scores, so that is not an effective solution. XXXX allowed me to purchase my score but there way to provide score history to reflect the drop on their site. The loan should be listed as a transfer since XXXX did not renew their contracts with the U.S. Department of Education causing the loan to be transferred.

"REQUEST FOR FREE ANNUAL CREDIT REPORT!!!  I believe that each consumer reporting agency has invalidated the true spirit of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. The Act first established XX/XX/2003 was intended to establish a plan whereas common American citizens could obtain a copy of their credit reports at least once a year free of charge. Since each credit reporting agency now has marketing divisions such as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX  and XXXX  XXXX, the automation system to obtain the free annual reports is looped into an information request to steer citizens into additional product offers that are excessive and unnecessary. Even though I may have received an approval of an updated credit report from either XXXX, XXXX XXXX or Equifax respectively, it is unfair that I need to do a mail request since I can submit my personal information through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) portal. I believe that since the CFPB is the sole responsible oversight party of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, its imperative that any additional solicitation of information from the credit bureaus should be blocked permanently. I along with any other citizen should receive a free credit report upon request. The credit reporting agencies are an important aspect of the national banking system to properly function, but the current aggressive marketing campaign soliciting citizens for an arbitrary FICO score has gone too far, including but not limited to XXXX  XXXX.

"Hello, I have mailed certified letters to Equifax, faxed requested information on multiple occasions, and filed online disputes in the last three months in an effort to contest inaccurate information on my credit report with Equifax. Equifax is claiming that I do not have any credit history with them. I found this out by attempting to unfreeze my credit report this year in XXXX with them which I initially froze on XXXX/XXXXXXXX2017. I was advised to initially put this freeze/temporary fraud alert on due to the Equifax data breach. First the data breach, now the protection from the data breach is doing more harm than help. It seems that I have just disappeared from their database without any explanation. In my letter I explained to them that I needed this request expedited because Im in the process of applying for a home mortgage which requires a Tri-Merge credit report from all three credit bureaus, and they will not allow me to proceed without my Equifax report. My request were met with multiple phone long calls where I was transferred around in circles to multiple departments, and never once did anyone resolve my issue. They continued to request the same information which I had already sent, and the end result was always the same. I believe their has been a database error on their part, and no solution has been provided. Im getting concerned that they have mixed up my name and SSN # with someone else. Im at my wits end with Equifax, and I do not know what to do next because Ive been trying for months to remove the fraud alert, and they are saying I do not have a profile with them which is bogus. I have lost out on expediting my mortgage process, and Im still in limbo with the lending company Im working with due to Equifax.

"I am requesting to file a complaint against Kia Motors Finance for incorrectly reporting my account as a charge off. I was involved in a car accident in XX/XX/2019, ( which I may include my air bags did not go off ). Following the accident, I received a balance of {$1500.00} in XX/XX/2019, that was still owed for my deductible and miscellaneous issues ( low tire tread, etc ), even though my car was considered a total loss. I did not have {$1500.00} to pay Kia up front, so I contacted them and was told by a representative of Kia, that I would need to pay {$250.00} a month until it was paid off. ( All calls are recorded, which I also requested to pull and listen to ). I had zero issue with that and I agreed to this {$250.00} per month payment and made payments monthly until I paid it completely off on XX/XX/2019.  XX/XX/2019, I received an alert from the Credit Bureau that I had a negative remark on my account. After reviewing the remark and my severally dropped credit score, I noticed Kia had reported my account paid charge off. I was completely shocked considering I made the payments requested every single month. I contacted the Credit Bureau immediately, XXXX, to dispute this remark. I also took time out to write Kia my own dispute via mail on XX/XX/2019, stating that I never have been late on any payment with them, or ANY payments in almost 6 years of credit history. I attached all of the information located on my credit report for XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX as reported ON TIME. They did not report any months as late. Also, the summary of my Kia account stated zero late payments. I requested that Kia report my account as paid off, closed. On XX/XX/2019, I contacted XXXX to get the results of my dispute and was told that Kia stated my account was reported correctly as charge off. On XX/XX/2019, I was alerted of yet another remark of a late payment on my credit report for XX/XX/2019. Kia went back on my credit report and change my ON TIME payment to LATE! I can not believe they changed it, to cover themselves.  Charge offs typically dont happen unless payments are severely late. When you start missing payments, creditors first send letters reminding you of your past-due bill. I never received a past due bill and my account was never sent to collections.  This charge off remark dropped my credit score from a 750+ to XXXX. I have never had derogatory remark on my credit score and always have made my payments on time. Kia is dramatically hurting my credit now and my future. Especially of being a home buyer by inaccurately reporting information incorrectly.

"Re : XXXX Customer Service Center I renewed my XXXX Lease ( traded in XXXX XXXX XXXX  for a XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX ).

I then went and made sure that it was again set up for autopay later in XXXX.

I have a late payment showing on my account because I attempted to pay it online repeatedly and I kept getting kicked off the site because of technical issues. I attempted to make my payment by using my phone and a computer and it locked me out. I then tried calling but was on hold forever and I had to go. By the time I had time to make the payment the payment was late even though I emailed the company to assist me. They also never called or sent me a bill in the mail so I had no other way of paying it. I have tried repeatedly to have the company remove the late pay history since its effecting my score and wasnt really my fault its just a difficult website. I have also contacted the credit bureaus but have not gotten the results i had hoped for there either. Please assist me in helping get this removed as it was not my fault.

Your failure to delete the disputed accounts that you cant verify after two written requests is also evidence of your willful disregard of Federal Law.  When we go to litigation and through the discovery process you will be required to produce these documents along with an affidavit swearing under oath that these are the true and correct documents that you used to verify the disputed accounts. The fact that you dont have any of the said documents in your files is proof that you did not properly verify the accounts within 30 days as required by law and the Court will order you to delete them.  You say that you have reinvestigated these accounts but youve admitted that all you have done is parroted information given to you by other sources and shifted the burden back to me to contact the original creditor to verify these accounts which is clearly in violation of 1681 ( a ) ( 4 ).  I also asked you to give me the name of the person in your company who verified the accuracy of these accounts but you ignored this request as well which is another violation of Federal Law and evidence of your willful disregard of the law.

"I have been corresponding back and forth with XXXX and now XXXX for the past year regarding the late payments they are reporting on my account with the credit reporting agencies ( Equifax, XXXX and XXXX XXXX ).  XXXX is reporting two 60 day late payments on two separate accounts! Not 30 days, but 60! I  have asked for explanation and proof that these payments were billed as payments due and not received. I am not accustomed to NOT payment my bills. They responded by providing the attached statements for both accounts. Neither of the statements show when a payment was actually due or the amount that is due. They do show when I made payments and how much was accepted and posted to interest. It also has a column for Late Charge paid, but no amount is ever listed in that column, even when payments were made.   My argument is that the accounts have been in forbearance for pretty much the life of the loans, so any payments that I have made has been only when interest payments are arranged, which I get emails when payments are due and I pay them, as you will also see on the statements. There is no indication on the statements that payments were due in XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX. You will also see attached, a statement from XXXX notifying me that both loans was back in forbearance beginning on XX/XX/XXXX.

I have been disputing 3 accounts with equifax since XX/XX/XXXX XXXX equifax had deleted 1 of the accounts in regards to that dispute but NEVER sent me written results on the deletion on the remaining 2 accounts. XX/XX/2022 I sent equifax another letter specifying why were the remaining two accounts not investigated. I have not heard any correspondence nor have gotten results in regards to that dispute. it is now XXXX XXXX XXXX and I checked for a update on there website and I noticed both accounts still have not been investigated due to lack off notice of a investigation completion or a investigation in progress notice from equifax in the comments section on both accounts. I believe equifax is practicing non compliance procedures and illegal practices. it is not fair that I have to wait all this time by giving them there respectfully business days to complete there thorough investigation just to confirm that they had not done a investigation to begin with. equifax procedures are causing my credit file much damages because it is defaming my character to gain new credit line opportunities. equifax never sent me written results nor all legal disclosures that should be attached to there results.,['credit reporting or credit repair services or other personal consumer reports']

I went to their website on XX/XX/XXXX to make the payment and their system would not allow me to make just the XXXX payment, it required me to make XXXX & XXXX.

The next morning, XX/XX/XXXX, I called them to see if I can adjust the payment to just XXXX payment and pay XXXX at a later date. The representative on the phone advised me to cancel the entire payment and he would then transfer me to someone else to re-do the payment to just cover XXXX. I was very concerned that if I cancelled, they would report it late on my credit report but the agent reassured me that they would not report it late. I agreed to cancel and he transferred me to make the single payment. When I tried to make the payment with the next agent, she told me that they no longer had my loan and it was transferred to another lender and I was unable to make the XXXX payment with them. When I called the new lender, they advised me that it would take at least 10 days to see the loan in their system and told me to call back then to make the payment. Now Homebridge reported me late for the XXXX payment and I am requesting they remove that late payment from my XXXX credit report. The Homebridge agent gave me incorrect information.

My employer was nice enough to reimburse me because we were hacked and that's how my personal card was compromised. The issue was that BoA counted the time of the open investigation as late payments when the person at their local branch AND ON THE PHONE said, that wouldn't count against my credit score. They refused to remove the late payments that show on my credit score because I the fee was not waived and if the fee is not waived, the late payment counts against me, which is something they never displayed to me and as a matter of fact they told me the opposite.

The only result of those complaints is the reduction of more than 50 point on my score. My point is even if such process was initiated, is not relevant nor accurate, because it is NOT the CURRENT situation. We want to rectify it because it does not mention the Short Sale agreement which supersedes any eventual past processes, like all the years we paid on time, or our atempts to get a fair modification, or this one that we never get notice of. Instead of that we get a letter offering th AVOID foreclosure more than three months AFTER we closed the account. An accurate report should show the CURRENT STATUS which is something like : "" Paid as agreed in a short sale process ''. As opposed to that in the Equifax report the "" STATUS '' column says "" 120+ days past due ''. That is definitely false and harmful, and has to be corrected.

As per the FCRA 15 USC 1681, a credit reporting agency can be sued for negligent or willful compliance with the law within two years after discovering harmful behavior, or within five years if the harmful behavior occurred. Furthermore, the FDCPA prohibits debt collectors from using false, misleading, or deceptive practices when collecting a debt.   I am requesting that Equifax contact the United States bankruptcy court to verify the accuracy of the information being reported. I also request the following information to support your Metro 2 compliance for consumer and commercial credit reporting : -A copy of your written policies and procedures for Metro 2 compliance in consumer and commercial credit reporting.  -Information on how your company obtains and verifies the accuracy of consumer and commercial credit information, and how it ensures that information is reported in accordance with Metro 2 guidelines.  -Details on any training or education provided to your employees regarding Metro 2 compliance in consumer and commercial credit reporting.  -Information on the systems and technology used by your company to report consumer and commercial credit information in Metro 2 format.  -Details on whether your company has undergone any audits or assessments of its Metro 2 compliance practices, and if so, request copies of the reports or findings.  I would also like to remind Equifax of their duty to report accurate information and not engage in any practices that may be considered defamation of character or misrepresentation of creditworthiness. Any such actions may result in potential legal action.  Finally, I would like to request information on the United States Bankruptcy Court 's role as a credit reporting agency and how they obtained and transferred the information being reported.

"I shared a lease for my wife at the times XXXX XXXX. In XXXX of 2020, during the COVID lockdown, we had both been furloughed from our jobs and were unable to make payments on the car during that time. Before we were late with a payment, she called Nissan to ask if they would be willing to pause our payments until we were able to pay again. They agreed and had done it with many customers already. We were grateful. In XXXX of 2020 ( do not remember the exact day ), I had just been able to get back to doing some work and received multiple calls from Nissan that informed me that we were late on our payments. I asked my wife to call them and ask if there was a problem. She called and the Nissan representative told her they were automated calls about being late and to ignore them as we had paused our payments only about a month earlier. I continued to receive these automated calls over the following weeks so I called Nissan personally to ask them to stop calling. At this point the representative informed me that the payment pause was only for one month and if we wanted to extend it we would have needed to call in again. This was absolutely not made clear at the time of the pause. and then on top of that, we were told to ignore the late payment calls. How are we supposed to know if a Nissan representative is telling us accurate information or not? We made the mistake of assuming they were giving us credible information and we ended up being hit with a 30 day late note on our reports. I had never over many years with NMAC been late with a payment. And as soon as I called and spoke with the representative, I paid the entire back balance ( two months ) along with the remainder of the lease ( ended up totaling about 4 months of payments ) immediately on the phone with him. I then wrote Nissan explaining this situation and they told me they would not correct it. This is deceptive and during a time like COVID lockdown where people needed help, Nissan offered help and then punished us for accepting it.

In XXXX a lien on my home was placed for the amount owed to Synchrony Bank for {$1200.00}. In order to pay off what I owed I had to take out a personal loan for the full amount. I paid the entire amount owed on this debt vs. settling on a lower amount. My problem is that I was told that Synchrony would remove this completely from my Credit Report - especially since I paid it in full. There was No Monies Charged Off or not collected owed on the original debt. I believe XXXX had removed the negative information ; however XXXX XXXX and XXXX continue to report negative information. Regardless that it says I dont owe anything its still being reported as In Collections/Charge Off and Payment Made After Charge Off which makes a potential creditor think Synchrony wrote off bad debt when they didnt. I paid the full amount which is why they need to remove this negative mark on my credit. Also if you look at my credit no matter how I pay on time each month my credit score remains low which gives creditors the right to charge higher interest rates. This is unfair and gouging - setting a consumer up for failure. Extending credit is the chance to pay off over time why must the consumer be gouged by higher interest when they need to continue to maintain a good score. Someone needs to re consider how a consumer whose paying on time the best they can. To say if you paid more each month goes against the agreed minimum amount. At this time Im doing everything I can to rebuild my credit from XXXX after job losses, and its almost futile the way Creditors and the Reporting Bureaus treat consumers who have limited incomes but still make their payments on time after suffering hardships.",['credit reporting or credit repair services or other personal consumer reports']

In fact, I to date still have not seen a bill for the service. This seems to be a clear example of debt "" parking '' on behalf of XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX Hospital. XXXX said if I would pay the bill over the phone and then dispute the issue with the credit reporting agency that they would confirm that they had sent the bill to the incorrect address.  I paid the amount owed over the phone ( despite still not having received a bill ), and filed disputes with all three major reporting agencies. I have since received results that they have simply updated my report to show that the amount was paid in full, but the collection activity remains. I've been able to make contact on the phone with at least one agency ( XXXX ) who confirmed that they did not actually investigate my claim that I never received a bill, but instead brought the dispute to conclusion when they saw the amount was paid in full. It is clear that this must be the case with the other two as well.  For the record, I do not believe that I had ever been to XXXX XXXX XXXX Hospital ever before the visit at the end of XXXX. I recall filling out several forms that included my current address. I had been a patient at XXXX XXXX Hospital XXXX in the XXXX time frame, and assume that the billing department at XXXX simply used the old address that was in the system for my years earlier visit to XXXX Hospital XXXX rather than the updated address information that I provided to the receptionist in XXXX on my visit to XXXX XXXX   Hospital.

Once I began the dispute process PRA sent a printout of an old statement from both accounts. The copies of the original statements showed that they were originally addressed to 2 different addresses, both of which belonged to my father. My father and I share the same name with no differentiating title, i.e. junior, senior, etc. I sent a letter to the 3 bureaus and PRA requesting more information/proof that the accounts were mine. I have received no such proof from either PRA or the 3 credit bureaus. I keep receiving the same form letter from PRA that lists name, account number, date account was opened, balance, etc. The ONLY original information I have ever received is one copy of a credit card statement from both accounts which both list addresses that belonged to my father. I believe that PRA and the three credit reporting bureaus have NOT performed a proper investigation, even after being requested to do so, and continue to use the XXXX system in order to "" validate '' the accounts.

"On XX/XX/2018 I mailed the credit bureau a letter requesting them to remove dismissed & unconfirmed bankruptcies from my credit report. I stated that I was outraged that their company continues to maintain multiple dismissed ( filed ) bankruptcies as confirmed on my credit report. These unconfirmed, unverified, and dismissed ( filed ) bankruptcies have stopped me from obtaining credit. I know for a fact these companies receive information on bankruptcy from a third party system known as a Pacer System. The Pacer System is inaccurate and incomplete since the Pacer System does not provide complete social security numbers as that would be against the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Privacy Laws. Furthermore, I have been in contact with the county courthouse and they also assured me they do not report full social security numbers to thirty parties or make social security numbers public record. Even though it the credit bureaus policy to keep reporting a bankruptcy that is filed, dismissed, or adjudicated for 10 years, the Fair Credit Reporting Act mentions nothing in Section 1681 ( c ) relating to bankruptcy about dismissals or filings. The law is very clear and states from date of adjudication or date of order of relief.  Any case, whether it be civil or otherwise, once dismissed it no longer exists in the eyes of the law. This case filed may never have actually been adjudicated. They have no right to maintain information which the government has deemed non-existent. It is only fair that in accordance with section 1618 ( a ) ( 5 ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act they delete this from my credit report and send me an updated copy.  Considering this does not require an investigation, I would appreciated an updated copy of my credit report showing no bankruptcy within two weeks from the date you receive this.",['credit reporting or credit repair services or other personal consumer reports']

"In the summer of XXXX, hackers accessed Equifax 's system and compromised the personal credit information of over 100 million users.

I am one of the victims of this breach. Equifax 's offer of one year of credit monitoring is a mere token of whats necessary to protect myslef.

Based on this breach, I do not believe any bank, other financial institution or business can safely rely on the reports that Equifax might produce in the future. Simply, Equifax can no longer be trusted.   I further demand that Equifax provide a lifetime of credit monitoring for me and any other consumer who is likewise affected by the negligence of Equifax.

Section 611 ( a ) of the FCRA, which requires credit reporting agencies to investigate and correct any inaccurate information in a consumer 's credit report, and to notify the consumer of the results of the investigation within a reasonable time period.  Section 312 of the FACTA, which amends the FCRA to require data furnishers to establish and maintain reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information they provide to credit reporting agencies, and to correct any inaccuracies upon notice from a credit reporting agency or a consumer.  Section 312 ( c ) of the FACTA, which provides immunity from liability for data furnishers that comply with reasonable procedures for accuracy and completeness of information.  Section 312 ( d ) of the FACTA, which authorizes the FTC to promulgate guidelines and regulations regarding the accuracy and completeness of credit information.

"Good evening, and how are you? This is going on for almost 90 days and i haven't received any responses from my previous disputes about this Credit Acceptance. This account was actually deleted or removed from XXXX  and XXXX due to several violations on reporting but XXXX  continues to ignore my request for deletion. It's illegally re-aging my account because it's reporting incomplete, unverifiable, and inaccurate information. There is no way that this could've been verified or looked into.

However, I continue to received a pre-template letter sent to me that its been verified and it REMAINS. How is it possible that this was verified if you continue to report incomplete, inconsistent, inaccurate, and unverifiable information on this account and a thorough and in-dept investigation. Ive disputed and I havent received anything as such, but it continues to be reported in violation of the consumer laws.  Continues to report wrong balance, incorrect date of first delinquency, wrong date of last active, inconsistent payment status, high balance and actual balance is questionable, etc. I believe that section 609 of FCRA also allows me to ask for detail information about the account and how you indeed investigated and your detail process. Im extremely upset and shocked about the way this charge-off account is reporting on my credit report which continues to report with incomplete, inconsistent and unverifiable Info.

"I have been trying to find help and each time I reach out my problem worsens. My student loans went into default during the pandemic. U.S. Dept of Education transferred my loans in XX/XX/XXXX ( while they were suspended during the Cares Act ). I was never told of this, until noticing my credit report took a major plunge. Since then, I have been flagged on my credit as no payment ( even though they are suspended due to the Cares Act ).  I tried disputing with credit bureaus only to have my score lowered. I filed a complaint when I noticed my score dropped XXXX points due to student loan payments. When that didnt work, I filed a complaint with you regarding my student loans and everything that has been happening regarding them. The issue has worsened due to filing a complaint. Now, on my credit report, I am showing 80 missed payments for student loans from XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX for four of the loans.  My question is how is this possible. My loans currently are suspended with 0 % interest rate. How can 80 missed payments be legally put on my credit report if I am not required to make payments until after XX/XX/XXXX?  Ever time I try to dispute, my credit score is more affected.  I try calling to get original loan terms and a history of my payments and I never get help. I called today, XX/XX/XXXX, and was given a website XXXX  and was told I can see all my payment history. When I go to the website, it states none of my payment history is available currently.  I also have screen shots attached showing my direct federal loans defaulted or not defaulted are eligible for 0 % interest, suspended payments if it states Dept of Ed is your servicer. They still show my servicer even though on my credit report it says they are not.  What do I do, I am stuck? I want to hire an attorney, but because of cost, I am hesitated to take out of my XXXX to fund this. The amount of points student loans has deducted from my credit report since XX/XX/XXXX makes taking out a loan not likely in my future to pay for an attorney. I have dropped over 200 points within 6 months and student loans activity is always the reason.  I am also a student and have been since XX/XX/XXXX. This issue has made my situation worse, due to the whole time during the pandemic student loans have prevented me from receiving any sort of loan due to reporting on my credit report.  I didnt think student loans could damage a students credit report while in school during the Cares Act. 80 missed payments have just destroyed any sort of credit repair and made any goal to repair my credit unreachable.

"Bank of America Regarding Late Payments on Credit Report We started loan modification procedures in the summer of XX/XX/2018.

We were told to make payments by XX/XX/18, XX/XX/18 & XX/XX/18.  We made these payments on time and have proof from our bank that they were cashed. These payments are being reported as late, even though they were paid on time per the terms of the contract. Bank of America is erroneously reporting this information.

"I made my XX/XX/XXXX payment on the last day of the month ( XX/XX/XXXX ) through the servicer 's website, which routes you to XXXX to process the transaction. The payment date that prefilled in that payment information screen was XX/XX/XXXX and the confirmation page again confirmed a "" payment date '' of XX/XX/XXXX. However, the servicer credited the payment effective XX/XX/XXXX despite the confirmation provided through their vendor 's website and they are unwilling to honor it or correct it. They stated that regardless of the payment date confirmed through the speedpay transaction, there's a box that you click on which has a list if disclaimers about the cut off time to process your payments same day. No one is going to look through all these hidden disclaimers to find that information. Consumers are going to go off of the payment date that you are allowed to enter when processing the payment. All other creditors pre-fill that date to the following business day if the transaction is after the cutoff but not Carrington. This is a disconnect between the servicer and their vendor ( which they're still on the hook for ) and rather than fixing the issue and correcting it going forward, its easier for them to reject any liability for the error. Bottom line is that if the payment is being made after their cut off, the payment date made available to the customer should not reflect an incorrect date, it should automatically flip to the next business date so there's absolutely no confusion. This is unfair and deceptive business practices which is confusing to their customers, yet they fail to acknowledge that.",['credit reporting or credit repair services or other personal consumer reports']
"In XXXX I realized I was beyond 30 days behind on my personal loan payment with XXXX. In the past through 2020 I have had income issues related to lost business  from COVID. They had worked with me once before to not report a 30 day late payment. While this has improved, my income has not fully recovered. I had to contacted them to let them know my payment may be past 30 days late. As soon as I could, I payed both the past due and soon after the current month was caught up. After having never reported a payment late before as long as I had spoken with them and arranged repayment, they reported this payment late. Inconsistent reporting, leaves you very confused about the relationship with a lender. Needless to say, this resulted in an 80+ point drop in my credit score, destroying it. The account has been brought current, but is currently just a few days behind and will be caught up in a matter of days. If they are going to enforce their rules, they should do it in all cases. In my case I have had always kept it paid, and when I got behind it was brought up quickly. Please have the late payment for this account removed.

In addition, I am currently unemployed and asked Wells for forbearance on my mortgage. Even though I filed for this, I have made every mortgage payment after I filed with them asking for forbearance. Wells is also saying they are not reporting current balances to the credit agencies as I asked for forbearance. I assume you are the correct agency to report this issue to. If you are not please let me know who could address this issue.

One day I was curious and decided to randomly check my credit score and saw it was knocked down 155 points. I immediately called the XXXX XXXX XXXX to find out what had happened. It's XXXX and they never thought of reaching out via phone or email. Instead, they were only sending physical mail and on top of all that they had the wrong address.

I have a credit score that totalS XXXX what Equifax shows, yet they sent the report showing that my score is XXXX. The Equifax rep said a mortgage score is different & when asking how do you all get that calculation she said she did not know. Again, my overall credit score is XXXX, my home is paid off, car paid off, I am not late on any of my accounts, & I have had these accts for over 7 years. As I stated to the rep how can improve the score if you don't know how or who calculate the mortgage score. So I can have excellent credit so I still can not get a loan when needed.

"Elan Financial Services is another creditor reporting inaccurate credit information. I had a scam against my credit card which put me over my limit. I paid the credit card bill as normal not knowing the creditor had increased my payment to cover the over the limit fee. The creditor accepted the payment for two months without notifying me what had happened. The money was recovered, but I was still held to not paying the over the limit even though I continued to make my monthly payments. I had never been past due before. I really feel I was treated unfairly. This was during Covid, and I realized many companies were understaffed. However, I dont think I should have this report against my credit without even notifying me until two months later. I have disputed the matter a couple of times, but I did not receive a response. The creditor put me in hardship per my request, and I continued to make payment less than I was making prior to this. However, they kept reporting that I was not making payment even though I was making the payment and they were accepting the payments.

"REQUEST FOR FREE ANNUAL CREDIT REPORT!!!  I believe that each consumer reporting agency has invalidated the true spirit of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act.

Since each credit reporting agency now has marketing divisions such as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX  and XXXX  XXXX, the automation system to obtain the free annual reports is looped into an information request to steer citizens into additional product offers that are excessive and unnecessary.

"Dear Equifax : RE : XXXX XXXX A substantial injury typically takes the form of monetary harm, such as fees or costs paid by consumers because of the unfair act or practice. However, the injury does not have to be monetary.

In addition, actual injury is not required ; a significant risk of concrete harm is sufficient. <P/>To determine whether an act or practice has actually misled or is likely to mislead a consumer, the totality of the circumstances is considered. Deceptive acts or practices can take the form of a representation or omission.

Ensuring that claims are supported before they are made will minimize the risk of omitting material information and/or making false statements that could mislead consumers. <P/>Furnishing certain deceptive forms "" It is unlawful to design, compile, and furnish any form knowing that such form would be used to create the false belief in a consumer that a person other than the creditor of such consumer is participating in.

He stated that any unpaid balance would be assimilated in to the modified loan. So I stopped making those payments. <P/>The modification was approved and I entered the 3 month trial payment period.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called into Equifax after setting up an account with them, and noticed many changes, in accurate information, as well as old information still being reported, on the Credit Report from Equifax.  I called into Equifax many times in reference to disputes that I had placed with Equifax, in reference to the incorrect information.. On one of my many efforts to reach a person who could assist, I was told that my disputes were being worked on. The next few times, I was told that Equifax couldn't Identify who I was, the next few times, I was told they couldn't verify if the information I was asking to be corrected was in fact correct and would't place a block as I suggested until this was resolved. In XXXX, I was told to mail in or try to upload supporting documentation or documents pertaining to the information that needed to be updated and or corrected. I submitted a USPS change of address form, copies of identifying documents and court orders of my legal name and their own form to state what I was disputing in the Credit reporting. I did receive some correspondence back from Equifax at my updated physical address in XXXX of XXXX which was after submitting the documentation. however, The disputes of my name, address and some of the reported Creditors, balances, had finally been looked into. However, not all that i disputed, concerning my name and correct and or updated address were resolved, nor were the items reported from the Creditors and some still seem to continue to soft pull my account on a monthly basis.

"REQUEST FOR FREE ANNUAL CREDIT REPORT!!!  I believe that each consumer reporting agency has invalidated the true spirit of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. The Act first established XX/XX/2003 was intended to establish a plan whereas common American citizens could obtain a copy of their credit reports at least once a year free of charge. Since each credit reporting agency now has marketing divisions such as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, the automation system to obtain the free annual reports is looped into an information request to steer citizens into additional product offers that are excessive and unnecessary. Even though I may have received an approval of an updated credit report from either XXXX, XXXX XXXX or Equifax respectively, it is unfair that I need to do a mail request since I can submit my personal information through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) portal. I believe that since the CFPB is the sole responsible oversight party of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, its imperative that any additional solicitation of information from the credit bureaus should be blocked permanently. I along with any other citizen should receive a free credit report upon request. The credit reporting agencies are an important aspect of the national banking system to properly function, but the current aggressive marketing campaign soliciting citizens for an arbitrary FICO score has gone too far, including but not limited to XXXX  XXXX.

"Ever since I was forced to file Bankruptcy in XXXX 2008 I have made all payments on time as agreed and paid off all Credit Card Debt Monthly Balances in Full. All other installment loans such as Mortgage, Auto and other installment loans have all been paid on time as agreed or paid off sooner. I have only applied for and obtained credit as needed. After following all of the purposed recommendations my credit score still remains well below XXXX. My score seems to bounce back and forth in the low to hi XXXX 's. I would not have had to Bankrupt in the first place had our Government been in control of our Mortgage & Banking Lending Practices. The Housing Market would not have come to a complete CRASH had our Government put into place Strict Regulations to prevent Appraisers from preparing false Housing values, Our Government continues to fail to Regulate the Banking Industries Lending Practices and it appears that we are heading right back into another Recession. As for my own personal Credit score. It appears that all three of the Credit Reporting Agencies are creating a false and very Low Unrealistic Credit Score. This has become very obvious based on my credit history since Bankruptcy. I believe they are doing this so that Lenders will not offer me the best credit available and instead these Bureaus are creating the scenario that forces me to pay higher interest rates and fees. Most importantly XXXX Credit Report is what XXXX XXXX XXXX is basing my Credit Score from. So I ask you again how can I improve my credit score to over XXXX? It is obvious that I pay all of my payments on time, keep all credit cards balance paid off every month and have done everything suggested by Credit Score as well as XXXX. I am frustrated by the constant interference by the Credit Reporting Agencies and their low intentional Credit Scoring that is designed to force me the Consumer from obtaining the best credit available.

Such violations have caused my FICO score to drop significantly and has hindered my ability to attain credit products. I have attached screenshots of my drop in FICO scores along with a credit card denial letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX in which the main reason for denial was a serious delinquency, as such delinquency, which was caused by Equifax 's lack of due diligence in regards to their FCRA responsibilities. These three accounts reappeared on my Equifax report on the following dates, XX/XX/2021, XX/XX/2021 and XX/XX/2021. I have not received any communication that Equifax has received any new documentation urging them to reinsert these accounts from the original creditors. Simply saying that they have new information does not suffice, as I, the consumer, must have proof of this new documentation, which I have never received. I have only received a notice saying the three accounts were reinserted, with no true proof that an investigation was conducted nor new documentation found justifying their reinsertion. Neither did I ever authorize these reinsertion which constitutes to the following FCRA violations : 1. FCRA 611 ( 5 ) ( B ) ( i ) 2. FCRA 611 ( 5 ) ( B ) ( ii ) 3. FCRA 611 ( 5 ) ( C ). Procedures to prevent reappearance I, XXXX XXXX XXXX, have every reason to believe that Equifax has not maintained reasonable procedures to stop this account from reappearing on my credit report within these three federal statutes : As I was never made aware that correspondence was ever made between Equifax and the three listed accounts after XX/XX/2021, when the items were initially deleted and between when the items reappeared. Equifax has sent me notices via mail saying the items were verified. Yet no explanation as to how they were able to verify this information was included. I have reason to believe that Equifax has conducted no reasonable investigation into the reinsertion of these accounts. My consumer rights have been violated and I am prepared to file suit against Equifax in small claims court pursuant to FCRA 616 and FCRA 617 if these three items are not promptly deleted from my Equifax credit profile.

We only had one car at the time and didnt have means to keep making payments before all the approval that the car was totaled and GAP kicked in to pay off the vehicle.

"I am a retired  XXXX XXXX in XXXX, California. Due to a medical condition and physical limitations, I am unable to work and my only source of income is my monthly pension.  In XXXX of XXXX, a series of unfortunate events caused me to fall behind on some of my financial obligations. I was considering bankruptcy but came across a debt resolution company online, Americor, which seemed like a better option. After a high pressure sales pitch by their representative, XXXX XXXX, I signed up and gave Americor power of attorney to negotiate my debts.  Unfortunately, my credit scores still plunged and it was difficult to make the expensive payments to Americor but I held on and trusted they would help me resolve and payoff my debts. Part of the agreement was a 25 % fee on settled accounts, which made me hesitant to sign up at first, but XXXX XXXX reassured me that it would be worth it in the long run. I was also promised a loan at 35 % interest after one year of payments to payoff any outstanding settlements. However, that loan never materialized and only offered recently in XX/XX/XXXX when I expressed displeasure with Americor 's activities. I was denied that loan.  What did materialize was an accumulation of fees, more than equal to the amounts that were going to pay off outstanding settled debts. In XX/XX/XXXX, I offered to deposit a lump sum of {$3500.00} to speed up payoffs of my open settled accounts. However, Americor aggressively insisted that the money be used as leverage to negotiate two larger outstanding accounts instead that were in pre-negotiation stages. I later found out why they chose this route, which was to continue to charge me the monthly settlement fees for Americor 's benefit, not mine.  I finally had enough with this company in XX/XX/XXXX and stopped all future payments to them. I demanded a detailed accounting records and any documentation to assist me to contact any outstanding accounts to resume payments directly to them or pay them off. I paid off all outstanding accounts except for two larger balance accounts, which ironically, I was able to easily negotiate a reasonable resolution without Americor 's assistance.  After recently reviewing the accounting records of my Americor account, and to my dismay, I realized I had paid over 77 % fees, not the contracted 25 %! This angered me even more and prompt me to file this complaint with the California DFPI and with the CFPB for Americor 's unfair and unethical financial practices.  I gave Americor an opportunity to resolve this before I filed this complaint but to date, they have not responded.  I have lots of documents to upload for your review related to this matter.

"Dear CFPB and Prosper.com, I recently noticed ( Last month ) that I was late on my account, and I called Prosper.com immediately to schedule full payment that was processed on XX/XX/XXXX and I set up another payment that was processed on XX/XX/XXXX, but I wanted to send you in writing a request and favor to ask you if you could grant me a "" goodwill adjustment '' to remove late payments from my credit report.   This would mean a world to me, as I have never been late ... and somehow I missed email and notifications from you that I was late this time.   I just recently checked my credit score and score went down by 84 points just because of this specific late payment ... and I want to take a second and explain what happened.  For several years now ( since XX/XX/XXXX ), I have been with you guys ( XXXX ), and I already paid off two other loans ... and I am actually very close to finish paying this 3rd one as well ( I am at 90 % paid off ), and recently I changed my bank accounts ... which resulted in auto payments not being able to process.   I never received phone call from PROSPER, and since I am not receiving paper bills ( I was signed up in autopay ), I was not aware of the missed payments.   I would like to request a favor to remove this late payments from my account and my credit report, if any way possible.   I was never late on any payments to any creditors ever in the past 9 years ... and I simply didn't realize that I was late to you guys ...   Thank you so much for understanding and I appreciate you for landing me money in the past and for hopefully helping me remove this negative report from my credit.  If there is anything else I need to do, please let me know.   I look forward to your response and doing business with you guys in the future as well. I have referred several of my friends and family members to you guys as well, and will continue to do so.   Thank You So So Much once again for your help and I hope that you can forgive me for being late.

"I received my free credit report on XX/XX/XXXX and noticed that Equifax is reporting in error in public records chapter XXXX bankruptcy. I never filed chapter XXXX, I filed Chapter XXXX bankruptcy that was discharged on XX/XX/XXXX. I submitted a dispute to Equifax 3 times on XX/XX/XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and asked them to remove the incorrect information. In response not only did Equifax not remove fictitious Chapter XXXX, they added verified date XXXX XXXX. So not only they did not remove the wrong information, they made it look as more recent bankruptcy. Equifax created a financial hardship for me and my family. I am self employed and my business depends on my credit. in the last 30 days 2 credit card companies cancelled my credit cards accounts and 1 reduced my available credit line. I tried calling Equifax multiple times, every time customer service representative told me that they do not see Chapter XXXX on my report and when I asked to speak to a supervisor, was placed on hold for a long time and then call was disconnected. I would appreciate if you can help to hold Equifax accountable for reporting incorrect information.",['credit reporting or credit repair services or other personal consumer reports']
