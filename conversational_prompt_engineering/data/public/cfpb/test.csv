"My mortgage company XXXX XXXX XXXX  closed their doors abruptly. They turned over payment history to XXXX. I paid XXXX XXXX XXXX  through their company all the way to XXXX. Then started making payments to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX. I was never behind on my payments. Due to reporting only until XXXX and I making my payments through XXXX, XXXX XXXX reported me as delinquent and I wasn't.   When I contacted them about the discrepancy, they told me because I was in Bankruptcy my payments are posting late. They told me I wasn't behind it was my bankruptcy. Then they reported me 90 days due when I was not past due. Not only did I have to pay three mortgages I already paid to keep my house over their errors, they are reporting me as derogative on my credit report now XXXX of XXXX. I haven't been with this company since before the pandemic started in XXXX.   On top of that, XXXX XXXX is listing my debt as discharged due to bankruptcy on XXXX.

"On or around XX/XX/22 I submitted a dispute for fraudulent inquiries appearing on my Equifax Credit Report. In accordance with requirements set forth under Section 605B of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I provided a copy of my drivers license, a list of the fraudulent inquiries that I did not consent to or authorize, a copy of the Identity Theft Report that was filed with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and a copy of the police report regarding the identity theft filed with the XXXX  XXXX Police Department ( XXXX ).   Despite this, Equifax failed to block the information. On XX/XX/22 Equifax sent correspondence state that they are not blocking the information, but instead will contact each company. The letter goes on to state that in order for Equifax to block information under Section 605 ( B ) I must provide proof of identity, 605B of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, you need to provide proof of your identity, the specific information that is the result of identity theft, and a copy of my FTC Identity Theft Report or police report regarding the identity theft.   Given that all of the information that is required to block fraudulent information was already provided Equifax and was received by Equifax as evidenced by certified mail receipts, they are required to block this information. Equifaxs ongoing failure to remove the fraudulent inquiries is a violation of my rights under the FCRA."
"XXXX and Equifax are still reporting unauthorized inquiries on my credit report, as I have requested that this information be removed from my credit report. I did not give consent to these companies to access my consumer file. I received letters in the mail describing the items to be factual record of file and verified as accurate and reporting correctly. Who Verified these items? they have not provided me a copy of any original documentation required under section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) & Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) ( A consumer contract with my signature giving consent to those creditors to access my file to do a hard pull on my credit file ) and under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA you are required to delete all information which I did not give consent to."
"This letter is to inform you that I recently received a copy of my credit report that your company publishes and after reviewing it, I found several items on the report that are inaccurate/no proof that it belongs to the alleged debtor. The accounts in question are listed below. Please send me copies of the documents that you have in your files as of this date that you used to verify the accuracy of the accounts listed below.   Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681g I have the right to demand that you disclose to me all of the documents that you have recorded and retained in your file at the time of this request concerning the accounts that you are reporting in my credit report. Please DO NOT respond to my request by saying that these accounts have been verified. Send me copies of the documents that you have in your files that were used to verify them. If you do not have any documentation in your files to verify the accuracy of these disputed accounts, then please delete them immediately as required under Section 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ) ( i ).

"I sent a letter to Equifax on XXXX regarding accounts reporting on my report that the collection agency could not verify. Equifax responded with "" verified '' so I sent another request on XXXX to describe method of verification.  The account got removed in XXXX, was then REINSERTED as un UNVERIFIABLE collection in XXXX.  Per the FCRA, a credit reporting agency must provide you with a notice of reinsertion within five business days from the date of reinsertion and must be reporting ACCURATE.  1 ) they did not notify me at all that this was being reinserted 2 ) This account has no creditor, no collection agency, and is incomplete and inaccurate.  Ive enclosed the letters that I sent, as well as a copy of the Credit report showing the original account I disputed, a copy of the credit report showing it was reinserted as unverifiable."
"I have several unauthorized inquiries that i have no knowledge of reporting to the credit agencies. i reached out to the companies and none of them would help me with removing the hard inquires off my report even after explaining this is a case of fraud. i did not sign, authorize or have any recognition of doing any legitimate business with any of these companies.   INQUIRES ON XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX Inquiry : XXXX XXXX, 2022 XXXX XXXX Inquiry : XXXX XXXX, 2022 ALLIANT CU Inquiry : XXXX XXXX, 2022 XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Inquiry XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Inquiry XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX INQUIRES ON XXXXXXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Inquiry : XXXX XXXX, 2022 INQUIRIES ON XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Inquiry : XXXX XXXX, 2022 XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Inquiry : XXXX XXXX, 2022"
"EQUIFAX is reporting an inaccurate late payment for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  account ending in XXXX. This is a 30 day late payment posted on XX/XX/2022. This is incorrect and supposed to be reported as PAID AS AGREED. Furthermore, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681a ( d ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ), a consumer report does NOT contain information solely as to transactions or experiences between the consumer and the person making the report. A transaction constitutes these late payments resulting in EQUIFAX violating my federally protected consumer rights. I did NOT give EQUIFAX written instruction/permission to furnish these inaccurate late payments on my consumer report or file, violating 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ). It is clear that EQUIFAX has violated my federally protected consumer rights under the FCRA and the inaccurate reporting is causing me and my reputation severe harm and discrimination."
I had set a credit freeze for my Equifax credit report after hearing about the hack. I had lived in a different address at the time. I called a few years later to unfreeze my credit report for a mortgage. I had to verify my identity to do this. That is fine I am all for being extra cautious. The address I currently live at wasnt updated on equifaxs end. They locked me out of my online account as well. Thats very annoying but fine in the name of security. I to fax in my driver license and send in a cable bill to prove my identity. Also very annoying but fine again. I called as well and they grilled me on my credit history. All answers answered correctly and they assured me my credit was unfrozen and that my account with them online would be working. They said it would take about an hour to be activated. I check back in an hour and nothing is working. So I called back and they said the system is updating so call back. I have called and called and they keep coming up with many excuses to keep from having to deal with this issue. Im not sure what is going over there but after I have proven my identity I feel like they are just preventing me from getting my credit unfrozen unjustly. This has been going on for a few months now. I just cant get any strait answers from them. I feel like this is the only way for me to get any answer. If they need more identity verification then they need to let me know instead of keeping me in the dark and coming up with XXXX excuses to avoid giving me any answers.
