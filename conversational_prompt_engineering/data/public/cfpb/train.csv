"On XX/XX/2019 I filed a Dispute with Equifax to which they conducted "" an investigation '' which did not consist of anything other than them contacting the creditor and getting information written on a screen whether that information was false or not Equifax did not care. Additional Equifax refused to accept any of the documents that I sent in as proof to include the letter from the creditor ( with the header and contact info ) that stated the information on my account was inaccurate as reported. On XX/XX/2019 I filed an additional dispute containing the same information as the original information to which was found in my favor to what Equifax has informed me of. This information was sent by Equifax to someone else 's email address other than mine. I called Equifax to get them to send the information to the correct email address. On XX/XX/2019 another dispute ( XXXX ) was created to send the information to my email address. This information was sent once again to the wrong email address. On XX/XX/2019 I called Equifax once again and the rep agreed to send a copy of the dispute to the correct email address, however, hung up on me. I have called back to ensure this was taken care of multiple times on XX/XX/2019 and spent over 3 hours on the phone without prevailing and was transferred over 10 times"
"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX Account # XXXX XXXX To Whom It May Concern : Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. Im writing this letter because I noticed that my credit report contains late payments reported on ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for my SELF/LEAD BANK Account, I want you to know that I understand my financial obligations, and if it werent for the pandemic of covid-19 and the loss of my grandmother through the virus, Id have an excellent repayment record. I made a mistake in falling behind, but before then, Ive had a spotless record of on-time payments. Im planning to apply for a mortgage, and its come to my attention that the missed payment on my record could hurt my ability to qualify. I truly believe that it doesnt reflect my creditworthiness and commitment to repaying my debts. It would help me immensely if you could give me a second chance and make a goodwill adjustment to remove the late payments.  Thank you for your consideration, and I hope youll approve my request.  Best, XXXX XXXX XXXX"

I received an alert that a credit inquiry was done on my credit through equifax mortgage services and I have not done any business with equifax or applied for any mortgages through equifax. I am not sure why they are assessing my credit but i did not give them permission to inquire of my credit for any reason and especially not for a mortgage. I havve never owned a home and have not applied for one through equifax. I didn't even know that equifax offered mortages. I have fraud alerts on my credit file with all 3 bureaus and it appears that equifax may be committing the fraud. their system is now even asking me questions about me having a mortgage when i try to verify to release the freeze on my credit file but i have never had a mortgage. It have issues verifying when equifax riggs up my credit file to keep me from utilizing it when i need to release the freeze from my file.
"This is in regards to the Equifax breach in 2017, I am trying to freeze my XXXX year old 's credit. I can not get a copy of his free credit report online because he is under the age of XXXX. I can not file to freeze his credit with the three credit reporting agencies online. I have to obtain on these special documents ( my driver 's license, his birth certificate, my SSN card, copy of my birth certificate, ect ) and mail them into the credit reporting agencies. I do not feel comfortable making copies of all these private documents putting them in an envelope labeled to each specific credit reporting agency. What if someone opens this piece of mail with all my personal information? This is not my fault this has happened. This shouldn't be this hard to put a freeze on my child 's credit."
