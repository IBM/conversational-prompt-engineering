"Over the last few years, there has been a trend of opulent destination wedding romantic comedies. Two years ago, there was ""Ticket to Paradise"" starring George Clooney and Julia Roberts and ""Shotgun Wedding"" starring Jennifer Lopez and Josh Duhamel. Most recently, ""Anyone But You,"" starring Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell, got rave reviews and made bank at the box office. So it was about time a watered-down Netflix version of this new sub-genre emerged. Enter ""Mother of the Bride"" starring Brooke Shields, Miranda Cosgrove, and Benjamin Bratt. Like a magpie, it takes bits and pieces from better films and cobbles it together with some paper-thin characters into something that is a movie in definition only.
I am normally a fan of the films Brad Krevoy and Steve Stabler (working under the moniker Motion Picture Corporation of America) have made with Netflix. I've rewatched both ""The Knight Before Christmas"" and ""A Castle for Christmas"" (also starring Shields) more times than I care to share. I've even written positively about the Lindsay Lohan vehicles ""Falling for Christmas"" and ""Irish Wish"" on this very website. Director Mark Waters has a pretty strong track record in the genre, helming star-studded films like the original ""Mean Girls,"" ""Freaky Friday,"" and ""Just Like Heaven."" Even his less-than-stellar films like ""Head over Heels"" and ""Ghosts of Girlfriends Past are, I confess, guilty pleasures.
So what exactly went so wrong here? The hackneyed script from Robin Bernheim, best known for writing and producing the Netflix ""The Princess Switch"" trilogy, strands the film's cast in shallow waters. 
Shields is game as Lana, a world-renowned geneticist nursing some decades-old romantic wounds. This vein of slightly neurotic, screwball comedy is something she's honed since her ""Suddenly Susan"" sitcom days. Lana goes into a full-on tailspin when she discovers her daughter Emma (an incredibly bland Miranda Cosgrove) is marrying RJ (Sean Teale), who turns out to be the son of Will (Benjamin Bratt, sadly sapped of his trademark charm), the man who broke her heart in college. Rachael Harris basically plays herself as Lana's perpetually horny cougar sister, who at one point describes a beefed-up Chad Michael Murray as a ""Hemsworth hottie."" Michael McDonald and Wilson Cruz play the token happily married gay couple, whose entire raison d'tre is to be sassy and supply the audience with exposition. 
Emma is a lifestyle influencer who has inked a six-figure deal with a mega-corp to which she has essentially sold her wedding as a product to promote their resort in Phuket, Thailand. While there is endless chatter about Instagram photo shoots and designer dress fittings, the film doesn't explore the economics in play here. What could have been a sharp satire about the commodification of our lives, down to those days that are supposed to be the most sacred, becomes a limp lesson in work-life balance. This theme is so threadbare it makes ""27 Dresses"" seem downright didactic in comparison. The only cast member who seems to be on this satirical page is Tasneem Roc as a singularly unhinged brand manager named Camala, who mercifully supplies the film with its few paltry laughs.
You may have noticed I have not even mentioned the groom yet. That is because he may as well not even be in the film. His character is so underdeveloped, he feels like those Instagram boyfriends who take pictures of their influencer girlfriends but whose face you never see. Only he doesn't even do that! Vague dialogue in the beginning explains his job and how he and Emma met and fell in love. Still, it's so inconsequential by the time you get to the actual wedding you not only don't remember who's getting married, you don't even know why they're getting married. What do they like about each other? How does he make money? Why does his dad give them a multi-millionaire dollar condo in Tribeca if they met and fell in love while working together in London? The script would have to include something other than stock characters to answer any of those questions. 
Maybe a film this shallow is exactly what this sub-genre deserves, considering how blissfully unaware any of these films (even the ones I enjoy) tend to be about the obscene privilege and wealth that someone must have to attend a destination wedding in the first place. Maybe, in some twisted way, the hollowness of this film is its own kind of criticism. 
Its a shame to see someone as talented as Shields end up in drivel like this. Ultimately, Mother of the Bride is the nadir for almost everyone involved. "
"Musicals made me a romantic. They taught me that some emotion is so powerful that it cant be put into mere wordsit must be sung. Some love is so overwhelming that you just have to move your feet. With a family that loved classic films, I remember being awed by Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire, thinking they were as cool as anyone in movie history. Characters in musicals not only understood love differently than those in traditional films but they turned that understanding into artdancing, singing and transcending mere dialogue to become something greater, something purer, something closer to true romance.
Weve had some musicals since the era of Rogers & Astaire, but few that have tried to recapture that sense of fluid, magical thinking in which characters communicate with their bodies as much, maybe even more, than they do with their voices. One of many remarkable things about Damien Chazelles La La Land is how much energy and time it devotes to movement and music, not just lyrics. The modern movie musicals, so often based on Broadway shows, have focused heavily on songs that further plot. In Chazelles vision, choreography matters and a simple piano refrain can have more power than a lyric. This is a beautiful film about love and dreams, and how the two impact each other. Los Angeles is filled with dreamers, and sometimes it takes a partner to make your dream come true.
The 14 Scariest Mythological Monsters In Horror Movies
La La Land opens with a bit of a fake-out in that its a large ensemble number of a variety that we wont really see again in the movie. Cars are stuck in the notoriously awful L.A. traffic when the drivers decide to break into song called Another Day of Suna bit about how each day brings new hope for these young wannabe artistsjumping out of the cars and dancing on the freeway. Instantly, Chazelles direction and the dance choreography feels different. Here, and throughout the film, he works in long, unbroken takes. You can not only see the dance moves, but you can see the dancers entire body when he or she performs them. And after the chorus-like introduction to a city of dreamers, we meet two such sun-gazers: pianist Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and actress Mia (Emma Stone). Like any good musical, the two have a few false starts and playfully mock each others flaws in their first scenes. But we know where this is headed and Gosling & Stone have the chemistry to make us long for them to get together.
The first major centerpiece scene is a long walk between Sebastian and Mia as the sun is setting over the Hollywood Hills. They start to see similarities in one another. Mia is tired of going on worthless auditions, ones in which the producer doesnt even look up from their phone. Sebastian holds on to an ideal version of jazz, wanting to open his own club instead of selling out and playing greatest hits for tourists. And Sebastian and Mia have a clear, instant attraction. So, even as they sing about how theyre not really a couple, and how this gorgeous night is wasted because theyre not with their true partners, their bodies tell another story with a fantastically choreographed dance number. Stone and Gosling arent natural singers or dancers, but they bring so much character and commitment to every movement that it doesnt matter. Theyre fluid, engaged and mesmerizing. We watch them fall in love through dance.
Of course, it helps that Gosling and Stone have the kind of star power that made so many of those classic era musicals memorable. Hes smooth and charismatic; shes clever and beautiful. The phrase has lost most of its meaning, but these are movie stars. And, of course, theyre more than capable when La La Land demands greater depth, finding characters so rich that the movie would work without the music. Its a story of artistic passion, and how easy it is to get derailed from your dream. Sometimes it takes another person to push you back on to the tracks to find it again. Gosling and Stone get these characters, finding grace in their movement but emotional depth in their arcs; Stone has never been better.
La La Land also exists as a very conscious ode to the allure of classic Hollywood. The pair goes to see Rebel Without a Cause (ending in one of the most magical scenes in years) and films like Casablanca and Bringing Up Baby are name-dropped. We have seen dozens of films that try to capture the allure of Hollywood, often with the cynical viewpoint that it will chew you up and spit you out, but Chazelles vision feels unique. It pays homage to musicals like Singin in the Rain and Jacques Demy's The Umbrellas of Cherbourg without every directly mimicking them.  
Its easy to let the world get you down sometimes, especially in a year like this one. Its easy to think that dreams dont come true, and that love only exists in movies. La La Land serves to remind us that movies can still be magical, and they can still provide the channel for us to see magic in the world around us. Its not so much another day in the sun, as the characters sing in that opening number, but the dreams of the night before, the ones we wake up and try to fulfill, that keep us dancing.

"The word that will likely be used most often to describe Denis Villeneuves Dune: Part Two is massive. Expect a whole lot of variations on the words epic and spectacle too. Whatever big words you apply to the result, Villeneuve undeniably did not approach Frank Herberts beloved sci-fi novel with modest aspirations, and its his ambition, along with the top tier of behind-the-scenes craftspeople with whom he collaborated, that have paid off in this superior follow-up to the Oscar-winning 2021 film. While that beloved blockbuster often felt like half a film, Dune: Part Two locates significantly higher stakes on Arrakis, while injecting just enough humor and nuanced themes about power and fanaticism to flavor the old-fashioned storytelling. More than a simple savior or chosen one story, Dune: Part Two is a robust piece of filmmaking, a reminder that this kind of broad-scale blockbuster can be done with artistry and flair.
Dune: Part Two picks up so closely on the heels of the first film that the Fremen are still transporting the body of Jamis (Babs Olusanmokun) home again after he was bested in the fight with Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet). After the massacre of House Atreides, Paul chose to go with the Fremen, much to the consternation of his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). Thinking both Paul and Jessica were taken by the desert and all hopped up on violence after destroying the Atreides interlopers, House Harkonnen amplifies its attack on the Fremen, leading to a few remarkably staged battles between the warriors and soldiers. Villeneuve and his team deftly fill the first hour with battle sequences that counter the firepower of the Harkonnen military and the Fremen tribal combatants, who often literally emerge from the earth to destroy them. Bodies fall from the sky as enormous ships burst into flames in a way that feels nearly operatic. Amidst the chaos, Dave Bautista cannily sketches Rabban Harkonnen as a wartime leader who is in way over his bald head while Stellan Skargard leans even harder into a sort of blend between Nosferatu and Jabba the Hutt.The 14 Scariest Mythological Monsters In Horror Movies
As the battle between the Fremen and the Harkonnens for control of Arrakis serves as the backdrop for Dune: Part Two, Pauls arc from nervous young man at the beginning of the first film to potential leader plays out in the foreground. A Fremen tribal leader named Stilgar (Javier Bardem) is convinced that Paul Atreides is the chosen one that has been foretold among his people for generations. Even as so much of the mythology points to Pauls savior role, the Emo King tries to blend into the Fremen, forming a relationship with a young warrior named Chani (Zendaya). Paul passes the tests put in front of him by the Fremen, takes on the tribal name of MuadDib, and vows vengeance against the Harkonnens who were behind his fathers death.
On another planet, an Emperor named Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken) counsels with his daughter Irulan (Florence Pugh) and a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother (Charlotte Rampling) on the state of Arrakis. Its revealed early on that Shaddam basically sent House Atreides to its destruction, meaning hes on that vengeance list that Pauls been keeping, while Irulan serves as a sort-of narrator for Dune: Part Two, dictating some of the political developments into a device thats really designed to keep audiences with the plot.
If the interstellar politics arent enough, writers Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts inject a nice dose of religious fanaticism for the inevitable think pieces too. Lady Jessica becomes a powerful religious figure of her own among the Fremen, guiding her sons ascendance in a manner that feels nefarious and unsettling. Dune: Part Two is not a traditional heros journey in that its constantly questioning if being led by an outsider from another culture is the right moveChani sure doesnt think so, and Zendaya subtly finds notes to make viewers wonder what a happy ending would be for these characters. As Jessica and Paul learn more about Fremen history and culture, they threaten not to lead it as much as dismantle and own it. Theres a big difference.
While the plotting in Part Two is undeniably richer than the first film, its greatest assets are once again on a craft level. Greig Fraser, who won the Oscar for cinematography the first time, tops his work there with stunning use of color and light. Its in the manner the sun hits Chalamets face at a certain angle or the wildly different palettes that differentiate the Harkonnens and the Fremen. The browns and blues of the desert culture dont feel arid as much as grounded and tactile, while the Harkonnen world is so devoid of color that its often literally black and whiteeven what look like fireworks pop like someone throwing colorless paint at a wall. Hans Zimmers Oscar-winning score felt a bit overdone to me in the first film, but he smartly differentiates the cultures here, finding more metallic sounds for the cold Harkonnens to balance against the heated score for the Fremen. Finally, the effects and sound design feel denser this time, and the fight choreography reminds one how poorly this has been done in other blockbuster films.
As for performers, Chalamet is likely to be the most divisive element, often feeling a bit flat for someone believed to be the Neo of this world. However, those choices add up in a way that makes thematic sense, enhancing the uncertainty of Pauls rise. Zendaya is solidalthough she lacks chemistry with Chalamet that would have helpedbut its Fergusons slippery performance and Bardems playful one that really add flavors here that werent in the first outing. Finally, Austin Butler leans hard into the exaggerated role of Feyd-Rautha, playing the sociopathic nephew of the Baron with all the scenery-chewing intensity that a character like this needs to work, finding the emotional void to balance out against Chalamets tempestuous inner monologue.
Dune: Part Two has been compared to The Empire Strikes Back in the run-up to its release, and thats not quite right. The better comparison is The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, another film that built on what we knew about the characters from the first film, added a few new ones, and really amplified a sense of continuous battle and danger. Like both films, a third chapter feels inevitable. Critics will have to come up with a new synonym for massive."
"Few things are as alarming in modern day American television as dialogue-heavy screenplaysfully loaded with insults, jokes, withering monologuesthat say nothing at all. If characters were properly fleshed out, their words would reveal their backstories, inner workings, motivations; but when theyre written as flatly as those on HBOs newest limited series, The Regime, even decent acting and intelligent costume, hair, and makeup design cant save the show.
The series ingredients are, ostensibly, of high quality. Will Tracy (The Menu, Succession, former Editor-in-Chief of The Onion) created the show; Stephen Frears is one of the directors; executive producers include Frank Rich (Succession) and Tracey Seaward (Philomena, Eastern Promises). Kate Winslet, also an EP, stars as Chancellor Elena Vernham, an emotionally stunted hypochondriac who left behind her career as a wealthy doctor to lead a nameless Middle European country. Consumed by fears that she will succumb to the same lung disease that took her father, Elena hires Corporal Herbert Zubak (Matthias Schoenaerts), recently disgraced for massacring miners protesting poor working conditions, to walk in front of her, everywhere she goes, so he can test the air with a hygrometer. Herbert proves his mettle during an assassination attempt, and soon Elena is in complete thrall to his beliefs about folk medicine and isolationist foreign policy. The problem is that Herbert, our stand-in for a working class stiff whose abusive childhood and frustration makes him susceptible to right-wing populism, earnestly believes in these ideas, and even loves Elena. All she really wants is for someone to quietly tell her what to do so she can do it and take credit. Its a predictably dangerous combination, and neither of them realize it till its too late.
There are a few commendable aspects of the show. Consolata Boyles inspired costume design does quite a bit of heavy lifting in Elenas evolution. Perfectly fitted skirt suits and dresses in bold colors (green, white, blue) are used in scenes meant to cement Elenas authority; olive green is used in scenes when she is meting out punishment. (She only wears trousers when she visits a union that is enraged by her anti-worker actions.) As she slowly adopts Herberts right-wing nationalism, Elena switches to peasant dresses, billowy sleeves, and embroidered blouses, not dissimilar to Republicans awkwardly posing for hunting photos in attire purchased in the previous 24 hours, or how Democrats kneel wearing kente cloth while doing nothing to reform this nations sickening carceral justice system. 
Perhaps my favorite detail is Elenas jewelry; she wears bigger, flashier earrings at parties, like many women might, and opts for smaller, more delicate earrings featuring floral designs for events courting support from farmers. But when confronting an American politician, she chooses gold hoops equal in stature and detail to her opponents earrings. Hair and makeup designer Sian Griggs (Maestro, Killers of the Flower Moon, Ex Machina) is equally worthy of praise. Elenas hair is an ever-so-slightly wavy chignon when we meet her, but as her Earth begins to revolve around Herberts sun, she adds a thick single braid, wrapped around her head, or sports a long cozy plait while promoting agrarian land reforms. I have no problem with the fact that Alexandre Desplats score sounds like a remix of his work on Wes Andersons The Grand Budapest Hotel; both stories are set in similar parts of the world, and Desplats film score is one of the finest ever written. And Winslet herself is reliable as always. Shes spoken in interviews about crafting Elenas accent, but what I find even more interesting is the downward droop of her lower lip, which deepens in moments of toddler-like petulance and indignation. 

But thats where the good work ends. We never learn whether Elena came to power in an election that was truly fair and free. Her cadre of ministers, bickering and fighting and sniveling, have no motivations other than the maintenance of their own wealth and power. The camerawork does not deal in subtlety. Overuse of Dutch angles makes the ridiculousness of the proceedings far more literal than it needs to be. Scattered along the way are some keen bits of dialogue, including observations about how imperialism forces smaller nations, especially those with valuable resources, to choose between allying with America/NATO or China, and that elites often try to curry favor with disenchanted members of the working class by weaponizing their frustration to malign minorities and dismantle workers rights. 

Were The Regime slightly better written, it could at least plead an identity crisis. But it doesnt even get that far. Its not funny enough to be a brutal satire about a needy, power-hungry airhead and her sycophants. (HBO already did that and called it Veep.) Its not insightful enough to engender empathy for its despicable characters vulnerabilities. (Ditto, Succession.) Hell, its not even unhinged enough to count as a European politics-inspired remake of The Idol. I got excited when I saw Gary Shtyengarts name on the list of consulting producers; few novelists working today possess his astute wit and devastating emotional clarity. Sadly, his efforts flat too. One wonders what an adaptation of his excellent novel Absurdistan, which is set in roughly the same part of the world and is far funnier than The Regime, would have been like instead. "
"They're looking for the right tone in ""Miami Blues,"" and they don't find it very often, but when they do, you can see what they were looking for. The movie wants to be an off-center comedy, a lopsided cops-and-robbers movie where everybody has a few screws loose. But so much love is devoted to creating the wacko loonies in the cast that we're left with a set of personality profiles, not characters.
The film stars Alec Baldwin, fresh from ""The Hunt For Red October,"" as Fred Frenger, an ex-con who has just arrived in Miami looking for a fresh start. He gets started off on the wrong foot. At the airport, he's approached by a Hare Krishna, and he bends the guy's finger back until it breaks. Not nice, especially since the cult member dies of shock.


Frenger is a thief, con man and cheat. He also is incredibly reckless and will get himself into situations a dopey high school kid would know enough to avoid. He wanders through the world looking for suitcases to steal, wallets to lift, identification papers he can use.
Nothing much is planned, and most of his jobs depend on sheer blind luck. One piece of luck, sort of, is when he meets Susie, a hooker played by Jennifer Jason Leigh. She's a student at Dade Junior College, working her way through school, and she isn't very bright. In fact, she's so slow to catch on that conversation with her involves saying things, and then explaining them, and then telling her it doesn't matter anyway.

Fred Ward is Sgt. Hoke Moseley, assigned to the case. His life is composed of equal parts of indigestion, alimony and bureaucracy. Some simpleminded detective work leads him to Frenger. Fred and Susie, now living together, invite him to dinner and he stays gratefully, eating their chops and drinking their beer and belching cheerfully. He figures maybe Frenger broke the Hare Krishna's fingers but didn't mean to kill him, and, truth to tell, he isn't very worked up over the case - not until Frenger visits his hotel room, beats him senseless and steals his badge, gun and false teeth. That's going too far.
Armed with identification as a cop, Frenger turns into a loose cannon, free-lancing all over town. He busts up robberies, steals from previous victims, flashes his badge and takes advantage of that split-second of doubt and guilt that's felt by the average citizen when anybody flashes a badge. And then the situation escalates as Frenger stupidly gets into more and more trouble, and Susie - who never was a very good hooker, but has convinced herself she could be a good wife - slowly realizes she is living with a very dangerous man.

The actors struggle manfully with their roles. Baldwin, who is good at playing intelligence, is not so good here at playing an ex-con with a screw loose. Ward does a better job with the police sergeant; in movies like this and the underrated ""UFO,"" he sits back and takes everything in and plays the cynic who will really bother you only if you really bother him. Jennifer Jason Leigh is another actress who has an easier time of playing smart (as she did in ""Heart Of Midnight"") than playing dumb. In ""Miami Blues,"" I think she plays too dumb - so dim that even the characters begin commenting on how she doesn't pick up on every little thing.
The movie was written and directed by George Armitage and produced by Jonathan Demme. Both are graduates of the Roger Corman low-budget exploitation assembly line of the 1960s, when Armitage directed ""Private Duty Nurses"" while Demme was writing ""Angels Hard as They Come."" Demme has gone on to develop his own idiosyncratic and likable directing style in movies like ""Married to the Mob"" and ""Something Wild."" The problem is, Demme can do those movies but most people can't - and there are stretches where ""Miami Blues"" plays like a Demme film with sprung rhythm.

"It is only now that I am in a condition to appreciate the 1950s.
At the time, I was too cynical. I read Mad magazine and listened to Stan Freberg and Bob & Ray, and viewed all manifestations of 1950s teenage culture with the superiority of one who had read Look Homeward, Angel and knew, even then, that you could not go home again.
Now things are different. Battered and weary after the craziness of the 1960s, the self-righteousness of the 1970s and the greed of the 1980s, I want to go home again, oh, so desperately - home to that land of drive-in restaurants and Chevy Bel-Airs, making out and rock 'n' roll and drag races and Studebakers, Elvis and James Dean and black leather jackets. Not that I ever owned a black leather jacket. Even today, I do not have the nerve. Black leather suggests a degree of badness I never could aspire to.
Feelings like these are what John Waters' ""Cry-Baby"" is about. The movie takes place in 1954, in Baltimore, at the dawn of rock 'n' roll (one is reminded of the opening scenes of ""2001,"" at the dawn of man, an event less remarked at the time). The teenage culture is divided into three camps: the drapes, the squares, and the nerds. The drapes slick their hair into ducktails and wear black leather jackets and are proud to be juvenile delinquents. The squares wear crew cuts and want to go to college. The nerds are not made much of in ""Cry-Baby,"" but in my memory they were the kids who wore slide rules in their pockets and collected science fiction magazines and grew up, one suspects, to be John Waters.
The movie tells the story of Cry-Baby himself, played by teen idol Johnny Depp as a juvenile delinquent who forever has a tear sliding halfway down his cheek, a reminder of a grief he will live with forever, a teenage tragedy that has left its mark on his soul, a lost romance. Into his life comes Allison (Amy Locane), the good girl who has a crush on Cry-Baby and feels strange stirrings in her loins by the promise that he is as bad as they say. The movie's bad guy is the good guy, Baldwin (Stephen Mailer), who loves Allison in the right way, which is to say he loves her so boringly he might as well not love her at all.
The movie's large cast (large enough to accommodate Polly Bergen and Traci Lords, David Nelson and Iggy Pop) includes Cry-Baby's grandparents (Pop and Susan Tyrrell), a rockabilly family that lives on the wrong side of the tracks and musicians who seem to be on the edge of inventing rock 'n' roll, if some one does not invent it for them. It also includes various parents, schoolmates, local tramps and sluts, and the straight-arrow types without which the 1950s would have lost their point of reference.
If there is one constant in recent social history, it is that we feel nostalgia for yesterday's teenage badness even while we fear today's. As I was reading that ridiculous newsweekly cover story on rap music the other day, I found myself wishing that the hysterical old maids who wrote it could have been taken first to see ""Cry-Baby,"" so that they could gain some insight into themselves.
In every generation, teenagers find a way to express themselves and annoy adults. And the adults find in this teenage behavior signs of the collapse of civilization as they know it. ""Cry-Baby,"" which is a good many things (including a passable imitation of a 1950s teenage exploitation movie) is, above all, a reminder of that process. Today's teenagers will grow up to be tomorrow's adults, and yet in every generation teenagers and adults seem to have as little knowledge of that ancient fact as the caterpillar has of the butterfly.
It is an additional irony that humans have learned little from the insects, and the butterflies turn into the worms.

"Who is you, man? Dramatic film has long been fascinated with issues of identity, but theyve rarely been explored with the degree of eloquence and heartbreaking beauty as in Barry Jenkins masterful Moonlight, one of the essential American films of 2016. Moonlight is a film that is both lyrical and deeply grounded in its character work, a balancing act thats breathtaking to behold. It is one of those rare pieces of filmmaking that stays completely focused on its characters while also feeling like its dealing with universal themes about identity, sexuality, family, and, most of all, masculinity. And yet it's never preachy or moralizing. It is a movie in which deep, complex themes are reflected through character first and foremost. Jenkins film is confident in every single aspect of the way that a critic can use that word. Every performance, every shot choice, every piece of music, every lived-in settingits one of those rare movies that just doesnt take a wrong step, and climaxes in a scene not of CGI or twists but of dialogue that is one of the best single scenes in years.
The protagonist of Moonlight reflects the conflicted and fluid masculinity of young African-American men in the United States, even in just the way hes presented. The film is divided into three chaptersLittle, Chiron and Blackthe three names used to refer to the same person that we follow from childhood through adolescence to adulthood. Hes a boy and then a man who has trouble figuring out his place in the world, which is also articulated by the character being played by three separate, all-remarkable actors.
The film starts with Chiron as a boy, referred to by his bullies as Little (Alex R. Hibbert). We meet this youngster running, trying to hide in a boarded up apartment from the kids who want to beat him up. Little is found there by Juan (Mahershala Ali, doing career-best work), a local drug dealer. Juan takes the kid out to eat, even bringing him back to his place, where he meets his partner Teresa (Janelle Mone). Little could use this makeshift family. His dad is gone and his mother Paula (Naomie Harris) happens to be one of Juans best clients. Juan becomes something of a father figure, but that might make this relationship sound more predictable than it is. Juan sees something good in Chiron and wants to help this quiet boy, even as he provides the product thats ruining his home life.
The film jumps to Chiron as a teenager, dealing with more intense bullying and questions about sexuality. These are the years in which everyone claims to be sleeping around and a young man like Chiron (now played by Ashton Sanders) struggles to find himself, especially now that all semblance of a normal home life is gone. He literally has nothing, and it takes kindness from his friend Kevin (played by Jharrel Jerome at this age) to bring him comfort. But even that is turned in a time, place and age in which compassion is sorely lacking, when young men believe that violence is the answer to what will make them feel better or allow them to fit in.
Finally, we meet Chiron as a young adult, played with remarkable subtlety by Trevante Rhodes. Kevin (now played by Andr Holland of The Knick) reaches out to a very-different Chiron, and the films themes coalesce in a surprisingly emotionally resonant way without monologues or heavy-handed melodrama. In a sense, Moonlight is a coming-of-age story about a boy often overlooked by society, that little kid not cool enough to hang with the bigger ones and without the support of a family to keep him from simply disappearing into the night.
The trio of performances that make up Chiron from Hibbert/Sanders/Rhodes are perfectly calibrated by Jenkins, who directs them to feel not like imitations of each other but express growth. We can see the sad eyes of Chiron as a boy reflected in Chiron as a man. Moonlight could have easily felt episodic, especially with three actors playing the same character, but its stunning how much it never falters in that regard. Jenkins work with his ensemble creates consistency from chapter to chapter, even as the cast changes as often as it does. Jenkins also draws great turns from Harris and Ali, playing two of the most influential people in Chirons life.
Jenkins and his technical team shoot Miami in a way that we dont often see, using their setting brilliantly, especially the way that the water and the beach around it can feel like a break from the troubles of the real world. But ""Moonlight"" is a film about faces. Chirons eyes say so much that this young man has not been taught how to express. He is young, black, gay, poor, and largely friendlessthe kind of person who feels like he could literally vanish from being so unseen by the world. During one of the films many memorable dialogue exchanges (written by Jenkins, adapted from a play by Tarell McCraney), Chiron speaks of crying so much in his life that he feels like he could simply turn to liquid and roll into the ocean.
While theres memorable dialogue in Moonlight, its whats unsaid that really resonates. Its the look of a morally complex father figure when a child asks him why other kids call him a bad word. Its a nervous glance between two young men who know something is a little different about their relationship but society has given them no words to express it. And its in the final scenes of the filmin which Jenkins knows hes laid the groundwork, trusts his actors and allows the emotions of whats unsaid to provide the dramatic thrustthat Moonlight makes its greatest impact. Jenkins deeply understands that it is human connection that forms us, that changes our trajectory and makes us who we are.

"The most surprising discovery audiences are making about Steve Martin at this stage of his career is that he is a warm actor - warm, and yet not ingratiating. My image of Martin, formed from his stage persona and his early movies, was of a chilly wise-guy of undeniable intelligence but little empathy. And yet look at his best recent screen roles, in the movies ""Parenthood,"" ""L.A. Story"" and now ""Father of the Bride."" He's one of the most empathetic men on the screen.
In ""Father of the Bride,"" his character is inspired by a 1950 Spencer Tracy role, and it's fair to say he is as likable as Tracy. Perhaps more to the point, he plays a role much like the one played by Alan Alda in ""Betsy's Wedding,"" and although Alda has made a career out of playing nice guys and usually does it convincingly, I liked Martin better.

The screenplay is predictable, and if you've seen the trailer you have, in some sense, seen the movie. The screenplay is based on confirmations, not surprises; everything we think will happen, does. In that sense it is like a successful wedding. Martin and Diane Keaton play the rather amazingly happily married parents of a young woman (Kimberly Williams) and a small boy (Kieran , of the Culkin child dynasty). Their daughter goes off to study in Europe for a semester, and comes home glowing with joy and announcing her engagement. The father of the bride is not pleased by the prospect of losing his little girl. He is even less pleased when he finds out what the wedding will cost.
A recent newspaper story about the escalating costs of weddings told of a father who offered his daughter a choice: A nice ceremony, or a condo. This is not far off. The wedding in ""Father of the Bride"" is priced out at $250 a head, and of course the bare minimum guest list initially comes to something like 600 people. At this point, in one of the movie's funniest scenes, Martin and Keaton join Williams in going through their card file, seeing who they can leave out. (""He died? That's great!"") Martin Short has a hilarious star character role as Franck Eggelhoffer, the wedding coordinator, who speaks with an accent that seems to be part central European and part nasal congestion, and who agrees wholeheartedly that the wedding should not be too fancy, although his definition of moderation somehow includes three live swans. He handles Martin almost with pity; from long experience, he knows what the father is in for, and forgives him even the tuxedo which Martin insists is a black Armani and the coordinator has good reason to believe is dark blue polyester.

The best moments in the movie are not, however, the passages of obvious comedy (I didn't much go for the extended set-piece that involved Martin visiting his in-laws' bathroom and ending up in the swimming pool). This is a movie with heart, and there are little moments in it when Martin is deeply moved by the fact that this perfect creature he brought into the world is now going to start a family of her own.
There is, for example, a touching moment when he touches his heart, as if it will burst. Another moment when Keaton gently corrects his original vision of the wedding ceremony (lots of balloons in the back yard, and Martin standing at the barbecue grill wearing a chef's hat). And the poignancy of a moment when Martin realizes his daughter now listens to her fiance, not her old dad, for helpful suggestions.

""Father of the Bride"" is not as ambitious or as insightful as ""Parenthood,"" the film it should probably be linked with in Martin's career. Its truths are more sweet and gentle. But it's one of the movies with a lot of smiles and laughter in it, and a good feeling all the way through. The movie was directed by Charles Shyer and produced by Nancy Meyers, and their previous credits include two films in the same vein, ""Irreconcilable Differences"" and ""Baby Boom"" (which starred Keaton as a career woman who suddenly finds herself a mother). There are no great revelations of stunning insights in their films. Just everyday life, warmly observed.

"Crime fiction sometimes achieves the status of serious literature: Raymond Chandler's private eye novels, for example.
Elmore Leonard and Anne Rice are said to have the touch of the artist. Quite possibly true. John Grisham, current king of the best-seller lists, is also taken seriously in some quarters, but I'm not sure why. His plots are no better or worse than average, and his characters are at their service. His novels exist to be filmed. His next, for example, has been sold to the movies before being written.
""The Pelican Brief"" is the Christmas Grisham, halfway round the year from ""The Firm,"" which was the Fourth of July Grisham. It is about as good, but in a different way. While ""The Firm"" was a muscular thriller with action sequences, ""The Pelican Brief"" takes place more quietly, in corners, shadows and secret hotel rooms. True, it has a few bomb explosions and chases, but by Grisham standards it's claustrophobic.
It's an old law of the movies that ordinary novels are easier to film than great ones, because the director doesn't have to worry about the writer's message and style, if any. ""The Pelican Brief"" is a good illustration of that principle. By casting attractive stars in the leads, by finding the right visual look, by underlining the action with brooding, ominously sad music, a good director can create the illusion of meaning even when nothing's there.
""The Pelican Brief"" has been written for the screen and directed by Alan J. Pakula (""Sophie's Choice,"" ""All the President's Men,"" ""Presumed Innocent""), a skilled craftsman who has done about as much as possible with the material. Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington do the rest, simply by embodying virtue and being likable.
The movie opens with the assassination of two Supreme Court justices. In New Orleans, a bright law student (Roberts) is intrigued because there seems to be no obvious motive; the justices are on opposite sides politically, so their deaths would cancel each other.
Doing research, however, she discovers a connection, and writes a brief that, if true, would implicate one of the richest men in the country, and lead to the Oval Office.
Roberts is encouraged in her work by her law professor and lover (Sam Shepard). The movie uses shorthand for its character traits; the Shepard character is a recovering alcoholic who drinks or doesn't drink entirely according to the needs of the dialogue. No matter; soon he's gone, and Roberts has been targeted by sinister forces. She turns for help first to the FBI, and then to an investigative journalist (Washington).
The screenplay keeps its cards close to its chest. We see various scoundrels who seem guilty, but there's no proof until late in the film, and a lot of blind alleys. Some amusement is offered by the character of the President, played by smiling, bland Robert Culp as a man with the appearance of George Bush and the involvement of Ronald Reagan. There are some obvious villains, including the President's chief of staff (Tony Goldwyn), but the movie depends on ominous threats and sudden deaths rather than on colorful, memorable bad guys.
Because the atmosphere is skillfully drawn, because the actors are well cast and because Pakula knows how to construct a sequence to make it work, the movie delivers while it's onscreen.
That it contains no substance or meaning is not its problem. It is a clever device to take your mind off your problems for 141 minutes. I enjoyed it until it was over; I will have little reason to think about it in the weeks to come; I will forget it in a year.
It is depressing to reflect that this shallow exercise in Washington conspiracy has been directed by the same man who made a great film, ""All the President's Men,"" on the same subject.
Depressing, too, to remember that both films center on the work of investigative newspapermen - Woodward and Bernstein, who were smart, aggressive and political in the earlier film, and Washington's character, who is smart, brave, shallow and utterly apolitical in this one.
One thing the movie proves conclusively is the value of star power. Julia Roberts, returning after two years off the screen, makes a wonderful heroine - warm, courageous, very beautiful. Denzel Washington shows again how credible he seems on the screen; like Spencer Tracy, he can make you believe in almost any character.
Together they have a real chemistry, so potent that after the movie was over, I heard people complaining that they were never ""allowed"" to have a love affair. Any romance would have been rather tactless, of course, considering that the story takes place in the week or two immediately after her lover has been blown to pieces. Maybe with a Grisham story you tend to forget details like that.

"The Coen Brothers' ''The Man Who Wasn't There'' is shot in black-and-white so elegantly, it reminds us of a 1940s station wagon -- chrome, wood, leather and steel all burnished to a contented glow. Its star performance by Billy Bob Thornton is a study in sad-eyed, mournful chain-smoking, the portrait of a man so trapped by life he wants to scream.
The plot is one of those film noir twisters made of gin and adultery, where the right man is convicted of the wrong crime. The look, feel and ingenuity of this film are so lovingly modulated you wonder if anyone else could have done it better than the Coens.
Probably not. And yet, and yet--for a movie about crime, it proceeds at such a leisurely pace. The first time I saw it, at Cannes, I emerged into the sunlight to find Michel Ciment, the influential French critic, who observed sadly, ''A 90-minute film that plays for two hours.'' Now I have seen it again, and I admire its virtues so much I am about ready to forgive its flow. Yes, it has a deliberate step--but is that entirely a fault of the film, or is it forced by the personality of Ed Crane (Thornton), the small-town barber who narrates it? He is not a swift man, and we get the impression that the crucial decisions in his life--his job, his marriage--were made by default. He has the second chair in a two-barber shop, next to his talkative brother-in-law Frank (Michael Badalucco). He spends most of his waking hours cutting hair and smoking, the cigarette dangling from his lips as he leans over his clients. (This is exactly right; the movie remembers a time in America when everyone seemed to smoke all the time, and I cannot think of Darrel Martin, the barber on Main Street in Urbana, without remembering the smoke that coiled from his Camel into my eyes during every haircut.) Ed Crane has the expression of a man stunned speechless by something somebody else has just said. He is married to Doris (Frances McDormand), who is the bookkeeper down at Nirdlinger's Department Store.
She works for Big Dave (James Gandolfini), and when Dave and his wife come over to dinner, Doris and Dave laugh at all the same things while Ed and Dave's wife stare into thin air. Ed thinks his wife may be having an affair. He handles this situation, as he handles most social situations, by smoking.
The story then involves developments I will not reveal--double and triple reverses in which two people die in unanticipated ways, at unanticipated hands, and Doris ends up in jail. Ed mortgages the house to pay for the best lawyer in California, Freddy Riedenschneider (Tony Shalhoub), who is the defense attorney at two trials in the movie. Ed, who narrates the entire movie with deadpan objectivity, reports his summation for the jury: ''He told them to look not at the facts, but at the meaning of the facts. Then he said the facts had no meaning.'' The Coens have always had a way with dialogue. I like the way Ed's narration tells us everything we need to know about Ed while Ed seems to be sticking strictly to the facts. I like the way Freddy Riedenschneider tells Ed, ''I'm an attorney. You're a barber. You don't know anything.'' And a conversation in Ed's car between Ed and Birdy Abundas (Scarlett Johansson), a teenage pianist he has taken an interest in. ''You know what you are?'' she asks him, after he insists she has talent. ''You're an enthusiast!'' Yes, and he is mostly enthusiastic not about Birdy's music but about Birdy, but too fearful to make the slightest admission of his feelings. She lacks all such inhibition, and when she attempts to demonstrate her gratitude in an extremely direct way, all he can think of to say is, ''Heavens to Betsy!'' Classic film noir specialized in bad luck and ironic turns of fate. A crime would be committed flawlessly, and then the perp would be trapped by an inconsequential, unrelated detail. That's what happens here, but with the details moved laterally one position, so that you are obviously guilty--not of the crime you committed, but of the crime you didn't commit.
Film noir is rarely about heroes, but about men of small stature, who are lured out of their timid routines by dreams of wealth or romance. Their sin is one of hubris: These little worms dare to dream of themselves as rich or happy. As the title hints, ''The Man Who Wasn't There'' pushes this one step further, into the realm of a man who scarcely exists apart from his transgressions. I kill, therefore I am. And he doesn't even kill who, or how, or when the world thinks he does (although there is a certain justice when he receives his last shave).
Joel and Ethan Coen are above all stylists. The look and feel of their films is more important to them than the plots--which, in a way, is as it should be. Here Michel Ciment is right, and they have devised an efficient, 90-minute story and stretched it out with style. Style didn't used to take extra time in Hollywood; it came with the territory.
But ''The Man Who Wasn't There'' is so assured and perceptive in its style, so loving, so intensely right, that if you can receive on that frequency, the film is like a voluptuous feast. Yes, it might easily have been shorter. But then it would not have been this film, or necessarily a better one. If the Coens have taken two hours to do what hardly anyone else could do at all, isn't it churlish to ask why they didn't take less time to do what everyone can do?
