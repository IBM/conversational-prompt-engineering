"From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org Subject: Boeing TSTO (Was: Words from Chairman of Boeing) X-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993 Lines: 83 games@max.u.washington.edu writes: Re; Response from CoB of Boeing on SSTO ... >""As far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have >a better answer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some >of our customers about that.

Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried out extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some time. A good reference on this might be: ""Comparison of Propulsion Options for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92- 0639)."" by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing. The paper describes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve aircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems associated with liquid hydrogen fuel. Basically, it's a high-speed airplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane The design (the concept is also called ""Beta"") as laid out in the paper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000 pounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and life support. System design reliability is .9995. Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets and 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans. A 108-foot- long reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first- stage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy payload on an expendable second stage. To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a normal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3. At that point the turbofans, modified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets, would take over. At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing out, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like aircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions. Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff is about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225. The orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbs of LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust rocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin, with the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by- 25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would be stored aft. Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design's success is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact tankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel. The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design. They conclude while a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier, cheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater safety and mission versatility and doesn't carry the hard-to-handle and bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude ""In conjunction with its major use of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self- ferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide as close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical configuration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can be shown to be operationally viable."" >Is this really news? Does this threaten further work on DC-? Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for some time. I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL SSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re- examined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter. Does it threaten DC-???. Possibly -- There is a set of on-going studies trying straighten out the government's future space transportation strategy. MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms) are providing data to a joint study team back in DC. There are various factions and options vying for attention -- including shuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the ""4-2-3"" architecture), SpaceLifter, ELV upgrades, and various advanced vehicles (ALES, Beta, DC-??, NASP, FSTS, SSTOs of several types, etc.) NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy for future US gov't space transportation systems, and trying to juggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) against medium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and against the investment and risk of going to ""leap frog"" new technologies like SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta. It's a heck of a problem. The worst part of the problem isn't that there aren't promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens of them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in the near term. They should have a draft report in mid-June, with a final report coming by the end of the fiscal year. ------------------------------------------------------------------ Wales Larrison Space Technology Investor --- Maximus 2.01wb",['space']

I'll tell you about my first flight. At the on-set of weightlessness, my shoulders lifted and my spine straightened. I felt a momentary panic, and my hands tried to grab onto something (like the strap keeping me firmly against the floor) to prevent me from falling; I remember conciously over-ruling my involuntary motions. My ears felt (not heard) a rush and I could feel fluid moving in my head (like when you get up from bed while you have a cold). At that point, I ceased to concentrate on my physiological response, since I had some science to do. I was busy keeping my experiment going and keeping track of all the parts during the ""return"" of gravity and subsequent 1.8-G pull-out, so I didn't really pay attention to physiology at that time. After about 5 parabolas, I discovered that I was performing one of the tricks I've discovered to keep myself from getting motion sickness; I was keeping my head very still and moving very slowly -- all except my hands and arms, which needed to be in rapid, concious motion for my experiment. During the pull-out to parabola 5, my queasiness finally started to get to me, and I had to use one of those air-sickness bags. I was basically useless for the rest of that flight, so I went to the seats in the back of the plane while my partner (whom I drafted for just this purpose) kept working on the experiment while I was ill. (He was a vetran Vomit Comet rider, one of those anomalous people who don't get sick on the thing.) I didn't think of it as a ""constant sensation of falling"" so much as like swimming in air. It's very close to the sensations I feel when I'm scuba diving and I turn my head down and fins up. Jerry: : >And what is the motion sickness : >that some astronauts occasionally experience?

Henry, if I read you correctly, you may be asking ""If I put a blackbody in interstellar space ('disregarding the Sun and nearby large warm objects'), what termperature will it reach in thermal equilibrium with the ambient radiation field?"" If that's the case, let me point out that interstellar dust and molecules provide many instances of things that are, well, not-too-far from being blackbodies.

This definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government into the support of science; some of it is relevant in technology. There was little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of state universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII. The US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was mainly from university and private foundation funds. There were not that many research universities, but they all provided their researchers with low teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for travel to scientific meetings. Not that much, but it was provided, and a university wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well as salary. During WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure scientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they were not exactly in the areas of the scientists' expertise. This is probably because of the ""research mind"" approach, which is not to try to find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution emerges. This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to discussion about their problems, the job got done. The military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the future, and started funding pure research after WWII. But Congress was unwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the future supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as NSF, to do the job. It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly keep politics out. Also, the government did a job on private foundations, making it more difficult for them to act to support research. The worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which the government supports research the university will not provide funding, and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money. Suppose, as has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of a graduate student for a few months. What do you think happens if I ask for one? The answer I will get is, ""Get the money from NSF."" Now the money at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it comes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from getting supported. So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects get supported, and how much. Also, the government decided that the ""wealth"" should be spread. So instead of having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research institutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into being. And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating reseach proposals. As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal has to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals already done work to release it as the results of the research. What I am proposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find impossible, or I may find that it is too difficult. In addition, tomorrow I may get unexpected research results. Possibly I may bet a bright idea which solves yesterday's too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to something I had not considered can develop. This is the nature of the beast, and except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it is not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring more than minimal attention of a good researcher. I believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would have happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government is trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders. -- Herman Rubin, Dept. of Statistics, Purdue Univ., West Lafayette IN47907-1399 Phone: (317)494-6054 hrubin@snap.stat.purdue.edu (Internet, bitnet) {purdue,pur-ee}!snap.stat!hrubin(UUCP)",['space']

It would still be nice, and our group here at Goddard is looking in to it. -- David M. Palmer palmer@alumni.caltech.edu palmer@tgrs.gsfc.nasa.gov",['space']

But to add to this explaniation, each individual detector also has a built in fail-safe, just so the detector does not read the background radiation(i.e. cosmic rays), if I remember right, the detectors go off about 3 to 5 sigma above the background. This is so they don't catch particularly energetic cosmic rays that would normally set it off.

Interstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies. The ""large"" grains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with fair efficiency. However, at temperatures below 100 K, 90% of the thermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiating efficiency is poor. (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long wavelengths.) Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate the energy they have absorbed. Moreover, the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100 microns. Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longer wavelengths, and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them. In the extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectable by any conceivable observation. Worse still, IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a population of ""small"" grains. These grains have only perhaps 50 atoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to temperatures of several hundred or 1000 K. Of course they cool quickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_ the characteristic temperature is several hundred K. Even a small population of these grains can dramatically raise the observed ""average"" temperature. A model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has three components. These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal dust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust (Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K). At the ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors are respectively 1.9E-13, 4E-8, and 2E-5. The first two are roughly doubled in the ecliptic plane. To find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilution factor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, then take the fourth root. In the table below, starlight comes from Allen's number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent to 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75. No doubt careful work could do much better. (The person who suggested starlight had a dilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong. We would be cooked if that were the case. In any event, the energy density of starlight comes out about the same as that of the microwave background, and I believe that to be correct.) Dilution Temp. DT^4 Microwave background 1 2.7 53 Galactic dust 2E-5 25 8 Zodiacal dust (emission) 6E-8 280 369 Zodiacal dust (scattering) 3E-13 5500 275 Starlight 1E-13 5500 92 ----- 797 The fourth root of 797 is 5.3 K. Outside the Solar system, the result would be 3.5 K.

At this point, many congresspersons have been approached about the bill. However, for a successful effort to pass the bill, we need the best possible congressperson to introduce the bill. Due to his position as Chair of the House Committee on Space and Science, Congressman George Brown is the logical choice. He has a long record of support and interest in space development, and helped pass the Launch Services Purchase Act and the Space Settlements Act. There is a small group of activists in southern California who have assisted George Brown in his recent re-election campaigns. We are mobilizing this group to have them tell Congressman Brown about the Back to the Moon bill. We are also asking pro-space constituents to let him know that they care about getting America back to the Moon. Finally, there is a good chance that a nationwide alert for space activists to call or write George Brown to have him introduce the Back to the Moon bill may be staged during late spring, 1993. All this should produce a positive reaction from Brown's office. As more is known, it will be passed on. However, even if we are successful in getting him to support the bill, this alone will not ensure passage of the bill. For any bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist: either the bill must reflect widespread national support for an issue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits); be propelled by high-priced lobbyists (we're out of luck there); or have widespread support within Congress, due to small, but widespread, constituent support. The latter is the path that we, by necessity, must choose. This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large number of congresspersons' sponsorship of the bill. To accomplish this, we need activists to ask their congressperson to support the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now. To wait until the bill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have a congressperson's staff review a bill. If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet introduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently written. We appreciate all comments on the bill from activists and politicians. If you have yet to see the Back to the Moon bill, please request a copy by Email (please include your U.S. postal service address), or contact your local chapter of the National Space Society). --- Maximus 2.01wb",['space']

The way you power things is with electricity, so the answer to the first question is definitely yes. (If you meant to say ""propel"" rather than ""power"", the answer is ""sort of"".) Yes, you can use interaction with the Earth's magnetic field to get electrical power, and there are potential applications for this. However, bear in mind that there is no free lunch. The energy isn't coming from nowhere. What such systems do is convert some of the energy of your orbital velocity into electrical energy. There are cases where this is a useful tradeoff. Using power obtained in this way for propulsion is useful only in special situations, however. What you *can* do is get your power by some other means, e.g. solar arrays, and run the interaction with the magnetic field in reverse, pumping energy *into* the orbit rather than taking energy out of it.

Well, it would require generating an incredibly large magnetic field to repel the Earth's magnetic field (as a magnet can repel another magnet). Of course, this force only works in one direction, and the magnetic field generated has to be unimaginably powerful. Magnetic repulsion drops off as 1/r^3, and the earth's magnetic field on the surface is already very weak. It would require some sort of unknown superconductor, and special nonmagnetic construction.

It was a bit shorter than I expected. Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big presentation on the 777, and other programs. This year, it was much more bare-bones. In any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would hear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn't get to the mike, maybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed it in. After the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written questions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only had monitors downstairs. Naturally, I was crushed. So, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my question being read and answered. Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took. Presumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all the difference. So, on to the substance. The question was Is Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, such as a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing compete with the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed by Mcdonnell Douglass? Well, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me, then he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last part first. This is to the best of my recollection what he said. As far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better answer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers about that. As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off. The High speed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at this point. So, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial arena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that they consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them to persue work on their own. Now, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing. Actually, this is a mis-nomer, as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this guy is doing, however, he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space lifter contracts. He won't tell me what he is doing, but maybe this is where the TSTO action is taking place at boeing. At the very minimum, the chairman of the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind, and they are trying to do something with it. Anybody know anything further? Is this really news?

Keep boxing the compass chaps, you`ll get round to it eventually. The Great Western was a highly successful transatlantic mail ship, with hybrid sail and steam propulsion. The Great Eastern, which broke the 'Little Giant' financially and otherwise, was a revolutionary leap forward in ship design. A thirty thousand ton all steel vessel, with primary steam propulsion, it was at the time easily the biggest ocean going vessel ever built. Brunel took advantage of the fact that cargo and / or fuel capacity rose with the cube of scale, while drag rose with the square, so a really big ship could steam thousands of miles without coaling. Unfortunately, there was no real market for such a beast at the time, and it was eventually sold off at scrap values. As another poster said, it then went on to a successful career as a telegraph cable laying ship. It was in fact the only ship of its day capable of laying a transatlantic cable in one go, with the endurance and capacity to carry the huge reel all the way, and the manoeuverabilty to dredge for defective sections. See Arthur C Clarke`s book ""How the World was One"" [ I think that`s right ] If that`s how the Shuttle goes down in history, as a technical triumph and a financial disaster for the builder, it would not be entirely ignoble, but I doubt if history will be so charitable. Its true the Shuttle can do things no other launch system can do, but are they worth doing?

Keywords: tether, SARSAT, navigation Nntp-Posting-Host: well.sf.ca.us Organization: The Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link, Sausalito, CA Lines: 38 We are interested in constructing a reentry vehicle to be deployed from a tether attached to an orbiting platform. This will be a follow on to our succesful deployment of a 20 kilometer tether on the March 29 flight of SEDS (Small Expendable Deployment System), which released an instrumented payload that reentered the earth's atmosphere and burned up over the west coast of Mexico. This time we want to make a payload that can be recovered. We want to build it from ""off the shelf"" technology so as to do this as quickly and inexpensively as possible. We want to be able to track the payload after it has deployed its parachute. An idea we have is to put the same kind of radio beacon on it that is used with SARSATs (Search and Rescue Satellites). It would turn on with the opening of the parachute and aid in tracking. These beacons are known in the marine industry as EPIRBs (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon). They are rugged (they have to be to survive a ship wreck!) and cheap. We have several questions: 1. What is the world authority regulating the use of SARSAT beacons. Are there multiple authorites, i.e. military and civilian? 2. What are the regulations regarding the use of SARSAT signals. Can they be used for one of a kind situations with a long lead time of warning the relevant authorities, or are they strictly reserved for life threatening emergencies? 3. What is the coverage of SARSATS? Are they in LEO with only intermittant coverage of a fixed position on the earth, or are they in geosynchronous orbit? 4. Is there an industry organization governing the use and manufacture of these transponders?

How about the discussion of the STS Tether experiment. Ran forward, it would suck energy from the Earth's magnetic field, while trivially slowing the Shuttle. It could also have run backward -- if they ran electricity through the tether the other way, it would have trivially propelled the Shuttle faster. But an even better example comes to mind. There's this electronics guy, someone like Craig Anderton or Don Lancaster. Ten years ago he wrote about an invention of his. He could take a light-detector, run current through it at about a hundred times its rating, and it would glow. He got legal rights to this design of a combination ""fiber optic emitter/receiver"".

I agree that the desire for beauty is valid, but I think your desire to impose your vision of beauty is not. You mention the age-old desire to somehow get up there, but ignore the beauty of the actual achievment of that vision. You mention the beauty of a very dark sky, not impeded by the effects of humans, but ignore the beauty of the as-dark-as-can-be sky that is only visible from space, a vision that we, or at least, our descendents, may one day be able to see, in part, because of efforts that others call ugly. One day, I hope, humans will be able to look out, not upon half the heavens, with only nature-creted lights, but upon all of the heavens, with no lights. If advertising in space can help us reach that goal, it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it, than the 'pristine' sky of yesteryear (or yester-century), which is totally unreachable. One of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsern sculpture was a human form, in the effort of striving to reach a goal.

From: leo.wikholm@compart.fi (Leo Wikholm) Distribution: world Organization: ComPart BBS, Helsinki-Finland, +358 0 506 3329 (20 lines V.32bis) Lines: 44 A bright light phenomenon was observed in the Eastern Finland on April 21. At 00.25 UT two people saw a bright, luminous pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near Mikkeli. The head of the pillar was circular. The lower part was a little winding. It was like a monster they told. They were little frightened. Soon the yellowish pillar became enlarged. A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle of the phenomenon. At last the light landed behind the nearby forest. Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were visible till morning sunrise. The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in Lappeenranta. At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in the low northeastern horizont. The altitude of the trail was only about 3-4 degrees. Soon the trail began to grow taller. A loop was appeared in the head of the trail. It was like a spoon. This lasted only 10 seconds. Now the altitude was about five degress above horizont. He noted a bright spot at the upper stage of loop. The spot was at magnitude -2. The loop became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of the loop. A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright spot. After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails were only visible in the low horizont. Luminous trails were still visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky. The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket. I don't know if there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near Arkhangelsk, but this may be a rocket experiment too. Since 1969 we have observed over 80 rocket phenomena in Finland. Most of these are rocket experiments (military missile tests?), barium experiments and other chemical releases.

I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere > evolve given a range of physical aspects of the planet. The question > is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions. This is a good question. There are major blind spots in our understanding of what makes the earth habitable. For example, why does the earth's atmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does? The naive answer is ""photosynthesis"", but this is clearly incomplete. Photosynthesis by itself can't make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen produced is consumed when the plants decay or are eaten. What is needed is photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of the resulting reduced material. On earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic matter, mostly from oceanic sources. However, this burial requires continental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow that most material is consumed before it can be sequestered). This suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without continents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating an oxygen atmosphere. In particular, an all-ocean planet may have a hard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere. There is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere has been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least 2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 to weathering in the absence of replenishment. No convincing feedback mechanism has been identified. Perhaps the reason is the weak anthropic principle: if during the last 500 MYr or so, the oxygen level had dropped too low, we wouldn't be here to be wondering about it. Paul F.

I love this topic, as some of you regulars know. So, having seen Henry's encouraging statement about starting to talk about it; I shall. I feel that we as a community of people have unique resources to deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborate on the utility of spaceflight to fields which are as divergent as medical intensive care, agriculture, environmental protection, and probably more. I do not believe that the general public understands the impact of spaceflight on the whole of society. In the absence of such knowledge, we see dwindling support of the world's space effort. I believe that we as a group have the responsibility to not only communicate amongst ourselves, but also with others through print media. A well-orchestrated and technically oriented analysis of life science variables required to support long-duration spaceflight (like long expenditions to the moon or Mars) would be entertaining and educational to the general public. The objective of such an effort would be to compile resources and publications from accepted scientific and technical journals which would address each major life science area. In addition, ideas for further research and development could be put forward for the general public to ponder...allowing the general public to take part in the excitement of exploration. Individuals interested should be willing to devote an hour per week to running literature searches and finding journal articles. In addition, we need to obtain the assistance of personnel from within the halls of NASA and industry. I have appreciated the positive responses to date and I am personally eager to start this project. Perhaps we could start with debate regarding how best to grade the viability of various technologies for application to spaceflight. ken",['space']

Why is the general public going to be interested in the technical details of long term space habitation? I like the idea of the study, but it should be released to other scientists and engineers who will be able to use it. If you want a general public document, you'll need a more general publication. >I believe that if any long-term space exploration program is to >succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld >(i.e. the spacecraft). Only through the careful analyses of engineering, >chemical, biological, and medical factors will a good ecosystem be created >to facilitate human life on a long-duration flight. As one working on Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems, engineering the microworld isn't the problem. The problem is understanding the basic chemical, biological and medical factors to be able to engineer them efficiently. For example, the only way we know how to produce food is from plants and animals. Food synthesis is not very far advanced. So we have to orbit a farm. Well that's obviously not very efficient, so we use technology to reduce the mass and grow plants hydroponically instead of using dirt. This is where the engineering comes in. But new technologies bring new basic questions that we don't have the answers to. Like, in dirt we can grow tomatoes and lettuce right beside each other, but in hydroponics it turns out that you can't do that. The lettuce growth is stunted when it's grown in the same hydroponic solution as tomatoes. So now you have to consider what other plants are going to have similar interactions. This means some basic applied scientific research. And that's what needs to be done with all technologies that have been developed so far. We also need to find out how they interact together. That's where we are now. >So, I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective >methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies >which can be applied to long-duration spaceflight. First you need to do the literature search. There is a lot of information out there. Maybe we should just pick a specific area of long term habitation.

Unless there is an unbelievable outpouring of interest on this on the net, I think we should develop a detailed data base of the literature search first.

To get a copy of this paper, send a message to astro-ph@babbage.sissa.it with the subject line get 9304001 Here is the abstract of that paper. The currently favored explanation for the origin of \GRBs puts them at cosmological distances; but as long as there is no distance indicator to these events all possible sources which are isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list, although there is no known mechanism for generating \GRBs from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \GRBs originate in the solar cometary cloud cannot be excluded until it is disproved. We use the available data on the distribution of \GRBs (the BATSE catalogue up to March, 1992), and the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits by Marsden and Williams (1992) to investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations between the angular distributions of \GRBs and comets' aphelia, assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect, at least to some extent, true variations in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the $\vov$ test to both distributions. We have performed a variety of statistical tests (a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the distributions in galactic latitude, a $\chi^2$ test for the spherical multiple moments, and a 2-D cross-correlation analysis), including testing sub-samples for isolating the effect of possible observational biases. These tests imply that it is unlikely that the two distributions agree, but the statistical significance is not sufficient for ruling out any connection with complete confidence. We performed Monte-Carlo simulations which show that only when the number of bursts exceeds $\sim 800$ it is possible to rule out a correlation between the angular distributions. Currently, it is only the combination of these tests with the large disagreement found for the $\vov$ parameter which makes the Oort cloud of comets unlikely to be related to \GRBs.",['space']

It took 7 years to build Keck I and now they are building Keck II.

Japan's 8.3-meter Subaru telescope will soon join Keck on Mauna Kea. All these telescopes will work in the infrared, yes, but they are _visible light_ telescopes! And haven't you heard anything about adaptive optics? A lot of research was done with ""Star Wars"" funding, and some is now being shared with astronomers. This shows great promise. Soon, probably within a few years, even the largest telescopes will be able to resolve to their theoretical limit _despite_ the distortions of the atmosphere. To say that ""visible light astronomy is already a dying field"" is pure hokum. To use the ""logic"" that things are already bad, so it doesn't matter if it gets worse is absurd.

I've admired both his paintings (remember the USPS Solar System Exploration Stamps last year?) and his writings on the history of spaceflight. For several years he's been working on a *big* project which is almost ready to hit the streets. A brochure from his publisher has landed in my mailbox, and I thought it was cool enough to type in part of it (it's rather long). Especially given the Net's strong interest in vaporware spacecraft... ================================== The Dream Machines: An Illustrated History of the Spaceship in Art, Science, and Literature By Ron Miller with Foreword by Arthur C. Clarke Krieger Publishing Company Melbourne, Florida, USA Orig. Ed. 1993 Pre-publication $84.50 ISBN 0-89464-039-9 This text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a technological phenomenon. The idea of a vehicle for traversing the space betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the tlatter half of theis century. The need preceded the ability ot make such a device by several hundred years. As soon as it was realized that there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to reach them. Tracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient, attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of technology, science, astronomy, and engineering. Once space travel became feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed than ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that matter. These also are described in theis book, for the same reason as the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are: they are all accurate reflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and knowledge. Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as well as selected events important in developing the idea of extraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically. The chronological entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and speculative ventures. They also allow comparisons between simultaneous events taking place in different countries. They reveal connections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected. Every entry is accompanied by at least one illustration. Nearly every spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing. This allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize differences, similarities, and influences. This text will be of interest to students of astronautical history, and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic diagrams. Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating. The unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and very interesting history of the spaceship. SPECIAL FEATURES Includes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and fictional Contains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos contemporary with the subject. This includes extremely rare illustrations from scarce books and novels, exclusive photos and drawings fromSoviet spacecraft; rare stills from both famous and obscure science fiction films, and unpublished photographs from NASA archives An index, bibliography, and appendices are included.

Let's see. Do I have a right to unpolluted air? No, because the majority drive cars and use goods that create air pollution in the manufacturing process. Do I have the right to clean water? I guess not, by the same reasoning. I could go on with these examples for a long time.... Look at Nazi Germany. Because of the majority, Jews, homosexuals, blacks, and others that were different had no rights. In fact they were terrorized, imprisoned, and slaughtered. In this country did blacks have the right to be free from slavery? I guess not, because the majority said that slavery was good for them. I think that a right has a moral imperative. If a law, imposed by the majority, is immoral, one should not follow it. In fact, one should do everything in his/her power to stop it. Of course, that doesn't mean that I would lose all common sense to break the law, just because I thought it was immoral. I pay my Federal Income Tax even though I am morally opposed to the U.S. Government taking my money and spending it on weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. This is precisely the point I am trying to make. We should _persude_ people by logic, pointing out that it is in their self-interest to let all have equal rights in all aspects of life, including adequate housing, food, and medical care. I just happen to think that for a full life the aesthetic of beauty and joy is also necessary. That is why I consider an uncluttered night sky a right. Have you ever been out in the desert, away from local lights, and most people? The sky is dark and transparent. The Milky Way is ablaze with more detail than you thought possible. The beauty and wonder takes your breath away. Now imagine you live in the worst ghetto, say in L.A. Due to light pollution you have never seen a dark sky. You might in fact never, not in your whole life, ever see the majesty of the night sky. Every where around you, you see squalor, and through your life runs a thread of dispair. What is there to live for? I admit these two scenarios are extreme examples, but I have seen both. I, for one, need dreams and hopes, and yes, beauty, as a reason for living. That is why I consider an uncluttered night sky a right.

I mean compared to football and baseball, the average joe schmoe doesn't seem interested or even curious about spaceflight. I think that this forum can make a major change in that lack of insight and education. All of us, in our own way, can contribute to a comprehensive document which can be released to the general public around the world. The document would scientifically analyze the technical aspects of long term human habitation in space. I believe that if any long-term space exploration program is to succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld (i.e. the spacecraft). Only through the careful analyses of engineering, chemical, biological, and medical factors will a good ecosystem be created to facilitate human life on a long-duration flight. So, I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies which can be applied to long-duration spaceflight. Such a detailed literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates and clearly important to existing space programs. In essence, we would be dividing the space life science issues into various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies.

After all the space walking, they are going to re-boost the HST's orbit. I think right now it's sitting at 180 miles up, they would like 220. I don't know the exact orbit numbers. I know when HST was first flown, it was placed in the Highest possible Shuttle orbit. Now the shuttle can cary a thing called the EDO pallet, or extended duration orbiter pallet. It's mostly LOX/LH for the fuel cells and RCS gear, plus more O2 and canisters for the life support re-breathers. maybe more nitrogen too. THe limit on space-walking is a function of suit supplies (MASS) and Orbiter Duration. In order to perform the re-boost of the HST, the OMS engines will be fired for a long period. Now the shuttle is a heavy thing. THe HST isn't light either. THe amount of OMS fuel needed to fly both up is substantial. a small booster carried up and used to boost HST on it's own will weigh significantly less then the OMS fuel required to Boost both HST and SHUttle, for a given orbital change. From what i understand, the mass margins on the HST missions are tight enough they can't even carry extra Suits or MMU's. Now if they used a small tug, I would bet, just a wild guess, that the savings on amss margin would allow carrying the EDO pallet, extra suits, more consumables, parts for the flaky FGS sensor, parts for the balky solar electronics, and still enough for a double magnum of champagne. or the HST could even get placed into some sort of medium orbit. The reason they want a high orbit, is less antenna pointing, and longer drag life. |> and that means you can then carry EDO packs and enough consumables |> so the SHuttle mission can go on long enough to also fix the |> array tilt motors, and god knows what else is going to wear out | |From what I've heard, the motors are fine - it is one of the two |sets of electronics that control the motors that needs a fix.

There would be some point to doing long-term monitoring of things like particles and fields, not to mention atmospheric phenomena. However, there is no particular plan to establish any sort of monitoring network. To be precise, there is no particular plan, period. This is a large part of the problem. In this context, it's not surprising that unexciting but useful missions like this get short shrift at budget time. The closest approach to any sort of long-term planetary monitoring mission is the occasional chance to piggyback something like this on top of a flashier mission like Galileo or Cassini. >How about a mission (unmanned) to Pluto to stay in orbit and record things >around and near and on Pluto... It is most unlikely that there is much happening on Pluto that would be worth monitoring, and it is a prohibitively difficult mission to fly without new propulsion technology (something the planetary community has firmly resisted being the guinea pigs for). The combined need to arrive at Pluto within a reasonable amount of time, and then kill nearly all of the cruise velocity to settle into an orbit, is beyond what can reasonably be done with current (that is, 1950s-vintage) propulsion. >It could do some scanning of not only Pluto, but also of the solar system, >objects near and aaroundpluto, as well as SETI and looking at the galaxy >without having much of the solar system to worry about..

Indications were that the spacecraft had entered a Fault Protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normal telemetry at the end of the previous station pass (DSS-15 - Goldstone 34 meter antenna) at approximately 8:00 PM the evening before. Entry into Contingency Mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetry indicated that the spacecraft was sun coning. After subsystem engineers reported all systems performing nominally, fault protection telemetry modes were reconfigured and memory readouts of command system Audit Queue and AACS (Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem) Starex performed. These readouts verified that Contingency Mode entry occurred shortly after 1:30 AM yesterday, 4/29/93. Preliminary indications are that a Sun Ephemeris Check failure triggered fault protection. However, the Flight Team will be determining the precise cause over the next few days. As of last evening, the spacecraft had been commanded back to Inertial Reference and was stable in that mode. The Flight Team is planning to command the spacecraft back to Array Normal Spin state today. Magnetometer Calibration activities had completed prior to Contingency Mode entry. MAG Calibration data has been recorded on Digital Tape Recorders 2 and 3. Playback of DTRs 2 and 3, scheduled to be completed yesterday, was postponed when Contingency Mode entry halted Flight Sequence C9 execution. The Flight Team is developing a strategy to restart C9 to complete data playback. Present planning is to perform playbacks between as soon as Wednesday, or as late as Friday of next week (5/5- 5/7), dependent on Contingency Mode recovery activity. DTR playback will be performed via the High Gain Antenna at 42,667 bits per second. Upon verification of successful DTR playbacks, downlink will be maintained at the 4K S & E rate. ___ _____ ___ /_ /| /____/ \ /_ /| Ron Baalke | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ /| | | | Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/ | | |__ M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | | ___/ | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/ |_|/ |_____|/ | part vegetable.",['space']

Basically, the U.S. Government has gotten into the role of supporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too long-term. (Historically, this role for the U.S. Gov't was forced upon it because of socialism in other countries. In order for U.S. industries to compete with government-subsidized foreign competitors, the U.S. Gov't has taken on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead R&D.) As a Republican, I abhor the necessity for our Government to involve itself in technology this way. I believe that market forces should drive technology, and the world would be a better place for it. But the whole world would have to implement this concept simultaneously, or some countries would have subsidized R&D, while others would not. So the U.S. must subsidize because everybody else does. (This sounds a lot like the farm subsidies arguments behind our GATT negotiations, doesn't it?) But this role of Government subsidies is antithetical to cost-effectiveness. The general idea is to spend money on new technology, and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture, despite the forces in the business world (like the dreaded quarterly earnings report) which erode the ability of U.S. industry to invest in new technology. And since our goal is to spend money, it makes little sense to try to save money. Of course, we could always spend our money more wisely, but EVERYBODY disagrees about that the wisdom should be. It's interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control available in industry today were derived from Government projects. GANTT charts, CP/M, and most of the modern scheduling software comes from DoD projects and their contractors. The construction industry has taken these tools to the core of their businesses; every large construction project now uses these tools. -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov (713) 483-4368 ""A scientist can discover a new star, but he cannot make one.

You should have heard Prof. McNally , from my days as an astronomy undergraduate, denouncing photon pollution. It was easy to imagine him taking practical steps to modify the sodium lamps on the street outside Mill Hill observatory with a 12-gauge shotgun :-) However, seriously, it is possible to limit the effects of streetlights, by adding a reflector, so that the light only illuminates the ground, which is after all where you need it. As a bonus, the power consumption required for a given illumination level is reduced. Strangely enough, astronomers often seek to lobby elected local authorities to use such lighting systems, with considerable success in the desert areas around the major US observatories. At least, thats what McNally told us, all those years ago. ( British local authorities couldn`t care less, as far as I can see ) I suppose that the ""right"" to dark skies is no more than an aspiration, but it is a worthwhile one.

Doubtless it will fail to meet some of the promised goals. The reason people are so fond of it is that it's the *only* chance we have now, or will have for a *long* time to come, to develop a launch vehicle with radically lower costs. There is no Shuttle successor in funded development, NASP is dwindling away, and ALS/NLS/Spacelifter sure as hell aren't gonna knock any zeroes off that $2000-$3000 per pound cost. Part of the blame for this must be placed on a Shuttle program that consumes many annual billions of the, er, Free World's available space cash. As you will no doubt hear from many correspondents in the days to come. (-: DC-X is an attempt to break out of the vicious cycle by keeping development costs low and flying incremental ""X-plane"" hardware. It's been, to my mind, incredibly successful already-- they've built a complex prototype in under 600 days for under 60 megabucks. I would have been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in 1990s America, never mind flying the thing, getting a successor funded, or building the DC-Y. I'm sure you know well that launch costs are THE basic problem for any expansion of astronautics. I don't see a realistic prospect for beating down those costs, for multi-ton payloads, anywhere else. If the DC flops, it'll be business as usual in space. The Nineties and the Double-Oughts will look just like the Seventies and Eighties, a prospect too depressing to bear. (Pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different direction. It doesn't lower cost-per-pound but it offers an orbital launch for under ten megabucks. It's creating its own market for small payloads.) I read the magazines and I've attended the last two IAFs. There are plenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems, some of them as good as or better than SSTO. There is no sign in today's world that any of these designs will be allowed anywhere near an assembly line. >You could change my view on DC-X if you could prove the following: [...deleting some things I'm not going to prove tonight...] >3 that the shuttle need not go on hiatus to allow development of a man-ratable >DC-X successor Strawman. Is anybody seriously proposing this? References, please. The DC must be developed in the real-world funding climate, which includes a NASA ferociously committed to continuing Shuttle operations, as well as the ""bird in the hand"" argument your common sense tells you. If DC-Y flies at all, it flies alongside the Shuttle, not instead of it. Also, of course, DC-Y and its operational descendants will be useful for a wide variety of jobs even if they are *not* man-rated. >4 Most importantly, that the DC-X will open up LEO to more scientific and >technical payloads. If a DC-X successor can fly a 10,000-kg payload for $1M, or even $5M, rather than the $40M it now costs, more people will be able to afford more payloads... for the same money, you can fly several satellites instead of one. Big outfits can fly multi-satellite series. Little outfits will be able to fly spacecraft of their own, instead of begging a ride. This is just supply and demand. You should be able to convince *yourself* that point 4 will be true, assuming DC makes a big difference in costs. Do you have some reason to think not?

YOu forget, that during skylab, they did overnight mission planning for the repair EVA's. Also during theøÄ Intelsat Mission, they did overnight WETF simulations.

YOu forget, the BUS 1 is already built. all they'd ahve to do is soup it up, even test it on a delta mission. Don't get into this mode of negativism. besides, at the rate missions slip, the Discovery won't launch on this mission until March. that's almost a year. |More Expensive: Your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it |was going to do execpt fire the OMS.

Big difference. That's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well known - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known) are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution... Merging neutron stars is at least a mechanism with about the right energy, except it doesn't explain why there is no apparent correlation with galaxies or galaxy structure, there is no mechanism for getting all the energy out in gamma rays (with any significant amount of baryons around there will be a lot of pair production, which makes a plasma, which thermalizes the energy), it has trouble generating enough energy to explain the most powerful bursts (10^52-53 ergs), it happens too fast compared to the burst duration, and it is hard to make tight-binaries of neutron stars. Another cosmological mechinism is the catalytic conversion of a neutron star to a strange star or the merger of two strange stars, but that uses pretty far-out physics. My point is that we don't have a good mechanism at any distance, so GRB's are likely to be happening by an unknown mechanism, so we can't rule out the Oort cloud. What would be the spectrum of an event which converts a comet to strange matter? The spectra for primordial black holes eating comets and antimatter comets colliding with matter comets aren't quite right, but perhaps there is an unusual mechanism which modifies the spectrum. The energy matches very well for both of these mechanisms. According to Trevor Weeks, if the ""Tunguska Meteorite"" was a mini-black hole collision with the earth, then there are likely to be enough mini-black holes around that the rate for BH-comet collisions matches the GRB rate well. The fact that we don't know the distribution of comets in the Oort cloud isn't a reason to rule them out; it makes it harder to rule them out. The point of the cited paper was that if we assume they got the right distribution for the Oort cloud, it is hard but not impossible to match that up with the distribution of GRB's. If they got the wrong distribution for the Oort cloud, they can't constrain any Oort- cloud GRB's at all. Executive summary: we don't know enough to rule out out the Oort cloud.",['space']

Some wonder whether or not the moon could have ever supported an atmosphere. I'd be interested in knowing what our geology/environmental sciences friends think. As for human tolerances, the best example of human endurance in terms of altitude (i.e. low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure) is in my opinion to the scaling of Mt. Everest without oxygen assistance. This was accomplished by a team of mountaineers who trained at high altitudes for quite awhile (I think a few months) and then were flown by helicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude on Mount Everest, where they began the ascent of our planet's highest peak without oxygen tanks. This is quite a feat of physiological endurance, because if you or I tried to go to 20,000 feet and exert ourselves, we would probably pass out, get altitude sick, and could even die from cerebral edema. So this is the limit of low pressure. High pressure situations would be limited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higher pressure. Skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations and could tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting the bends. Some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres of pressure (not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren't in front of me). Usually at a certain point, the nitrogen in the air becomes toxic to the body and you start acting idiotic. Divers call this nitrogen narcosis. Those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things, like taking off a diving mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at 100 feet under water. (Hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter, as I am not a diving expert). Mars cannot support human life without pressurization because the atmosphere is too thin (1/100 th our Earth's atmospheric density). In addition, the Mars atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide. Basically, you would need a pressure suit there, or you'd die from the low pressure. Interesting huh? ken khayash@hsc.usc.edu",['space']

This book is Volume III of a revised and enlarged edition of ""THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE"", 1959. Volume I is ""NOTHING BUT MOTION"" (1979), and Volume II is ""THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER"" (1988). Most books and journal articles on the subject of astrophysics are bristling with integrals, partial differentials, and other FANCY MATHEMATICS. In this book, by contrast, mathematics is conspicuous by its absence, except for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text. Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual validity. Dewey B. Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State University. He developed the Theory described in his books while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements they contain. ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"" describes the astrophysical portions of Larson's CONSISTENT, INTEGRATED, COMPREHENSIVE, GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, a kind of ""grand unified field theory"" that orthodox physicists and astro-physicists CLAIM to be looking for. It is built on two postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of space and time: (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE units, and with two RECIPROCAL aspects, SPACE and TIME. (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its primary magnitudes are ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN. From these two postulates, Larson was able to build a COMPLETE theoretical universe, from photons and subatomic particles to the giant elliptical galaxies, by combining the concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with translational, vibrational, rotational, and rotational- vibrational motions. At each step in the development, he was able to match parts of his theoretical universe with corresponding parts in the real physical universe, including EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED. For example, in his 1959 book, he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them. They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory. And when quasars were discovered, he had a related explanation ready for those also. As a result of his theory, which he called ""THE RECIPROCAL SYSTEM"", Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists, including black holes, neutron stars, degenerate matter, quantum wave mechanics (as applied to atomic structure), ""nuclear"" physics, general relativity, relativistic mass increases, relativistic Doppler shifts, nuclear fusion in stars, and the big bang, all of which he considered to be nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES. He was very critical of the AD HOC assumptions, uncertainty principles, solutions in principle, ""no other way"" declarations, etc., used to maintain them. ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"" is divided into 31 chapters. It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters, which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe. (Galaxy formation from the MYTHICAL ""big bang"" is a big mystery to orthodox astronomers.) He then goes on to describe life cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of SINGLE stars. Several chapters are devoted to quasars which, according to Larson, are densely-packed clusters of stars that have been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT (although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME). Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against observations that contradict their theories would find Larson's explanations quite valuable if considered with an OPEN MIND. For example, they used to believe that GAMMA RAY BURSTS originated from pulsars, which exist primarily in the plane or central bulge of our galaxy. But the new gamma ray telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any visible objects, (except for a few cases of directional coincidence). Larson's explanation is that the gamma ray bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls the ""cosmic sector"". Because the anti-matter universe exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe, with the speed of light as the BOUNDARY between them, and has THREE dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space, the bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly at random. Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from books, journal articles, and leading physicists and astronomers. In this book, 351 of them are superscripted with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the end of the book. For example, a quote from the book ""Astronomy: The Cosmic Journey"", by William K. Hartmann, says, ""Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars form.... Unfortunately we cannot."" Larson's book contains LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists, astronomers, and astrophysicists. For more information, answers to your questions, etc., please consult my CITED SOURCES (Larson's BOOKS). UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this IMPORTANT Book Review is ENCOURAGED.

"From: richmond@spiff.Princeton.EDU (Stupendous Man) Subject: Interstellar T _is_ 3-4K; notes on Pluto/Charon talk and Pluto Mission Originator: news@nimaster Keywords: I goofed Nntp-Posting-Host: spiff.princeton.edu Organization: Princeton University Lines: 73 (sci.space readers can skip the first paragraph) Yesterday, in response to Henry Spencer's question about the temperature of a blackbody in interstellar space, I said ""Dust grains acts as blackbodies, and they're at 40-150 K."" Well, I was dead wrong. Our local interstellar dust expert, Bruce Draine, has informed me that dust grains _aren't_ good radiators in the far IR, which is why they are so warm; actually, the ambient radiation field from distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only 3 or 4 Kelvin. Sorry, Henry, and anyone else I misled. Obviously, time for me to take another ISM class :-( In other news, Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute gave a talk on the Pluto-Charon binary system yesterday. He gave a brief overview of the currently-accepted system parameters (volume ratio of about 8:1, mass ratio about 15:1 or so, plus lots more...) and then gave his thoughts on the formation of Pluto-Charon. His idea is that there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer solar system, with masses distributed as a power law of some kind; over time, the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies. Most got scattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiter and Saturn, but many accreted into the gas giants, especially Uranus and Neptune. A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune - we call it Triton [captured how? Perhaps by a collision with a smaller, already-existing Neptunian moon, perhaps by a very close passage through Neptune's atmosphere - mondo aerobraking!]. He notes that the two recently discovered ""Kuiper Belt"" objects, 1992 QB1 and 1993 FW, plus Chiron and Pholus, are all about the same mass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the larger bodies of Triton and Pluto/Charon. Pluto/Charon, he thinks, formed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto, knocking some material into a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon; similar to ideas about the formation of Earth's moon. There is good evidence from spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different (Pluto has methane frost, Charon doesn't), which can be used as evidence for the impact theory. He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objects remaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune's orbit, beyond 35 AU or so. 1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first members of this population to be found, in his model. Note that such bodies will be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane frost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbons by now. The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, I think) is that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate, and when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it forms bright, new frost. So any bodies much farther away than 30 AU are going to be very hard to see. I hope I haven't made any errors in the transcription; if you see a howling mistake, it's undoubtedly mine, not his. By the way, he's one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flyby mission (I think), and said that the current plans are to use a Titan 4 to send the probe on ""just about a rectilinear trajectory"" to Pluto (we were speaking loosely at the time...). He'd like to use a Proton, which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs MUCH less. His figures: $500 Million for 2 Titan 4 launches (there will be two separate probes, launched separately), or $120 Million for 2 Proton launches. He told a story about how the Soviets originally offered to sell Proton launches for $30 Million each, but were forced to increase their prices in the US in order to be allowed in the marketplace. I'm just telling you what he said. Michael -- ----- Michael Richmond ""This is the heart that broke my finger."" richmond@astro.princeton.edu",['space']

I help it better to ask questions before I spout an opinion. We've been progressing towards that goal for 30 years now. We precede any orbiting mission with flyby missions. Of course, it gets harder to do as we work our way farther away from Earth. We're just starting to work out to the outer planets: Galileo will orbit Jupiter, and Cassini around Saturn. >How about a mission (unmanned) to Pluto to stay in orbit and record things >around and near and on Pluto.. Well first things first. We'll do a flyby mission first since it is much easier and faster to do. If the Fast Pluto Flyby mission is approved then we'll launch a Pluto mission before the end of the decade. A Pluto orbiter however requires a larger spacecraft and a longer cruise period. Orbit insertion requires more fuel has to be carried along and restricts the trajectory to a slower approach velocity to Pluto. I'd imagine though that we would be doing a Neptune orbiting mission before a Pluto orbiting mission, unless the Pluto flyby turns up something really interesting. ___ _____ ___ /_ /| /____/ \ /_ /| Ron Baalke | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ /| | | | Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/ | | |__ M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | | ___/ | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/ |_|/ |_____|/ | part vegetable.",['space']

I know that no small manuevering tug exists, but maybe one could soup up a Bus 1.

Hathaway The problem is no-one seems to have the exact numbers. When the mission was planned originally at 3 spacewalks, and 3 astronauts, there was enormous concern over the mass margins for the flight. THey have now planned for 5 EVA's, an 11 day mission and have 2 reserve EVA's and an emergency EVA. Obviously that is coming from somewhere. My guess is the OMS burn fuel, or re-boost margin. I just figured, if GOldin wants to really, prove out faster, cheaper better, have some of the whiz kids slap together an expendable space manuevering tug out of a BUs1, and use that for the re-boost. it has to be better then using the Discovery as a tow truck. pat",['space']

I know this is kinda off the subject of sci.space, but not really, I want to answer this for their, as well as everyone else's information. What these people are proposing, by and large already exists and can be purchased today. It is called labview by National Instruments. IT is a wonderful object oriented graphical programming language. IT has been implemented on both Mac's PC's and VME unix boxes. IT is fare superior to any programming approach that I have ever seen and allowed us to decrease the software development time for our shuttle payloads by 90 percent. This program is not dependendant on specific hardware and already has exensive analysis capability. Why re-invent the wheel on a platform that may not exist? It is a great idea but look out there at what is available today. The Hydrogen leak on the Shuttle was found using this software. All SSME control and simulation studies, along with the real testing at MSFC is handled with LabVIEW. There are tons of applications, with the ability to create ""virtual"" instruments that can accomplish any specific custom task the maker desires. With the addition of IEEE-488 support, the computer becomes a virtual control station, allowing the graphic representation of remote instrumentation. With serial I/O support that instrument can be anywhere. The ground control software for the main control of SEDSAT 1 will utilize this approach.

"From: rw@astro.Princeton.EDU (Ralph A.M.J. Wijers) Subject: Re: Gamma Ray Bursters. WHere are they. Originator: news@nimaster Nntp-Posting-Host: astro.princeton.edu Organization: Princeton University Lines: 51 I feel compelled to complain: the statement that recent observations rule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts is utterly false, even though it is popular enough to make it to BATSE press releases. The idea behind the statement is as follows: ""if you smack two neutron stars together, or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole, a lot of energy is released, enough for a gamma-ray burst at a cosmological distance. But, so the reasoning continues, this energy is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum. The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must be wrong."" As so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who was trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. It may be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray burst, but the 'fireball' of energy and matter that is created may spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding medium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may carry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All this is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees, Peter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers. It is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one around (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative proposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the so-called 'failed supernovae' scenario by Stan Woosley, in which a very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black hole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter will be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal force, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the black hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis, which again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such events may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers, but the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate of bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two scenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less in the failed supernova scenario. On another note: I do believe that the distance scale must ultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method such as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths, or finding a definitive signature of some known class of objects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theorists have historically not been too successfull in finding the distance of any object by proving that there is only one possible way in which the object can work, and therefore it *must* be so-and-so.

When they use the _same_ deconvolution software on the images from the fixed Hubble, be ready for some incredible results! There is every reason to believe that the results will _exceed_ the original specs by a fair margin. Adaptive optics is a combination of hardware and software. It works realtime, not after the fact, as is the case with Hubble. You might be interested to know this technology has made it to the amateur market, in the form of the AO-2 Adaptive Optics System. Starting on page 52 of the April, 1993 Sky & Telescope is a three page review of this new product. It lists for $1,290. The article states: ""The AO-2 Adaptive Optics System comes in a handy soft-plastic case that a three-year-old could carry around."" Even though this device is really only good for the brightest objects, ""it could cope with image movements of up to 0.8 millimeter in the telescope's focal plane."" Now just imagine how well this infant technology will do in a few years, especially in a dedicated system that has hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many man-hours invested in its development.

The question is whether : anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near : future, to the point of justifying development of such a thing. That's a mighty fine idea. But since you asked ""Why not,"" I'll respond. Putting aside the application of such a space dock, there are other factors to consider than just pressurized volume. Temperature control is difficult in space, and your inflatable hangar will have to incorporate thermal insulation (maybe a double-walled inflatable). Micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required. Don't think this will be a clear plastic bubble; it's more likely to look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multi-layer fabric that soft-torso space suits are made out of today. Because almost all manned space vessels (Skylab, Mir, Salyut) used their pressurization for increased structural rigidity, even though they had (have) metal skins, they still kind of qualify as inflatable. The inflation process would have to be carefully controlled. The space environment reduces ductility in exposed materials (due to temperature extremes, monotomic Oxygen impingement, and radiation effects on materials), so your ""fabric"" may not retain any flexibility for long. (This may not matter.) Even after inflation, pressure changes in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric, which could lead to holes and tears as ductility decreases. These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of success. -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov (713) 483-4368 ""Good ideas are common -- what's uncommon are people who'll work hard enough to bring them about."" -- Ashleigh Brilliant",['space']

The other x three instruments are focusing instruments, that, more or less, form an image, so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the resolving power of the optics. BATSE is an altogether different beast, effectively just 8 coincidence counters, one on each corner of the craft. Positional information is triangulated from the differential signal arrival times at each of the detectors. Positional error would be predominantly determined by timing errors and errors in craft attitude. Since none of the 8 BASTE detectors have any independant angular resolution whatsoever, they can not be used to determine parallax. Indeed, parallax would just add a very small component to the positional error. Demonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would require resolution on the order of arcseconds, since the oort cloud is postulated to extend to about 0.5 parsec (all together now: ""Parallax ARc SECond"", a parsec is the distance of an object that demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a 2 AU base line). If the 3 degree accuracy reported above is true, we're going to have to add a BASTE to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline. The beauty of BASTE is that it both gives positional information and watches the entire sky simultaneously, a realy handy combination when you have no idea where the next burst is coming from. -Kevin",['space']

[Some kinds might work better that others.] (2) Divide the sample into two groups of equal weight and number. (3) Sprout one group in distilled water on filter paper for three or four weeks. (4) Separately incinerate both groups. (5) Weigh the residue from each group. [The residue of the sprouted group will usually weigh at least SEVERAL PERCENT MORE than the other group.] (6) Analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for mineral content. [Some of the mineral atoms of the sprouted group have been TRANSMUTED into heavier mineral elements by FUSING with atoms of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, etc..] BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS occur ROUTINELY, even in our own bodies. Ingesting a source of organic silicon (silicon with carbon, such as ""horsetail"" extract, or radishes) can SPEED HEALING OF BROKEN BONES via the reaction Si + C --> Ca, (much faster than by merely ingesting the calcium directly). Some MINERAL DEPOSITS in the ground are formed by micro- organisms FUSING together atoms of silicon, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, etc.. The two reactions Si + C <--> Ca, by micro-organisms, cause ""STONE SICKNESS"" in statues, building bricks, etc.. The reaction N2 --> CO, catalysed by very hot iron, creates a CARBON-MONOXIDE POISON HAZARD for welder operators and people near woodstoves (even properly sealed ones).

Indeed they were worried about that. One concern was the possibility that they would lose a motor or something on the way up, and make orbit but one that was too low to give HST a useful lifetime against atmospheric drag. I believe the decision was to deploy HST even if the projected lifetime was as short as six months. In fact we got an excellent orbit, on the upper envelope of what the Shuttle can do. I have never heard of any serious consideration that HST might be brought down for refurbishment. You would have the horrendous cost of transporting, cleaning, re-testing, and re-certifying all the hardware on the ground, in addition to the lost observing time and the cost of a second deployment mission with the risks that we might not get such a good orbit the second time. And, you would probably STILL need a (third) servicing mission in a few years as gyros and other components wear out.

This is good when and if we go > for Mars (the MArs mission can act as either Mother ship or relay point for the > probes. I can't see the need for a single (big? expensive? heavy?) ""mothership"" except for Voyager style flyby missions. A few years ago, I did some calculations on a ""Grand Tour"" space probe launched by a Saturn V in 1975-76. At the time,I felt that the idea of a big ""mother ship"" had some merit - the Voyagers had to be rather small, lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak Titan III/Centaur launchers. The concept I examined (and Michael's?) had a lot in common with the British Interplanetary Society's Daedalus project for sending a probe to Barnard's Star - i.e. a large ""bus"" spacecraft carrying several smaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination. The Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towards Jupiter and beyond. The ""bus"" could have included far more powerful cameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power source than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore. Extremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurements within a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter, and usually at a relatively great distance. --- The smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the ""real"" Voyagers, and an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto in the early 21st century, and would have been released at various points during the mission. The advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out the same basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did, but in addition two ""sub-probes"" could have been relased at Saturn, examining that planet's south polar regions before moving on to Pluto. This would have enabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986...and several other probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune systems that weren't examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to trajectory-related factors. A small ""swarm"" of camera-equipped miniature space probes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a small Voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy, well-equipped spacecraft. And would we have learned a lot more about the outer planets! The reason why the Grand Tour was cancelled was lack of money, of course.

David gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic, 'edged' distribution, to whit, they are either part of the Universe or part of the Oort cloud. Why couldn't they be Earth centred, with the edge occuring at the edge of the gravisphere? I know there isn't any mechanism for them, but there isn't a mechanism for the others either. What on Earth is the ""gravisphere""? Anyway, before it's decay the Pioneer Venus Orbiter had a gamma ray detector, as does Ulysses, they detect the brightest bursts that the Earth orbit detectors do, so the bursts are at least at Oort cloud distances. In principle four detectors spaced out by a few AU would see parallax if the bursts are of solar system origin. _The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have to involve new physics as far as I can tell.

I haven't read enough of either to comment, although >everyone tells me I should read Nietzche. I would have to say that the ""greatest philosopher"" title would have to go to Plato since the whole enterprise of philosophy was essentially defined by him. Although he got most of his answers wrong, he did definitively identify what the important questions are. I think it was Descartes who said that ""All philosophy is just a footnote to Plato."" If I were to choose which philosopher made the most important advances in human knowledge over his lifetime, that's simple...it is Aristotle. This is so much the case that many simply refer to him as ""the philosopher"". Regarding Nietzsche, he's one of the most entertaining, although since his ideas were so fragmented (and since his life was cut short) it is doubtful that his influence as a philosopher is likely to be very extensive 500 years from now. They'll probably still be reading him in 500 years though. As for ""modern"" philosophers, I would have to say that Kant was the most influential since he had such a strong influence on almost everyone who came after him (and unfortunately, they maintained his errors and amplified them over time). I would say that the most influential ""american"" philosopher would have to be Dewey. But as to the question of what philosopher will be most highly regarded in 500 years, it may very well be Ayn Rand (who in every important respect was ""American"", but was born in Russia).

Space advertisement in LOW Earth Orbit is very short term -- on the order of a few years before the orbit decays. (Higher orbits last longer.) Advertisers will certainly be aware of the environmental aspects of their advertising. Fred's argument is roughly akin to saying that it's bad to cut down trees, so we shouldn't advertise in newspapers. Think that through, Fred. Picture this: Our space billboard is a LARGE inflatable structure, filled with ""bio-degradable"" foam instead of gas. It scoops up space debris as it orbits, thus CLEANING the space environment and bringing you The Pause That Refreshes at the same time. Because of the large drag coefficient, it will de-orbit -- safely burning up -- within a year. Embedded in the foam structure is a small re-entry vehicle, which does not burn up during entry. It contains the electronics and propulsion system (which may be refurbished and re-used) as well as space science experiments proposed and built by high school students in advertiser-sponsored science fairs. Advertisers buy time on the billboard, whose surface is made up of tiny mirrors controlled by the avionics package. The avionics can reconfigure the mirrors to reflect different messages at different parts of the globe. Clever programming allows different languages to every country. During orbital night, the mirrors turn perpendicular to the surface, and small lights are revealed.

Well, there are several bursts in species diversity I can think of. The Cambrian and Ordovician explosions resulted in a vast increase in animal diversity. Likewise, after the one-two punch of the Permian and Triassic extinctions, the number of marine animals rose steadily (**) to an all-time high (*) just prior to the spread of humans. (**) biggest exception being the K/T (bye bye dinos) extinction (*) about 800 families Also, plants arose from green algae and colonized the land in succesive sweeps. Mosses colonized very wet environments first, ferns (who had evolved vascular tissues) took over more territory when they evolved (1). These were eventually (mostly) replaced by gymnosperms (pines and the like) (2) and then (mostly) displaced by angiosperms (flowering plants -- now the dominant plant group on the planet(3). Fungi also radiated greatly with the invasion of the land. (1) around the carboniferous (up to about 200 families) (2) around the triassic (up to maybe 250 families) (3) starting in the cretaceous (rising to about 600 families currently) It's unclear (to me at least) what the max equilibrium number of species the earth can hold (***) and if it has ever hit this in the past. It could be (warning: speculation alert) that diversity has never reached a peak because mass extinctions happen often enough to keep the total number down. (***) This would depend a great deal on how fragmented specific ecosystems were.

It's true that a hydraulically pressurized tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressurized tube, but even at 2000 PSI levels a hydraulic hose will bend rather easily, though it's straight-on compressive strength is high, and it's torsional resistance increase is practically nil. On the other grasping member, there's no doubt that hydraulic ""leverage"" exists in nature. Tree roots are an example.

Kangaroos 3-limbed? I don't think so. If you take the view that the tail is a limb, then monkeys and kangaroos are 5-limbed. I think the tail is a different kind of structure, grossly enlarged in the case of the kangaroo, but primarily still an instrument of balance rather than locomotion. I don't know much about panda ""thumbs"", so I'll ask is it opposable? >>Thermodynamic considerations of surface/volume relationships would >>seem to dictate that active complex creatures stay in a size range >>similar to what we see about us. 6 inch tall intelligent aliens >>seem unlikely, as do those much larger than the elephant. > >Why can't a lemur or a brontosaurus* be intelligent? > >[*Yes, I know that the brontosaurus is a mythical beast produced by >putting the head of another dinosaur on an apatosaurus, but so far >space aliens are also mythical.] Well I won't say flat out that they can't be intelligent, but I'll bring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why I don't think it's likely. First let me say that when I say ""intelligent"" I mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level with, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. IE assuming suitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter it's enviroment in a planned way, it will do so. That's certainly not a universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will suffice for a putative technological alien. Now no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, but it's generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level of complexity. This is generally determined by the number of neuron cells, and their interconnections. So a creature the size of a lemur wouldn't have enough neurons to support complex thought. This argument is considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. There's room for a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. One reason this may be true is neuronic speed. The electrochemical messages that trigger neurons require time to propagate. This makes it difficult for a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very large creatures. So there's little selection pressure for such brains. Instead, a simpler distributed network evolves. This doesn't rule out intelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction. Then there are the thermodynamic arguments. A tiny creature like the lemur needs to eat frequently because it's internal heat is rapidly lost due to it's high surface to volume ratio. I contend that a creature that must spend most of it's time and energy feeding won't have the time to develop and exercise intelligence. That argument may be somewhat weak. The dinosaur's problem is the reverse, it must moderate it's heat production because it's high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat. I'm assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical reactivity reasons for productive neuron function. So creatures would tend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that of humans if they are carbon based. That tends to rule out cold blooded creatures as potential homes of intelligence. Some people contend that some of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. But for a creature the size of a brontosaur, it's activity levels would have to be restrained or it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the waste heat. Whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to the ocean, a much more efficient sink than air. I suspect that for intelligence to manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with the environment is necessary. IE monkey curiousity. I doubt a large dinosaur would be capable of that much activity.

That's fine idea, but it only works if the lighting/power company even bothers to supply good light fixtures. For instance, a power company in Virginia recently asked a state commission for permission to sell more lights of various type. Yet, all of the different fixture that they sold and wanted to sell were bad designs - one that wasted the light. Thus, you couldn't even buy a good light from them. In most places, to get a good light, you have to either order it special at high cost or call a store in Arizona. At some point, society starts to make rules. Cars have to pass safety tests. Companies have to meet pollution standards, etc.. There are two ways to achieve this: educate the public so that they demand good lighting or force code down the lighting companies backs. History seems to suggest that the latter is more likely to work. > >Please note that I'm not defending light pollution.

I'm worried by the concern about it though, for a number of reasons that have nothing to do with Space Advertising (which for a number of reasons is probably doomed to fail on financial grounds). (And I've been reading and (and writing) this thread since way back when it was only on sci.space). For starters, I don't think the piece of light-pollution apparatus would be as bright as the full moon. _That_ seems to me to be a bit of propaganda on the part of opponents, or wishful thinking on the part of proponents. Second, this charge of ruining the night sky permanently has been levelled against other projects, that either 1) don't increace light pollution significantly, or 2) increace light pollution only over the target area. You may or may not recognize #1 as being Solar Power Sattelites. I think it was Josh Hopkins who actually did the math, showing that SPS's weren't that bright after all, ending some two months of frenzied opposition on the part of dark-sky activists and various other types. #2 is mainly projects like the orbiting mirror the CIS tested recently. While slightly more worrisome, I'd like to point out that any significant scattering of light outside the target area for one of these mirrors would be wasted as far as the project would be concerned, and something any project like that would work against anyway. And given some of the likely targets, I don't think there's going to be much of an outcry from the inhabitants. There is too much dark sky in the northern CIS during the winter, and I doubt you'll find many activists in Murmansk demanding the ""natural"" sky back. If anything, he'll probably be inside, stripped buck naked in front of the UV lamp, making sure he'll get enough vitamin D for the ""day."" The mirror experiments aren't something they're doing for crass advertising. They think that if they can build one, it'll be one of those things people in the affected areas will think they couldn't have lived without before.

From what I understand from Dr. Frank Six of the Marshall Space Flight Center there is no insrmountable problem in bringing HST back. IT was designed that way to begin with. Also it is my understanding that the solar arrays WILL be one of the items replaced on this mission. The originals were built by Brit Aerospace and I think the new ones are too.

I don't have a calculator, but I DO have the problem set that we did not too long ago, so I'll use that, and hope it's what you wanted. This is a highly simplified problem, with a very simple burst. Bursts are usually more complex than this example I will use here. Our burst has a peak flux of 5.43E-6 ergs cm^-2 sec^-1 and a duration of 8.95 seconds. During the frst second of the burst, and the last 4 seconds, its flux is half of the peak flux. It's flux is the peak flux the rest of the time. Assume that the background flux is 10E-7 erg cm^-2 sec^-1. Then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst, for several different spheres: R=.25pc(Oort Cloud Radius), R=22.5pc(at the edge of the galaxy), R=183.5pc or the edge of the galactic corona, and lastly at a R=8800Mpc. We integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence, then used the old standby formula: Luminosity=4(pi)(r^2)Fpeak For a radius of .25 pc, we found an L around 10^32 erg/sec. Pretty energetic for close by. for the coronal model, we found around 10^43 erg/sec. And lastly, for the cosmological model an L=10^53. That's what you'd call moderately energetic, I'd say. Any suggestions about what could put out that much energy in one second? -jeremy",['space']

Lines: 81 Organization: Space Telescope Science Institute Distribution: na >Newsgroups: sci.astro,sci.space >Subject: Re: Vandalizing the sky. > My apologies if this is a re-post - I submitted it on Friday, but got a message that my post might not have gone out. Considering the confusing spitting contest over 'rights', (there are TOO inalienable rights damn it! The majority can be just as destructive of liberty as a despot), I suspect that my post did not get out of my site. (I ain't saying that dark skies are included in these rights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.) Anyway, here are my thoughts on this: I'd like to add that some of the ""protests"" do not come from a strictly practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for research activities by professional astronomers. Some of what I would complain about is rooted in aesthetics. Many readers may never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - unsullied by the actions of humans. The space between the stars as profoundly black as an abyss can be. With full horizons and a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men. Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief in an afterlife. The Space Age changed all that. The effect of the first Sputniks and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once. To see a light crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe. But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight. I have to live in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly. The impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped into shape by the hands of man. In some places the only life forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels (or rats). I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains one weekend, ""getting away from it all"" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 miles to the east. (Their 'security light' didn't help matters much either.) But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of high air traffic. So I know the skies are rarely perfect. But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't fouled in some way. (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!) I don't watch commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high. If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life. To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at 8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the local meridian from Baltimore vicinity. I'll be trying to see it if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all. So I suppose I could be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky while complaining about billboards proposed by others. Be that as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. Regards, Wm. Hathaway Baltimore MD (P.S. added Tuesday - this again is not a rights/vs./reality tome, just a warning that someone into destroying beauty had better know that other people may not accept it without a complaint.)",['space']
