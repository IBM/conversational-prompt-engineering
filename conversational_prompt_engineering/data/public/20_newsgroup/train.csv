I can't imagine the FAA allowing >people to shoot rockets up through the flight levels of passenger planes. >Not to even mention the problem of locating a rocket when it comes down. Nope, it's not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be one of the following: a) An employee of a government agency. b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets. c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in research or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations: The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry. Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own. The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are: - Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the location, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL. - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft within the operating radius around the launch site. - Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited. - The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time. Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year) are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the western deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground). The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members' use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is from 50 to 500 or more feet. By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an ""F"" motor are exempt from most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart C, for details. As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to 50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical rocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute, or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry either a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches in the eastern US, where there are more obstructions. Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common. >And no, I'm not going to even think of buying one. I'm not that crazy. Why not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets for information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything bigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to practice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs takeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact. >-Paul ""mine'll do 50,000 feet and carries 50 pounds of dynamite"" Dokas That's another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESE ROCKETS. NONE! Please forgive me for shouting, but that's one of the biggest misconceptions people have about our hobby. >/* Just remember, you *WILL* die someday. */ True.

I would just like to point out that it is much easier to place an object at orbital altitude than it is to place it with orbital velocity. For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth, you need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s. Assuming that rockets with specific impulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dry weight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer. A small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand or birdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would be the payload. I am sure the whole project is well within the capability of the amateur rocketry community. It sounds like a good Science Fair project--'Reduction of Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics'. Or, it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussed here: $1 billion for the first person to spend 1 year on the moon, $1 million for the first erradication of an orbital eyesore/CCD burner. I wouldpledge $1000 for the first person to bring it down, and I am sure there are at least 999 other astronomers, nature lovers, or just plain people of good taste who would do likewise. Of course, a Gerald Bull solution might be simpler.

April 23, 1993 (Phone: 202/358-1780) Kyle Herring Johnson Space Center, Houston (Phone: 713/483-5111) RELEASE: 93-76 HUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS The December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to service the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 day mission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability for an additional two, if needed. The decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, was reached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times required using the Shuttle's robot arm based on software simulations and actual EVA tasks on previous missions. ""Basically what we've done by going to five EVAs rather than three is to repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the dynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks,"" Mission Director Randy Brinkley said. ""It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added flexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations."" In laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the spacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays and the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives during the mission. ""When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through lowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays, WF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each spacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate,"" said Milt Heflin, Lead Flight Director for the mission. While the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two alternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than previous missions requiring two, three or four EVAs. ""We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous spacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,"" Heflin said. ""In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to formulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible to accomplish the mission objectives."" Planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions that include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated simulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours. In addition, many stand alone underwater training ""runs"" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk. Various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be made based on actual training experience during the months prior to the mission. Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight will be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques. Endeavour's June flight and Discovery's July mission both will include spacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission. The evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the actual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala. Also, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining further insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the experience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and trainers. Designed to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with grapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures. The telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990. At that time the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in 1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have become necessary. - end - ___ _____ ___ /_ /| /____/ \ /_ /| Ron Baalke | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ /| | | | Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/ | | |__ M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | | ___/ | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/ |_|/ |_____|/ | part vegetable."

Please spread the word! Here's some information about the events, and then a couple of messages from Jay Goguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to learn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus. He might also have some money available... John Spencer, 1993/04/21 Iapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn's rings and Saturn itself on 1993/05/01-02 (18:27-13:43 UT) and again on 1993/07/20-21, (21:16-09:38 UT). Timing is as follows; 1993 May 1-2 A-ring ingress 18:27 egress 19:30 B-ring ingress 19:51 egress 21:42 C-ring egress 23:00 Saturn ingress 23:59 egress 10:02 B-ring ingress 10:28 egress 12:19 A-ring ingress 12:40 egress 13:43 1993 July 20-21 Saturn ingress 21:16 egress 05:08 A-ring ingress 05:13 (grazing) egress 09:38 Times could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris, and photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus' orbit. Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from Iapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about the rings themselves from the observations. See Soma (1992), Astronomy and Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details. Thanks to Andy Odell of Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my attention. THERMAL OBSERVATIONS? Jay Goguen (jdg@scn5.Jpl.Nasa.Gov) writes: To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia, etc. Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible, except from Russia. Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3 airmasses at 23:00 UT. Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something to do? I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data. Jay and again: please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths. My impression would be that it's not an easy observation. Iapetus will be faint and getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation. I don't think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are well placed for observation. We need SOFIA for this one. One possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m. jay ___ _____ ___ /_ /| /____/ \ /_ /| Ron Baalke | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ /| | | | Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/ | | |__ M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | | ___/ | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/ |_|/ |_____|/ | part vegetable."
"From: baez@guitar.ucr.edu (john baez) Subject: End of the Space Age Article-I.D.: galaxy.29034 Organization: University of California, Riverside Lines: 82 Nntp-Posting-Host: guitar.ucr.edu There is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today's LA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1). I thought I'd post it to stir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate. Let me preface it by saying that I largely agree that the ""Space Age"" in the romantic sense of several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station miss the point at this time. Reading, for example, ""What's New"" - the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that the romance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of matter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things people are doing with individual atoms these days. To a large extent, I think, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of nostalgia. I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our ""mind children"" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but I think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about what we can do *now*. Anyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all... SPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW Micheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT) At 35, America's Space Age won't have to suffer through the angst of a midlife crisis. The reason is that the Space Age is already dead. The technologies no longer define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion -dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic rewards. Space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America's science and technology debate into a peripheral issue. Speace is not a meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion policy. To be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies for telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes would be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of scientific and industrial innovation is now dead. ..... Before the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to write an obituary for the Space Age. The Bush White House aggressively supported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion to build space station Freedom alone. Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains, Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken public champion of big-ticket space expenditures. The reality that much of the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope to the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively implemented did not seem to matter much. Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent vision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar space budgets. Indeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo era is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more. ...... While the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel Goldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being positioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America's technological prowess. The space station budget has - rightly - been slashed. Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions its competitiveness agenda. ...... ""I wish this had happened 10 years ago instead of starting to happen now,"" says Bruce Murray, a Caltech professor who ran NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena. ""We've put off a lot of things we shouldn't have.... I would rather see a $10-billion NASA doing well than a $40-billion one filled with white elephants."""

Would >this mixing be substantially faster/slower at the pressures we're >talking about? There was an interesting article in Scientific American some time ago about breathing liquid. (It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.) As far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid: - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own breathing effort (let alone anything else) - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?) So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out. - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough gas per unit volume. Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs or interfere with their healing or anything like that... -- Wim Lewis, wiml@u.washington.edu"

In other words, perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology (life support, navigation, etc.) could be developed prior to a low cost launch system. You wouldn't want to use the expensive stuff forever, but I'd hate to see folks waiting to do anything until a low cost Mac, oops, I mean launch system comes on line. I guess I'd simplify this to say that 'waste' is a slippery concept. If your goal is manned lunar exploration in the next 5 years, then perhaps its not 'wasted' money. If your goal is to explore the moon for under $500 million, then you should put of this exploration for a decade or so.

If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo, but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than just a ""we have the money, why not?"" approach. Ah, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not wasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) bills to fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be spent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of funding high-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various fields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the defense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to fund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European cooperation. Now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of money (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as investment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at the size of that multiplier :->).
