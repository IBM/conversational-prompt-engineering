"From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org Subject: Boeing TSTO (Was: Words from Chairman of Boeing) X-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993 Lines: 83 games@max.u.washington.edu writes: Re; Response from CoB of Boeing on SSTO ... >""As far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have >a better answer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some >of our customers about that.

Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried out extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some time. A good reference on this might be: ""Comparison of Propulsion Options for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92- 0639)."" by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing. The paper describes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve aircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems associated with liquid hydrogen fuel. Basically, it's a high-speed airplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane The design (the concept is also called ""Beta"") as laid out in the paper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000 pounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and life support. System design reliability is .9995. Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets and 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans. A 108-foot- long reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first- stage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy payload on an expendable second stage. To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a normal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3. At that point the turbofans, modified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets, would take over. At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing out, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like aircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions. Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff is about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225. The orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbs of LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust rocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin, with the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by- 25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would be stored aft. Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design's success is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact tankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel. The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design. They conclude while a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier, cheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater safety and mission versatility and doesn't carry the hard-to-handle and bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude ""In conjunction with its major use of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self- ferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide as close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical configuration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can be shown to be operationally viable."" >Is this really news? Does this threaten further work on DC-? Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for some time. I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL SSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re- examined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter. Does it threaten DC-???. Possibly -- There is a set of on-going studies trying straighten out the government's future space transportation strategy. MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms) are providing data to a joint study team back in DC. There are various factions and options vying for attention -- including shuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the ""4-2-3"" architecture), SpaceLifter, ELV upgrades, and various advanced vehicles (ALES, Beta, DC-??, NASP, FSTS, SSTOs of several types, etc.) NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy for future US gov't space transportation systems, and trying to juggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) against medium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and against the investment and risk of going to ""leap frog"" new technologies like SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta. It's a heck of a problem. The worst part of the problem isn't that there aren't promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens of them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in the near term. They should have a draft report in mid-June, with a final report coming by the end of the fiscal year. ------------------------------------------------------------------ Wales Larrison Space Technology Investor --- Maximus 2.01wb"

Only if he doesn't spend more than a billion dollars doing it, since the prize is not going to be scaled up to match the level of effort. You can spend a billion pretty quickly buying Titan launches. What's more, if you buy Titans, the prize money is your entire return on investment. If you develop a new launch system, it has other uses, and the prize is just the icing on the cake. I doubt very much that a billion-dollar prize is going to show enough return to justify the investment if you are constrained to use current US launchers. (There would surely be a buy-American clause in the rules for such a prize, since it would pretty well have to be government-funded.) You're going to *have* to invest your front money in building a new launch system rather than pissing it away on existing ones.

You assume that the general public ""can't handle the truth"" and then, based on this assumption, go for the fluff arguments. Then someone, who can understand a good argument, comes along and asks ""why don't you just develop the spinoffs?"" or ""why can't we just get our spinoffs from some other program, like the military?"" There are some good arguments for space development without relying on its side effects. I'm not ignoring the value of spinoffs. I simply think that the general public deserves more credit than you give them. >BTW: don't forget Velcro... And if you're going to use spinoffs you better make darn sure you are right. Teflon has been around since before NASA. As I understand it, Velcro was conceptualized by a french doctor who went walking in the woods and took the trouble to wonder how burrs stick to your clothes. Certainly velcro was available on hiking equipment by the early to mid sixties.

It may feel strange at first, : but the body does adjust. The feeling is not too different from that : of sky diving. I'm no astronaut, but I've flown in the KC-135 several times. I'll tell you about my first flight. At the on-set of weightlessness, my shoulders lifted and my spine straightened. I felt a momentary panic, and my hands tried to grab onto something (like the strap keeping me firmly against the floor) to prevent me from falling; I remember conciously over-ruling my involuntary motions. My ears felt (not heard) a rush and I could feel fluid moving in my head (like when you get up from bed while you have a cold). At that point, I ceased to concentrate on my physiological response, since I had some science to do. I was busy keeping my experiment going and keeping track of all the parts during the ""return"" of gravity and subsequent 1.8-G pull-out, so I didn't really pay attention to physiology at that time. After about 5 parabolas, I discovered that I was performing one of the tricks I've discovered to keep myself from getting motion sickness; I was keeping my head very still and moving very slowly -- all except my hands and arms, which needed to be in rapid, concious motion for my experiment. During the pull-out to parabola 5, my queasiness finally started to get to me, and I had to use one of those air-sickness bags. I was basically useless for the rest of that flight, so I went to the seats in the back of the plane while my partner (whom I drafted for just this purpose) kept working on the experiment while I was ill. (He was a vetran Vomit Comet rider, one of those anomalous people who don't get sick on the thing.) I didn't think of it as a ""constant sensation of falling"" so much as like swimming in air. It's very close to the sensations I feel when I'm scuba diving and I turn my head down and fins up. Jerry: : >And what is the motion sickness : >that some astronauts occasionally experience?

Henry, if I read you correctly, you may be asking ""If I put a blackbody in interstellar space ('disregarding the Sun and nearby large warm objects'), what termperature will it reach in thermal equilibrium with the ambient radiation field?"" If that's the case, let me point out that interstellar dust and molecules provide many instances of things that are, well, not-too-far from being blackbodies. Many different observations, including IRAS and COBE, have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures can range from 40K to 150K. You might look in a conference proceedings ""Interstellar Processes"", ed. D. J. Hollenbach and H. A. Thronson, Jr., published in 1987. Try the articles by Tielens et al., Seab, and Black.
