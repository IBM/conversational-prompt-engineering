The American Chemistry Council defines this process as: “Different processes to extract value from post-use plastics by converting them into their original building blocks, specialty chemicals, feedstocks for new chemicals and plastics, and other valuable products.”  The plastics and petrochemical industries tout these methods as a green solution to the enormous plastic waste crisis felt globally. Brands like America’s Plastic Makers claim advanced recycling is a viable technique to achieve sustainability and circularity in plastics, where they are “remade into new plastics and can be remade again and again.” In reality, advanced recycling is mainly used to produce fuel, not additional plastics. The process uses an immense amount of energy and creates large amounts of toxic waste, which is often worse for the environment than manufacturing the original plastic, debunking industry claims of advanced recycling being a route to achieve sustainability in plastics. THESE ARE OLD TECHNOLOGIES GREENWASHED TO APPEAR ECO-FRIENDLY - Pyrolysis has been around for centuries. It was used in the 1600s to make tar from timber, and in the 20th century to make coke from coal. Although more recently applied specifically to plastic, using this technology to burn waste (including plastic waste) has been explored since the 1950s. This technology has struggled to be implemented at scale for decades. BP attempted waste-to-fuel pyrolysis over 20 years ago without commercial or technical success. As of November 16, 2023, there were 11 constructed plants in the US. If all 11 of these plants operated at full capacity, which is not the case, they would process less than 1.3% of plastic waste generated annually in the US. Advanced recycling plants have been repeatedly proven to be not financially viable. By 2017, at least $2 billion in investments were lost due to the fragile revenue models and high operation costs of these recycling plants that ultimately led to their cancellation or failure. NO MATTER HOW THE INDUSTRY SPINS IT – COMBUSTION IS HAPPENING - Proponents of chemical recycling claim that oxygen is removed from the chamber in the facility that is pyrolyzing the plastic, and therefore the facilities are not burning materials and are not incinerators. In reality, the vast majority of plastics are made from fossil fuels, and the plastic feedstock that these facilities process use oxygen and combustion, even in pyrolysis and gasification chambers. Because of this, the plants produce toxic char, liquid effluent (waste), and emissions. For every ton of plastic, nearly three tons of CO2 are emitted in plastic-to-fuel operations. In 2023, the US environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reiterated that these facilities are classified as incinerators and must adhere to Section 129 of the Clean Air Act. Chemical recycling process - Chemical Recycling: A Dangerous Deception - International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN) - New chemical recycling plants are typically proposed in areas with legacy industry pollution, such as the SOBE pyrolysis plant proposed for Youngstown, OH. The Ohio EPA found the three-mile area around the proposed facility was in the 80th percentile or higher for various types of air pollution as well as a poverty level of 35%, according to EPA’s environmental justice screening tool. THESE FACILITIES RELEASE TOXIC POLLUTION - Advanced recycling, during its burning process, releases carcinogens, neurotoxicants, cardiovascular toxicants, and numerous other hazardous pollutants. Additionally, early research into the fuels produced from the advanced recycling process suggests the plastic-based oils are worse for the climate than extracting crude oil. This is due to pyrolysis, which contributes more greenhouse gas emissions than conventional drilling. The toxins released from the advanced recycling process are shown to have extreme health effects, including harming reproductive health and causing respiratory and neurological cancers. The environmental effects are just as extreme. A study published by the American Chemical Society found the economic and environmental metrics pyrolysis and gasification, including water use, energy use, waste generation, greenhouse gas emissions, and toxicity are 10-100 times higher than virgin polymers because of their low-yield outputs and high-energy inputs. YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE - Communities all over the country are stepping up to share the real risks of petrochemicals, including advanced/chemical “recycling” facilities. Consider joining your local Climate Reality chapter and speaking to your neighbors about the potential harms of this greenwashed industry.""CLIMATE REALITY CHAPTERS ARE FIGHTING FOR A CLIMATE-SMART FARM BILL -- The Climate Reality Regenerative Agriculture Coalition (RAC) got its start in the middle of 2022 to focus on advocacy efforts for the 2023 Farm Bill, which was supposed to be voted into law by the end of September 2023. The bill has since been delayed, due in large part to divides among members of the US House of Representatives and Senate agriculture committees. The points of contention revolve around climate mitigation requirements (called “guardrails”) that were part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) signed into law in August 2022. Legislators remain in stark disagreement over the inclusion of climate guardrails in the new 2024 Farm Bill. The RAC is composed of over 190 advocates from 30-plus Climate Reality chapters across the US, supporting regenerative agriculture (RA) practices and policies that would help reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the agriculture industry, benefit farmers and ranchers, and improve soil health while promoting carbon sequestration capabilities. The RAC developed six policy recommendations that supported these initiatives and met with many Congressional staff members during 2023 to garner support for the Farm Bill and IRA. It all began with the establishment of the regenerative agriculture campaign committee as part of the Chicago Metro chapter. At that time, RA practices and methods were not well-known to the public. It was before nature-based solutions became an area of focus for Climate Reality chapters. The primary reason members of the Chicago Metro chapter decided to start the campaign was because of the potential of regenerative agricultural practices to draw down carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and sequester carbon in the ground through photosynthesis. This is a revolutionary concept that demands attention if we are to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis. RA can definitely be a complex process. The Chicago Metro chapter RA committee spent six months learning about how RA works and why it’s needed. We continue to research and study the potential of RA to mitigate climate change using this holistic, regenerative land management approach. This includes practices and methods like no-tilling and planting cover crops (e.g. winter rye) to improve soil health and reduce erosion. This is how nature-based solutions can create healthy soil that feeds the plants and reduce the need for chemical fertilizers that end up polluting our environment. In the middle of 2022, the Denver Metro Colorado chapter joined the Chicago Metro chapter in starting the RA Coalition to broaden and further our impact in advocating for climate mitigation provisions in the Farm Bill. The entire team is passionate about this. We are committed to advocating for the benefits of RA within our chapters and to the broader public. To accomplish our goals, the team builds relationships with other RA farm organizations to support each other’s lobby efforts on the 2024 Farm Bill and IRA. We schedule meetings with our legislators to discuss our policy recommendations and gather support. We raise awareness of RA benefits by inviting experts to speak at chapter meetings, publishing Climate Action Now alerts, developing letter writing campaigns, and doing presentations to inform everyone about RA’s potential and what people can do to support these practices. In 2024, we started a farmer and rancher outreach campaign that included a survey questionnaire to ask participants to tell their RA success stories for use in podcast videos and social media and in meetings with members of Congress. This campaign is ongoing, and we look forward to spreading the word about RA benefits and the potential to mitigate climate change. Most people don’t realize that atmospheric CO2 levels and global temperatures may still be dangerously high even after getting to net-zero emissions. Expanding RA practices is one way to help reduce the excess CO2 and reverse global warming, saving the planet for generations to come. I’m really proud of everyone on the RAC and Chicago Metro chapter teams. Each member has developed subject matter expertise on RA practices, allowing us to advocate for responsible Farm Bill legislation. We will continue to lobby Congress to add climate-smart RA policies to the 2024 Farm Bill and other agriculture-related legislation.

This spring, billions of cicadas will emerge in the US due to a rare “double-brood” event. Both broods – one that lives on a 13-year-cycle and another that lives on a 17-year-cycle – will emerge from underground at the same time. The last time these two broods emerged simultaneously was in 1803. That’s 221 years ago. In the south, at sites from North Carolina to Georgia, cicadas are already starting to emerge. In one South Carolina county, they were so loud that concerned residents called the sheriff’s office. The Northern Illinois Brood, which is on a 17-year-cycle, is predicted to emerge in the next month. It is well-documented that climate change can impact ecosystems in a variety of ways. From where species live and the timing of biological events to the rates of species extinction, climate is an important environmental influence on our natural world. But how do rising global temperatures impact these insects? Will cicadas start to emerge earlier? A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND - Known for their cacophony of buzzing and clicking noises, cicadas are well-known for emerging from underground en masse – and then disappearing four to six weeks later. While there are more than 3,000 species of cicadas, they generally fall into two camps: annual cicadas, which are seen on a yearly basis, and periodical cicadas, which spend the majority of their lives underground. The lifespans of these two broad categories of cicadas also differ. Annual cicadas generally live for two to five years and periodical cicadas, which are unique to North America, can live for up to 17 years. Once a brood emerges, cicadas “crawl up trees to mate, and the females lay eggs in tree branches.” After they hatch, young cicadas “drop to earth and burrow into the soil.” Then, periodical cicadas will spend either the next 13 or 17 years underground– it depends on the brood – before they emerge again to mate (and so on and so forth). THE MYSTERY OF HOW CICADAS KNOW WHEN TO EMERGE - Cicadas typically emerge when the ground temperature reaches 64°F. They also are cued by the “annual cycles of their host plants.” While underground, juvenile cicadas – called nymphs – live off of root fluids. However, scientists still don’t know how broods manage to emerge at the same time.  If it were only about ground temperature, cicadas would come out in small groups and would be “quickly wiped out by predators” because, for example, a cicada that happens to be a couple of feet underground will experience cooler temperatures than one closer to the surface. In the US, cicadas typically emerge around late April or May in the South and late May to early June in the North. As our planet warms, spring will begin to arrive earlier, and among many other impacts, University of Connecticut researchers predict that warming temperatures “will lead to an increase in unexpected, oddly-timed emergences, and, in the extreme, a breakdown of periodicity in these insects.” Warming temperatures could cause periodical broods of cicadas to come out earlier in the spring. In fact, it wouldn’t be a first-time occurrence. In the springs of 2020 and 2023, for example, “a smattering of confused cicadas belonging to Brood XIII and Brood XIX were spotted” after emerging off-cycle. Although scientists aren’t entirely able to predict the impacts of climate change on periodical cicadas, it’s possible that because this past winter was unusually warm in some regions and extremely cold in others, we may see cicadas emerge at different times across the country. The mystery of how and when cicadas determine when to emerge – and the role of rising global temperatures – persists. WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT RISING GLOBAL TEMPERATURES? While how cicadas determine when to emerge remains one of nature’s greatest mysteries, they are far from the only ones that are affected by our shifting climate. In fact, it’s already happening. For example, one new study found that as climate change causes spring to arrive earlier, migratory birds are struggling to adapt. Last year, white butterflies filled Johannesburg’s skies earlier than usual. Bears are waking up early from hibernation, or struggling to hibernate at all. The list goes on. The climate crisis is flipping the script and throwing our natural systems out of balance. As heat waves and other forms of extreme weather become more frequent and even more dangerous, people are being impacted, too.""HOW THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS IMPACTING ITALY -- The climate crisis is intensifying extreme weather events like heat waves, droughts, floods, and storms all around the world. These events damage property, disrupt lives and livelihoods, and can even be deadly. Italy is one country that’s on the front lines of extreme weather events and other impacts due to the climate crisis – and it’s having a cascading impact on the European nation, affecting everything from public health to agriculture and infrastructure. RISING TEMPERATURES - Average annual temperatures in Italy have risen by 1 degree Celsius in the last 100 years, according to the International Energy Agency, with an even faster increase in recent decades. This warming has been especially prevalent in the spring and summer, at high altitudes, and has resulted in more and more heat waves baking the peninsula. Indeed, heat waves have become a major, pressing concern for Italy as our climate continues to change. Last summer, a heat wave the Italian Meteorological Society named “Cerberus” – the  three-headed monster from Dante’s “Inferno” – baked Italy with temperatures soaring past 45°C (113° Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. The long-lasting “heat dome” became so intense that Italy’s health ministry “issued a red alert (meaning ‘risk of death’) in 27 cities,” CNN reports. Important tourism centers like Rome, Florence, and Bologna were among them. Later that same summer (2023), in northern Italy, Milan posted its highest average daily temperature in 260 years. Heat waves have a severe impact on public health, worker safety, and infrastructure, in Italy and beyond. They cause a significant rise in heat-related illnesses and deaths, particularly among vulnerable populations like the elderly, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions. Working outdoors during extreme heat is especially dangerous. In 2022, over 18,000 heat-related fatalities were reported in Italy. In total, 61,672 deaths across Europe were attributed to the heat in what was said to be Europe’s hottest summer on record. High temperatures and dry conditions (more on that below) are also creating the perfect conditions for wildfires, damaging property and ecosystems and creating poor air quality. At least four people died across southern Italy and on the island of Sicily in 2023 as numerous fires burned across the Mediterranean region – something that has become an unfortunate yearly phenomenon. And at the same time, while air conditioning isn't as common in Italy as it is in some other countries, use is growing, putting a strain on energy grids and even leading to blackouts in major cities like Rome as people try to stay cool amid the increasingly oppressive temperatures. The story of extreme heat and Italy looks increasingly dire – unless we take fast action to slash emissions. If the world continues on a high-emissions pathway, by 2050, average annual temperatures in Italy could increase by as much as 2.4°C, making extreme weather events like the heat waves and wildfires the country is currently seeing even more frequent and severe. WATER WOES - Increased temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns are causing more frequent droughts in some parts of Italy, while other regions experience extreme flooding. This creates major disruptions for agriculture, water supplies, and even energy generation. Drought, in particular, has become a growing problem for Italy in recent years. “The drought that hit northern Italy in 2022 was unprecedented in more than two centuries, and is part of a long-term trend of more frequent and severe drought in the area,” Nature writes. The year 2022 was particularly severe, with the Po River, Italy's longest and most vitally important river, experiencing record low water levels. This dry-out, in turn, put as much as 40% of Italy’s agriculture sector in jeopardy. Italian agriculture is a crucial sector for the economy and national identity – and reduced water availability because of drought harms crops and leads to harvest losses and economic hardship for farmers. The 2022 drought in northern Italy alone caused as much as €6 billion ($6.5 billion US) in agricultural damage and jeopardized thousands of farms. Also impaired by water shortages, particularly in mighty rivers like the Po: electricity generation. Hydropower is a significant source of energy in Italy, providing nearly one-fifth of the nation’s energy demands. When droughts reduce water flow in rivers, hydropower generation capacity suffers – in Italy, “From January to May 2022, hydro production fell by about 40 percent compared to the corresponding period in 2021,” according to AFP (via Phys.org). This can worsen energy shortages more broadly, especially when it comes at a time when it’s combined with other factors – like Italy’s desire to cut back on its dependence on Russian gas following that nation’s invasion of Ukraine. Looking ahead, experts predict that droughts will likely become more frequent and intense in Italy due to the climate crisis. Alongside the agricultural and energy generation-related impacts discussed above, these dry conditions will also further increase the risk of wildfires like those the nation has seen the last several years. On the flip side of this particular coin, “climate change’s all-or-nothing weather extremes” have meant that some areas of Italy have experienced deadly flooding at the same time that others have remained parched. “The coastal region of Emilia-Romagna was struck twice, first by heavy rain two weeks ago on drought-parched ground that could not absorb it, causing rivers to overflow overnight, followed by this week’s deluge that killed 14 and caused damages estimated in the billions of euros,” the AP News writes. “In a changing climate, more rain is coming, but it’s falling on fewer days in less useful and more dangerous downpours.” This dynamic of precipitation extremes is likely to only be amplified across Italy as our world  continues to warm. SEA LEVEL RISE - Italy is a peninsula and island nation, with 7,600 km (about 4,700 miles) of coastline – the fifth longest in Europe and 14th longest in the world. It touches the Mediterranean, Ionian, and Adriatic seas. And sea levels are rising. Why? It’s simple: As humans burn more and more fossil fuels, the world is getting warmer, leading glaciers and land ice in places like Greenland and West Antarctica to break apart and melt. The melted ice becomes water that flows into the oceans, and all that extra water then causes sea levels to rise. Sea level rise for Italy has been estimated at 1.64 millimeters (0.06 inches) per year since 1903. By 2050, under a low-emissions scenario, sea levels in Italy may rise 0.18 meters (more than half a foot) and as much as 0.23 meters under a high-emissions scenario. This increase in sea levels has been most acutely felt in one of Italy’s most historic (and important to tourism) cities: Venice. Venice is made up of over 118 small islands and sits in a lagoon in the Adriatic Sea. And at the same time that seas are rising, the city is sinking. The city is built on an unstable foundation – one that is naturally subsiding. “The foundations of Venice's buildings are constructed using a system of piles,” the BBC writes, “long lengths of timber that are pushed vertically into the loose mud and clay of the lagoon below. The solid bedrock of the lagoon is far further below the surface than this mud, so the foundations are being pushed into a more substantial, but still slightly vulnerable, layer of compressed clay.” Venice has also experienced a natural phenomenon called “acqua alta” (high water) – periods where the city has flooded temporarily at different times in the year – during high tides for centuries. But rising sea levels are making these events more frequent and severe. Areas that flooded occasionally in the past are now underwater more and more often, damaging buildings and infrastructure. In a city famous for its beautiful and historic buildings, saltwater intrusion from rising seas is further damaging structures, leading to costly repairs – and a potential loss of cultural heritage. One event, in November 2019, left more than 80% of the city underwater, prompting a state of emergency declaration and creating more than €1 billion euros ($1.1 billion US) in damages. The Italian government has implemented some measures to protect Venice, like the MOSE project, a system of inflatable gates designed to block certain high tides. However, this project has faced delays and cost overruns. The future of Venice is uncertain with rising sea levels. Flooding has become a threat to daily life for many Venetians and could result in economic losses due to lost tourism revenue. It’s even a threat to public health – as use of flood gates at times of particularly high tide could result in sewage being trapped in the lagoon. The city is fighting for its survival and needs innovative and long-term solutions to adapt to this changing environment. WHAT’S NEXT? Looking ahead, experts predict that extreme weather events will likely become even more common and severe in Italy. The impact on the Italian economy could be significant. Without strong action to reduce emissions, Italy's GDP could shrink by 3.7% by 2050 due to factors like damage from extreme weather and disruptions to key sectors like agriculture and tourism. That number rises to 8.5% by 2100 without swift climate action. Italy is taking steps to address climate change, but much more needs to be done to mitigate the worst impacts. Good thing there are numerous potential opportunities for action in the country. From investing in renewable energy and sustainable, efficient infrastructure to climate-resilient agriculture, Italy can create new jobs and stimulate economic growth by acting on climate. The country can position itself as a leader and benefit from the transition to a low-carbon economy. It just has to stand up now for a safer, more sustainable future powered by clean energy.

Emerging countries, especially those in the Global South, also often lack resources to sufficiently adapt to the climate crisis, which increases the risks of greater economic loss and human suffering. At the same time, historically, the world’s high emitters continue to fall short on providing their fair share of climate finance to help these countries adapt to the changes they’ve largely created.
Climate change adaptation finance is financial support for actions that help communities reduce their vulnerability to the impacts of the climate crisis. This can include measures such as building stronger seawalls to protect coastal communities from flooding, developing drought-tolerant crops to help farmers withstand dry spells, and improving early warning systems to give people more time to prepare for extreme weather events.
Adaptation finance can come from a variety of sources, including public sources, such as development aid from governments, private sources like investments from businesses and individuals, and blended finance, which combines public and private resources.
“Adaptation finance can often be very similar to other types of development finance. This is because support aimed at reducing communities’ economic or social vulnerability will often also have a positive impact on their resilience to climate change,” according to the World Resources Institute. “To be counted as adaptation finance, though, funding should be provided with the express intention of enhancing climate resilience, based on analysis of climate risks.”
Emerging countries are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and they need significant financial support to adapt. Current estimates on addressing adaptation financing needs sit at up to $387 billion USD per year until 2030, and it’s no secret that we’ve needed to establish mechanisms to start delivering finance flows to where they are needed most. In 2009, COP 15 in Copenhagen concluded with a commitment of developed countries to mobilize $100 billion USD per year in climate finance to developing countries by 2020. They then extended this commitment through the period 2020-2025. This target has not yet been met – and although it is speculated that it will be met for the first time this year, studies have concluded that the current gap in adaptation financing alone stands between $194 billion USD and $366 billion USD per year.
Adaptation finance is essential to help communities build resilience to climate change and protect people and livelihoods. It is also a sound investment, as it can help to reduce the economic costs of climate change impacts.
Climate change loss and damage refers to the irreversible and unavoidable impacts of climate change that are already happening and will continue to happen in the future. This can include physical losses, such as damage to infrastructure, as well as economic losses, such as crop failure and loss of tourism revenue.
Loss and damage, broadly defined, can include the loss of life and property caused by climate change-exacerbated extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts. It can be damage to infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and buildings caused by sea level rise and extreme weather events, or the loss of biodiversity caused by changes in temperature and precipitation patterns. It also includes the displacement of people from their homes due to climate-related disasters and the loss of agricultural productivity caused by droughts and floods.
Loss and damage is a complex and challenging issue, and there is no single definition that is universally accepted. It is a serious threat to human development and well-being. It can lead to displacement, food insecurity, and loss of livelihood. It can also exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities - the world’s poorest and most climate-vulnerable countries have large populations dependent upon activities impacted by climate change, such as agriculture, forestry, and fishing, as well as the least amount of resources available to build back after disaster.
As it is reported that the poorest countries have contributed the least to the climate crisis while being the most heavily impacted by it, the concept of loss and damage is at its core a climate justice issue – and momentum has been building around how to address it. 
Climate change loss and damage was a major focus at COP 27 in Egypt in November 2022. For the first time, countries agreed to establish a dedicated fund to address the losses and damages caused by climate change in emerging countries. This was a major breakthrough, as it recognized the historical responsibility of developed countries for climate change and the need to provide financial assistance to those countries that are most vulnerable to its impacts.
The decision to establish a loss and damage fund was the result of decades of pressure from developing countries, who have also argued that existing financial mechanisms are not enough to address the full scope of the climate crisis. However, the decision to establish the fund did not come with an immediate influx of monetary pledges by developed countries. Instead, a transitional committee was formed that has been working over the course of the past year to decide how to operationalize the fund – including how it will look, where it will be housed, who will pay into it, where the money will come from, and which countries will benefit. 
The upcoming COP 28 in Dubai is set to conclude with answers to these questions, but the current state of play as of the recent fifth transitional committee meeting is that the fund will be housed within the World Bank on an interim basis for four years, with all developing countries allowed to access the fund’s resources.
