6065,"Undergraduate Student with 0 credit, trying to find a simple way to build it.
I've tried applying for a few student cards, and a department store card and got denied on all four. I talked with my bank, and they can't directly offer me a CC, not even with a cosigner. I'd be an ""authorized user"" but that does not affect my credit one bit.

I don't want to apply for any more cards, so as to not actually get a bad score, as currently I have no score. I was told by my banker that if I applied to too many and was denied too many times, I would eventually ""gain"" a bad score.

I'm not really in the position to be able to get an apartment on my own due to where I live, it would be far too expensive to do. However I do realize that might be a last-resort sort of deal, if need be.

2294,"HELP! how do I get my dog to stop chewing on all my expensive shit????
My dog is a four month old half chihuahua half wirehair terrier mix. She used to be a sweet adorable dog, housebroken, and two weeks ago she got into some sort of manic state and started chewing on everything and pooping on everything. She has ruined two laptop chargers, four cellphone chargers, a whole slew of my daughter's toys (including some toys that used to be mine when i was her age and an expensive parasol my mother bought her) and has recently started getting into my potted plants. I walk her twice a day, feed her well, and she always has water. I work from 8-3 every day but in the afternoon my daughter and I walk her and play with her. I have tried lots of things like putting ""phooey"" on my rug (which she also ruined along with my decorative couch pillows) and keeping her in a crate all day. The problem with crate training is that she cries from the moment i put her in it until the moment i take her out. 

Im at my wits end and sort of desperate. I can't afford to replace this stuff anymore, and if I can't find some sort of remedy soon I am going to take her to the humane society, despite the fact that both my daughter and I love our ""molly wolly."" I just don't know what to do anymore. Please, pet owners of reddit, help a newbie out? I don't know how to make this situation a positive one. Any suggestions?

3884,"Word got out that I [M36] bought my uncle [M61] a new truck. Now I've got other relatives asking for help. Going to be an awkward Thanksgiving!?
Well, I've gotten myself into a really difficult situation and now I'm looking for a way out!

My uncle's driven the same truck for the past 10 years. He's a hardworking guy and has never asked for a handout. He did an awful lot for me growing up so I wanted to do something nice for him as a way to say thank you. I received my bonus a little early this year and decided to surprise him with a new truck. In all the years I've known him, it was the first time I've ever seen the man cry. It was awesome and I'm glad I did it. He deserved it.

Three of my relatives heard that I bought my uncle a new truck, so now they're expecting me to help them out as well. Each of them have a sob story and have been regularly calling and emailing me to see how I'm doing. I'm not stupid, I know they're only being nice because they want money. The problem is, I'm not going to help them. 

We have a huge family, so I know others are going to approach me as well. (They'll probably ask me face to face at Thanksgiving and/or Christmas). Awkward!

Imagine sitting at a huge dining room table and half of the people at table are pissed at you because you won't give them money. Not my idea of fun!

What's the best way to handle this? It's probably inevitable but I don't want to have half of my family pissed off at me. TIA!
","Helped out my uncle, now other relatives want help as well. I have to see all of them for the holidays and I'm not sure how to handle it."
4491,"I want to eventually get back together with my Ex... how do i approach this?
I'm going to post my links from my other posts because theres a lot of information and i dont want to type it all again. if you would like to know more about my situation click on these links:

I'm 25 and I called my ex for the first time since she broke up with me 12 days ago. I really miss her and am very much in love with her. I know shes going through some stuff right now and doesnt need a serious relationship right now. We talked for an hour tonight and it was great. I asked her a couple of times if she needed to go and she always said no. At the end i told her it was good talking to her and she said it was really good talking to me too. She said i guess ill talk to you later, and i told her i'd call her in a few days or something. She seemed happy and said ok.

How do i need to approach this? I dont want to push her away or try to move too quickly. I do want her back in my life.

4035,"I'm supposed to graduate from college this semester but I'm missing one credit.  What should I do?
As the title says, I'm supposed to graduate with a degree in Economics after this semester, but as I transferred to this University 2 years ago, I am supposed to have 60 institutional credits.  Due to me being incompetent and missing the fact that I was supposed to take an extra credit this semester, I will only have 59/60.  

I have started applying for jobs already, but I have a mediocre GPA and am currently trying to expand my repertoire to make myself more marketable (I started taking some computer science classes this semester).  Now I have two options.  1, I could probably get into a 1 credit drum class and fulfill my requirement for this semester.  2, I can wait another semester and take another full load (taking 18 now so I would probably do the same next semester) and hopefully boost my GPA and would have much more math and computer science under my belt for graduation.  I already have a decent amount of math (taken calculus up to Diff Eq and probability, as well as all econometrics courses offered).

What would you guys recommend?

2909,"My [27F] parents [MF50s] are putting me down. Debating to cut them out of my life for a while. Help!
My parents help me pay for school. And I am grateful they also babysit my son. What I do not appreciate is when they tell me to grow up and that I do not have common sense to be a mother. I nearly cried earlier today when I heard my mom bring me down. My parents feel that I should visit them and clean amd help yet demand I commit to my motherly duties while cooking and cleaning for them. I feel like they own me since they pay for my education. I love helping but not if they are rude when it is uncalled for. I really do not live a double life (e.g. party while parenting). I only go to my college classes and straight home to care for my son after I pick him from daycare (or a sitter or my parents' house).

Today was enough. Now I'm debating how to approach this. I'm a parent, college, I clean my home and cook for my 1y. Can I cut off contact with parents for a short while?

434,"Me [21 F] with my sister [19 F], she's severely mentally ill and lashes out at me, parents expect me to just take it
I don't want to write a wall of text here, but basically since my sister was diagnosed with her laundry list of mental illnesses (bipolar disorder, eating disorders, social anxiety, depression, and so on), she's turned to me as her main target of her frustration. 

If I get up for seconds at dinner, she throws her food down and says she's not gonna eat anymore, making me feel guilty for her restricting her food intake. If I want to watch something on TV in the family room and she doesn't like it, she will say something very hurtful to me, throw something, and so on. 

I've tried talking to both of my parents (both in their mid-50s) about this, my father takes the ""she's mentally ill she can do whatever she wants"" kind of route with handling her. He does whatever he can to keep the peace with her, which means he just tells me to ""shut up and take it."" My mom is a little more understanding, but she still blames me for all of the lashing out my sister does at me, even if it's unprovoked (99% of the time it is). 

It's getting to the point that when she sits down next to me I feel that she's going to claw my eyes out, I don't feel safe or welcome at all, and I just sit in my room most nights to avoid her behavior. 

I'm still a student and work part-time, and can't afford to move out, and for the rest of the summer I have to live at home before university starts back up again. What can I do to deal with this situation?

2406,"I [19F] am struggling with pre-existing intimacy problems as I get close to friends now [21F],[20F]
I've always had trouble making and keeping friends. Nothing abnormal, some mild anxiety after bad experiences in middle school. Throughout high school I decided to go it alone and did well with a few friends I would only see and speak to once a week. 

I met my current friends about two years ago. For the past couple of months I've been really stressed and I couldn't figure out why. I think now it's possible that I've become close with them to the point of discomfort. I trust these guys a lot. I care about them, a lot. I've told them things I wouldn't tell anyone. It's felt really good to be able to have that relationship! But I also feel weak and exposed. I feel some deterioration in my self worth. 

The anxiety is coming back to bite me in the ass. They know I have intimacy problems, we've talked about it before. They know I have fears and weaknesses and that just makes me really uncomfortable. I know some things about them as well, but now I'm not the collected and composed person I might have appeared to be before. It's just a really big change and I feel kind of overwhelmed. Also feel like I want to pull back to my comfort zone. If anyone has similar situations/stories to share, please do!
","After years of no real friends I finally have people I care about, but being in an intimate relationship is apparently not in my comfort zone."
2963,"Me [34 M]: I am really bad at casual physical contact... please help!
This problem has plagued me all my off. I just carry myself in a stiff, awkward, kind of clumsy way and I'm bad when it comes to physical touch. 

Sitting next to someone on a couch? My shoulders are hunched, my hands are clasped, my muscles tense like a puma ready to strike!

Someone goes to pat me on the back or touch my shoulder? I instinctively dodge out of the way. 

Hugs? Initially met with a fighting stance before I finally loosen up. 

This has been a problem in every serious romantic relationship I've ever had (I've had five serious relationships total). I hear things like: ""Do you not like me? Are you embarrassed to be seen with me?"" 

To make up for it, I have to be very conscious of touch, which is also awkward. I can't just naturally hold a girl's hand. I feel like my body language is saying in a robotic way: ""I am going to hold your hand now."" Same with putting my arm around my sweetie or whatever. 

Here's the thing: I like to touch, and I like being touched! In my brain I have no qualms with it at all and love physical contact. You know how some people hate it? Not me! Love it. But my body and brain do not agree on this, somehow.

I'm in the very early stages of a new relationship and I don't want this to be a problem. I don't want her to think I'm a weirdo because I'm bad at hand holding in public. I want to get over this somehow... ehhhh help?
","I'm super awkward when it comes to touching/being touched, even though mentally I don't have any hangups with it."
4924,"Dog overcoming her fears, one self aware human at a time.
Our Penny has always hated the car since the day we adopted her.  She was a 2 year old rescue, and had almost no exposure to the car before we got her.  We felt bad every time we drove around with her, and she was miserable, stressed, and often vomited.  We thought she got motion sick.

What we realized is that she didn't know how to handle the movements of a car, so she flopped around and fell constantly, and was generally very unstable.  So the only time we ever did drive her somewhere was to the vet.

Recently I've been taking her to doggy daycare during the day, and she absolutely loves it there.  Combine that with the fact that I've been driving like a total grandma taking curves, turns, and stops as gently as I can.  To the point where I feel bad for the people who drive behind me.  Since then Penny has been perfectly cool in the car and has even started to lay down and taken naps while I drive!

I'm quite happy that she's learning to hate the car less, and that I'm learning how to make it a better experience for her.  And I wanted to share.
",Dog hated car because her humans were unaware jerks who drove like assholes and she didn't feel stable or safe.  We are learning how to be better humans for our dog.
