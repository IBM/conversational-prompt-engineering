text,summary"My fellow redditors! Within reason.. turn your ridiculous ideas into porn!
Soo there isn't a question in the headline.. How about.. Reddit, what kind of porn would you make if you could?

Be respectful. I may be a whore, but I'm a human being above all else!

I am in the process of developing a website for my alter ego porn star. 

I've decided that aside from all the normal boring porn stuff that I want really memorable pornos. Full length movies or short clips.

So far we are having a scenario where I am dared to suck off a corpse in a morgue.

I'm also going to fuck every super hero to which a costume is available and I am particularly excited about that!

Giant mud pit. Need I say more?

Sadly, unicorn porn was already made...

So, in this vast pool of insane and colorful minds that is reddit.. I ask you to share with me elaborate or not so elaborate ideas for porn. They don't all have to be silly, some things you legitimately might want to see and never do or never see enough of it.

In all seriousness your idea could get turned into the real thing and if it does I will send you a free copy of the production so you can show your friends!

Ok so I am almost 27 F,  in a serious long term relationship with my boyfriend of 7 years who is also almost 27. We have lived together since almost the beginning of our relationship and our connection was very strong from the start. For a little while now, especially lately I have been feeling less and less passion towards him. I don't really like to have sex anymore or even kiss him. There have been some broken trust issues (no cheating, but some lying and covering up on his end that always get revealed). He feels me kind of pulling away, which I assume causes him to feel less of a draw or connection towards me as well...at least that is how he has been acting and speaking lately.

I guess what I am asking is: is it normal for the passion to fizzle out, as the way I described? Or could this be me actually falling out of love with him, and maybe I should end it...I am scared to break up with him because I am not feeling passionate, only to find 7 years later with a new person the same lack of feelings. I don't want to be chasing around lust for my entire life...I want a life partner. So if anyone out there could offer some advice I would really appreciate it. I have heard that the 7th year is always the worst for some reason, so part of me is hoping that is what we are going through.

My boyfriend and I have been best friends for so long, I can't imagine my life without him, and I'm not that scared of not being able to find someone else, just that I wont have him in my life anymore.
",Is it normal for passion to fade and not have any sex drive at all (not even kissing) after 7 years?"26/F (ME!) greatly struggling to get over ex (25/M) even after lots of time and a new relationship
I am not sure if I am looking for advice or just some reassurance here, but here goes. Two years ago, I was in a relationship that I was very happy with--it did have its issues, as all relationships do, don't get me wrong--and saw lasting pretty much forever. Marriage, children, the whole shebang. It was a long distance relationship and on one fateful Tuesday night, completely out of the blue, he broke up with me via Facebook (we rarely ever communicated that way) and then literally never spoke to me again until just recently, again via a Facebook message. I had come to accept that I would likely never hear from him again after many unanswered attempts to contact him, and was proud of myself for responding with just a short ""thank you and hope you are well"" message rather than delving in to all of the emotions I felt upon receiving it.

I have been patient with myself because I know that the circumstances warranted a longer ""recovery"" period before being ready to move on, but there is still rarely a day that goes by that I don't think of him or his family. Sometimes I feel truly overwhelmed with sadness and/or anxiety when I think of him, especially if it crosses my mind that he may be getting married or having children with someone else. It is all I can do to not look him up on Facebook--the only way I'd know now to contact him--and send him some pathetic message about still being in love with him.

I am an independent person, I have started a career, traveled, dated other people, and still I feel this way. Is there anyone else out there who understands this or has suggestions about how to cope? I feel so alone in it.
",My life is continuing after a breakup two years ago but I still often feel overwhelmed with sadness and anxiety. Looking for support."My [22m] girlfriend [20f] of 7 months is having anxiety about us
So here's the deal. Girlfriend and I got together tonight to talk and hang out like normal (we both just got back from thanksgiving break and wanted to have some time together - we are both in college at the moment). We are having a great conversation and having fun. Then all of a sudden she sort of dropped a bomb on me. She told me she's been having anxiety about our future together. She said that she didn't want to break up, I make her extremely happy, it has absolutely nothing to do with me, but she's told me that something just isn't sitting right. I was sort of confused and frankly a little blindsided, but I asked her what she meant. She tried to explain as best she could, and said that for the last couple weeks she's just been really unsure about our relationship and just wondering if it is right/best for the both of us. Again emphasizing that it didn't have anything to do with me and she was just not feeling right about something. I pressed in a little and tried to see what the root was but honestly I don't even think she knows. 

Reddit, this is tearing me up. I hate to see her like this. I absolutely love this girl and would do anything in the world for her. I just don't know what to do or say or anything. I want to make it all better but can't. I feel like crap and wish I had a magic phrase I could say to make her feel better about us. But I can't. I'm not sure where to go from here and any honest advice is greatly appreciated.
","girlfriend is anxious and worried about us but she's not sure why. Says it has nothing to do with me or anything I've done. Want to reassure her and make her feel better, no clue how.""Me [29M] with my GF [29F] of 1 year: Having second thoughts with her in light of recent discoveries.
We've been dating about a year and a half. She talks about wanting to get married and have kids, but honestly based on recent discoveries about her, I'm not sure it's a great idea, and I'm thinking of breaking up with her because I don't think I want to have kids with her.

She got a message from a strange number on her phone, asking her for a payment. I thought it was weird, and asked her about it. She told me it was her cousin, who had loaned her money during college.

Later, during another conversation, she said something about it that rung untrue (contradictory). I pressed, and found that it wasn't her cousin, but her ex. She owed him $1800. Further pressing, I discovered she owed another ex roughly $1800 as well.

This really made me angry, as she was spending money like she didn't have two ex's she was beholden to. Also, she would randomly ask me for money, saying she needed it to buy groceries or somesuch (She's unemployed, looking for a job. May have one starting the fifth)

Next, we were watching Netflix on Chromecast yesterday using her phone. I grabbed it to switch shows and saw a message from her brother telling her to come home to get her mail, as she has an arrest warrant now for unpaid parking tickets. I gawked, but didn't say anything to her, because I expect she should share that information with me sooner rather than later. Right?

She's entitled to her privacy, but I think if she wants to enter into a relationship involving marriage/children she needs to be more up front than this. I'm not sure if her brother is joking with her or what. She hadn't responded to it, so I'm not sure. I can easily see her doing something like this. Is the arrest warrant a big deal? Is my house going to get searched or property siezed? (She stays here often). I'm not sure what to do.

Thanks in advance for the advice/comments.
","Found out she has debt to two ex's, and now may have a warrant out for her arrest based on unpaid traffic tickets."
