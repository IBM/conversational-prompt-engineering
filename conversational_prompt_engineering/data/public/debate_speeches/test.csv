"We should introduce compulsory voting.
So just quickly we're gonna lay out a model we think that it would be somewhat simple.
There would be a fine for individuals who don't vote, and obviously you have a tracking of people's birth records, their social security numbers so he would be automatically enrolled to vote and if they didn't show up at the polls, then they would be fined.
And that obviously if someone to write in a vote for literally a nonsense candidate or for a vote of no confidence, we would allow that to happen.
The whole point though is that people make it to the voting booth and express their preference, even if their preferences is for none of the above.
Alright, so three main arguments.
The first is about state legitimacy.
So in order for the state to be legitimate, it needs to have consent from the people and because there's no existing social contract, there's no literal way in which people can consent, we think that the most appropriate proxy for consent is that individuals vote.
But the problem in the status quo is that a large amount of people simply do not go out to vote, they do not have any sort of say in the government's decisions, in their decision making mechanisms, and we think that a system in which you have compulsory voting is more likely to ensure that the government aligns with the preferences of the people, and we think that this has a particular impact on a couple groups of people.
Firstly on younger individuals, and secondly on people that are in lower economic classes because these are the two groups in the status quo that have the lower the lowest percentage of voter turnout per registered voters and per populace, so we think that in having a system of compulsory voting is much more likely to drive these people to the polls which means the government becomes more representative of their views.
And there's reasons in the status quo for why these people can't vote aside from the fact that they simply don't want to, whether it's the fact that young people may not be physically close to their voting location, it's very difficult to vote absentee in certain places, or because people don't understand how absentee voting works and they're lazy or if you're a poorer individual, you may have to work multiple jobs including on the day of an election which can mean that your employer literally will not let you go to work or or in a less extreme case you simply don't have the time to go to work, so we think that part of this would be allowing these individuals to go and vote.
We think it could be a voting holiday that goes along with having compulsory voting, which means that these people would have the time and have the ability to go to vote.
Also, if you create a compulsory voting system, you have to also create the infrastructure that makes it capable for people to go to vote so that voting booths and that voting locations are not incredibly far apart from people and that you have more of these voting locations.
We think all these things make it much more likely that the government is actually representative of the people, which means that it is intrinsically more legitimate than the government that exists in the status quo.
The second thing that we think is a benefit of compulsory voting is that we think you get a more informed populace.
In the status quo because individuals know that they don't have to vote, many of them choose not to be informed about political matters.
But we think that by forcing them to vote and by saying that you must have a say, people are much more likely to just simply tune in to find out things about candidates and it's not difficult in this day and age to google candidates and find things out about their platform and to make decisions about local elections even things that things that are very niche to an area.
We think that having compulsory voting works at all levels of government, makes all levels of government far more legitimate, and makes it more likely that you'll have informed, civic engagement which we think is the sign of a healthy state.
For all these reasons we should introduce compulsory voting."
"We should subsidize student loans.
We mean by this is that we would prefer the government to allocate a certain amount of money within their budget to pay partially for the loans that students who go to higher education accrue.
We would be fine with incorporating this as part of the like a subsidization rate based on income or something similarly.
Three main areas of clash, first on why it is why it is good to encourage people to go to the to go to college.
I think recognize first and foremost that although we live in a world that has made grand steps into making college a more accessible activity through the use of things like of merit-based and financial need based aid we are still far away from achieving a world in which every student who prefers to is able to go to college.
Not just fiscaly.
Recognize that oftentimes financial based aid doesn't account for a fairly large fraction of students who are to have too much money to be to qualify for financial aid based on their income but don't have quite enough in order to cover college comfortably.
What this means is that these are often students who take out large amounts of loans but don't actually have anything to help them offset that cost but more than that there are also students who are simply scared away from going to college at all by the concept of having to take out loans or by the concept of exploring how expensive it is and we think that this is a combined optic and actually real harm in terms of how people feel going to college would would affect them fiscally.
We think that encouraging people to go to college is generally a good thing for a couple of reasons.
First recognize that we are vastly moving towards a world in which a college education is a prerequisite to any kind of job that will you pay will pay you more than above more than the minimum wage or enough to be actually livable.
And even jobs that don't technically require the skills that you acquire for college will still prioritize college graduates above someone who did not have a college degree.
But more than this, recognize that generally the boost in income that college will provide you even if it's the case that you would be able to find a job without a college degree, is usually significant enough that it would change the standard of living quite a bit for someone so we think that's also a good thing.
But finally we think that even if in the end of the day you're going to choose the same job that you would have received without a college degree the idea of having more options in a world where the job market tends to be unstable is always preferable to a world where it is not.
But second area of clash which is more related to this is why it is good for the economy.
Because recognize first that when you have more people attending college because they see the barrier to college as lower than that is good because these are people who will make more money when they when they have a job more money that they put back into the economy things like that but second and and this also interacts with the unemployment rate so we think that people who go to college and find jobs as opposed to individuals who don't go to college have a much larger employment rate that is definitely good for the economy but more than this recognize that once you are out of college if you have a large amount of loans there's a trade off between the amount of money that you have for non necessary goods compared to how much you have to spend on those loans.
We think it is always better for the economy if individuals spend their money on tradable goods or on other such like stimulative things that stimulate the economy instead of having to pay that money off in loans.
We also think that this generally makes people grow up a lot faster so we think that what happens on their side of the house a lot is that students who just graduated tend to move back in with their parents and take a little bit longer to become economically independent and we think that it is always better for the economy if individuals are fiscally independent.
But finally and third area of clash, recognize that college has become vastly a necessity and we think that in a world in which it has governments need to adjust to that and provide avenues for citizens to achieve a livable goal, not just bceause it is economically good but because it is fundamental to individuals.
Proud to propose."
"We should ban fast food.
What we're talking about specifically in this debate is we're gonna focus primarily on fast food chain restaurants, things like mcdonalds, subway burger king, anything that's a chain restaurant that primarily deals in giving food either through delivery, take away or through very quickly giving food, these types of restaurants.
We're going to talk about banning those fast food restaurants and why we think those are negative to the overall health of society.
So, we wanna start by just pointing out the obvious.
That fast food chains are in general, terribly unhealthy.
Even the healthy options in restaurants like mcdonald's, burger king and subway, so as their salads that come with high amounts of sugar, really terrible dressings for you, fried chicken, and other types of things that overall, don't make the healthy options on these menus any less detrimental to your health than getting a burger, or a bacon cheeseburger, anything awful that you could get at one of these restaurants.
These things are high in fats, sugars, cholesterol, calories, and are largely consumed by children and families, which we think, only makes the impacts, the negative health impacts of these things all the worse when they're being consumed by people that are most vulnerable and are in most need of a healthy and balanced nutritional diet.
So why do we think that we should ban fast foods?
We think that people in the status quo, because of fast food, choose to opt for the quicker option rather than the time it takes to prepare food.
On average the time it is taken to prepare food in the american household has gone down dramatically over the past two or three decades, and we think that the best way to combat that is to take away this option and to force people to try and make healthier decisions.
People argue that banning fast food leads to harm such as people having to pay overall more money for food, but recognize that, healthy alternatives and healthy options and supermarkets exist and that, these options, the ability to buy a loaf of bread, the ability to buy a bag of apples, things like this, are not dramatically more expensive than going to a fast food restaurant where you already need to pay taxes, and you're already being forced to spend upwards of five or ten dollars.
We think with comparable cost you can still be able to feed yourself when you're going to these restaurants uhh when you go to a supermarket, and when people compare speed we think that most meals are not necessarily needed to be eaten in five minutes, that they don't need to be at this speed, but if they do, you can again prepare these things yourself in a healthier manner.
The comparison is you can make a sandwich in five minutes in your house, or you can go to mcdonald's and buy a cheeseburger.
We think that the sandwich you make at your health, your house, is probably going to be on balance the same cost and the same amount of time it's going to take you, but it's going to have way fewer health hazards to you in the long run.
We think that this forces people to get healthier both we both, at their homes but also away from their homes.
So if people still choose to go out to eat when you remove fast food as an option, we think you go to restaurants in which the food is better handled, the nutritional standards are higher, and you're more likely to get a more balanced meal or even if not a more balanced meal, a meal in which the storage preparation in handling the food is of a higher quality to ensure that things like illnesses and disease aren't transferred by the foods that the masses are eating.
We think that this is crucial given the obesity epidemic that exists in our world today.
Childhood obesity rates are the highest they've ever been and are only going up, same with adult obesity rates.
We think that fast food and the culture surrounding fast food, is a major reason for this issue, and we think that when you eliminate fast food as an option, it forces these trend lines to change.
It forces people to make better and healthier decisions, not just because they, not because they want to, because as we see in the past and as we've seen through these rising trend lines, people don't want to make this change,.
We think it's up to the government and it's necessary for the government in consideration with its people's health and its people's needs to change what they're able to eat, to make this change on what people are able to serve and to better educate people along with making a change that doesn't allow them to get the least healthy options available.
Given that fast food restaurants present no healthy options and no way for people to make reasonable choices about their body, represent a hugely difficult trade off when you compare price cost in time in an ever quickening world, you need to force people to make this change themselves, and that's why we would ban fast food."
"We should increase racial profiling in the united states at airports.
So in this debate what we're arguing is that whereas right now the TSA, the security group at airports, often denies that they use racial profiling, or is forced to search people they don't want to search to avoid the appearance of racial profiling.
We should allow them instead to just openly racially profile people.
A few reasons why we think this is the case.
First of all safety.
Recognize that the reason why we have groups like the TSA in the first place is to promote airport security and to prevent another nine eleven attack from happening.
At the point where we know that the people most likely to carry out massive terrorist attacks are people from groups like al-qaeda, and at the point where those groups recruit primarily among certain populations of a given race, we think that since we're going after al-qaeda we should target the people most likely to be al-qaeda members.
Now some people might say that this is contrary to the principle that you can't discriminate against people based on their race, but we think that ultimately the trade off in terms of safety outweighs the harms to some people's individual freedom which is relatively modest.
We're not talking about like strip searching people and having cavity searches and things like that.
We're just talking about enhanced security for some individuals.
Our second argument is about fairness.
Now some people might say that it's unfair to profile one particular group.
But we think that what is being done right now is actually worse.
Because recognize that this profiling still goes on in the status quo to a great extent.
What happens in order to disguise it is that the TSA will stop one young apparently arab man at the airport and that in order to avoid charges of discrimination stop three old white women at the same airport.
We think that it's unfair to externalize these costs on to people who are very unlikely to be members of these terrorist groups and who have done nothing wrong in order to cover up this practice.
In either world racial profiling is going on.
The only question is: is it fair to punish other people in order to disguise this racial profiling?
We think that it would obviously be more fair to discriminate against fewer people, to make fewer people go through these procedures, and that therefore we should just allow explicit racial profiling at american airports.
Our third and final argument is that public will is in support of racial profiling.
Why is this important?
The united states derives its legitimacy is a government because it rests on the will of the people.
The american government is not a group of technocrats who decide what is best for the country, it is a group of representatives who are supposed to represent the interests of their constituents.
At the point where the united states is something like sixty five percent caucasian and overwhelmingly christian, probably over eighty percent, we think it's almost certain that a large majority of the country supports racial profiling against people of middle eastern background.
We think that at that point the united states must follow the will of the people, even if it has ends that are morally intolerable to some individuals.
Recognize that in the past the US has carried out lots of unpopular policies that were technically legal because of public support.
We think that we need to continue to do so now.
And if these policies are actually country to the constitution, then we should have supreme court rulings in place that prevent it from happening again.
In the meantime though, it's not up to the executive branch or individual legislators to decide what is in the best interest of the american people when they've made their own wishes fairly clear.
We think that in order for the american government to maintain its legitimacy in the eyes of its citizens it needs to implement popular, well-liked policies such as racial profiling at airports.
So ultimately, because racial profiling is going to go on either way, we think that it would be more fair to use it explicitly, and we think that the american government's legitimacy relies on public support and so therefore the policy should be implemented.
Thank you."
"We should ban fast-food.
So, by ban we mean that we think government should close down fast-food restaurants and prevent them from opening, and by fast-food we mean restaurants that offer food that's prepared very very quickly, usually this might be a place like mcdonald's or burger king and we think that these restaurants become very popular around the world in the last fifty, sixty years, although they're history goes back further.
So with that in mind we have two arguments for why we should ban fast-food: the first is about why government needs to intervene.
We have three reasons: firstly, we think that there is an information asymmetry between consumers of fast-food and sellers of fast-food.
Companies like mcdonald's know full well that their food is extremely harmful for the people that eat it.
They know that there are enough calories for an entire day in a single hamburger, or that a milk shake has enough sugar for one person for several days for instance, but they keep selling it anyway.
Now it's true that government can compel these restaurants to provide more information but we think that government will always be reactive and fall behind on the harms posed by this food and that people therefore won't have access to good true information about what they're actually consuming.
Aside from that, we think that many of the people who consume a lot of fast-food are low income and lack access to the type of education to allow them to make good decisions about their own nutrition in the form of this fast-food, when they're being presented with something that seems so good but it's actually so bad.
So we think that government should intervene because there is such a large gap here, that companies are able to take advantage of people because they have access to such better information.
Nextly under this, we think that there are harms to third parties from people's consumption of fast-food.
Parents often take their children to eat fast-food for instance, which can set them up for a lifetime of obesity, if they eat this food too often, or even serious illnesses like diabetes if they end up drinking too much soda and otherwise eating too many sugary foods which we think is much more likely when people eat fast-food and other types of food.
Because when you think about the type of food being served it's often very fatty and very sugary because that's the cheapest way to provide flavorful food.
We think that government clearly can intervene in instances when there are harms to third parties, especially children, and that this is why governments can do things like ban smoking in public buildings or ban parents from smoking in the car with their children.
Lastly under this we think that there is a state interest in healthcare costs.
People who eat lots of fast-food are more likely to get diabetes, more likely to be overweight, and we think therefore that in the long term it will be very expensive to provide them with health care.
So in countries like canada and britain where healthcare is publicly funded obviously this will drive up costs, and in countries like the US it'll drive up costs for medicare and medicaid.
So the state has a financial interest in keeping these costs lower and they can do that by shutting down fast-food restaurants that directly harm people's health.
The last thing that we want to talk about, as a second point, is why we think the alternative world books much better.
We think that if you ban fast-food you're more likely to have local restaurants open up.
Compared to fast-food restaurants many more local restaurants are locally ur other restaurants are locally owned.
So we think that this will actually help local businesses and bring money into communities rather than funnel it to headquarters in another country or another city.
We think that it'll lead to better access to healthy food because it creates an economic incentive to provide this type of food.
Food deserts, for instance, are places where there is no access to healthy fresh food.
This might be poor neighborhoods in large cities for instance, that don't have a supermarket but do have mcdonalds and burger king and everyone has to spend their money there to get food.
But if those places went away then suddenly there would be a great demand for food that the market wasn't meeting.
So we think that companies would come in to fill that demand by selling them the types of food that they could prepare at home or by opening better healthier restaurants and that that would necessarily solve a lot of the health problems in these communities by giving them access to better food.
So we think that you would help a lot of people who are in a really difficult situation and on top of that increase health in general.
So clearly it's a better alternative world.
For these reasons we should ban fast-food.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should legalize sex selection.
What we mean by this is that we would allow parents to use techniques such as microsorting and genetic testing to predetermine whether the fetuses that they're going to be implanting, either into the body or raising from a test tube, are going to be of a specific gender, and then based on those results, we would allow parents to throw away or not or choose not to use a fetus that is of a specific, to them personally, undesirable gender.
For the purpose of this debate, we're going to be talking about men versus women given that it is very difficult to distinguish at the beginning of a baby's birth whether or not they're going to end up being non-binary or trans or anything like that.
Two main areas of clash, first on the rights of parents.
We think that generally people have a right to choose the characteristics of the child that they're going to raise.
They're going to give up so much of their life, money, energy and time, like bringing this child into the world and making sure that they are growing up in a healthy like hopefully happy, hopefully well up provided for home, and as such, we think you you should probably be able to select what where that money and energy and time is going to go.
We think that forms of this are already allowed in the status quo.
We can choose all of our child's influences: what they watch, what they're going to wear, who they're friends with who their teachers oftentimes like where they live, all of these things, and we're just unclear on why there's a specific higher standing for changing your child's genetics with respect to gender.
We actually think it's the burden on opp in this round to show to us why gender and genetics are so much more important than things like where you go to school and like what the main influences in your life are going to be.
In fact, we think that there's actually no difference at all, given that there have been confirmed links between genetic data and the kind of environment that we grow up in, ie, the environment that we have might stimulate our DNA to methylate or phosphorylate, which then change the expression of certain genes.
So, at the point that we literally already allow parents to essentially change and direct their children's genes, we don't know why this is so much more different, and we think that it's naturally stemming from the rest of their rights.
We also think that a child is very much a personal investment on the part of the parents.
Any investment that someone makes is one that you hope to be profitable and one that you need to include your preference, right?
Like, I'm not going to invest my money in a bank or a corporation that I do not believe in or that I think is going to fail.
And so we think that children are very similar in that you don't want to invest all of that energy and all of that time and all of that pain in a child that like maybe you didn't necessarily want or a has certain characteristics that are going to keep it from being able to rise higher in the world.
Like maybe you just really think that women are going to do better than men or vice versa.
Our second area of clash is about mitigating negative outcomes.
Recognize that anyone who cares so passionately about the gender of their child in a world where sex selection is illegal is likely to attempt an abortion either way, right?
Like at the point that they're willing to threaten to do this, to look for means to do this, if they were going to do it on our side of the house, they're likely to still find a way to do so on the opposition side of the house, and we think that this oftentimes takes much more pernicious ways.
Like, recognize that when china instituted the one-child policy, you had a lot of female babies just getting left in the woods after they were born because their parents didn't want them, and they wanted to be able to have another child afterwards.
But, like, recognize that even if we managed to force people to keep these children, it is very likely that they're going to mistreat the child.
Given that they didn't want it in the first place, they don't feel an obligation to take care of it.
We think that you're actually doing a favor to any child who's coming out of these circumstances by making sure that these people are not the ones who are going to be raising it in the long term.
We also think that in more moderate situations, there isn't incentive to misuse it because there's less of a conception that one gender is preferable to the other.
Like, recognize that there are perfectly good reasons that maybe you don't want to have a child of a certain gender.
Some diseases that are really specific to men or women can be cut out almost entirely in this way, and parents who are carriers don't have to worry if they're able to sex select.
And maybe you want another kid but you already have multiple boys or multiple girls.
We think it's fair for you to then say, "" I'm done with this group.
I want a different kind. ""
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should subsidize student loans.
Student loans are a necessary evil.
Even though the object itself is one of incredible disdain, if it didn't exist individuals in poverty could not access college.
However, the average amount that someone pays for a loan is largely not representative of that loan's effect on society.
That is to say, whenever someone takes out a loan and cannot pay it, they aren't getting much benefit from it and the corporation isn't getting any more benefit than they would from a loan that is paid back.
To this end we would propose and support the following model: that governments should use incredible amounts of money to subsidize loans to the tune of say sixty to eighty percent.
They could further use that that money to transfer all loans to subsidize loans that is to say loans that you only need to pay after you graduate college.
It will be sort of a pay it forward program where all the loans that someone pays off will then be used to help subsidize other people's loans.
Three arguments for why this is a good idea, first on when we subsidize.
We think that we subsidize if the price doesn't match the societal good.
We think when someone buys an ice cream cone, the person who sells it loses the benefits of that ice cream cone but gaining the money.
The person who buys the ice cream cone gains the benefit of the ice cream but lose their money.
This is as such essentially an equal trade between the two parties.
However if I consume fossil fuels, I pay for the fossil fuel, the company loses the fossil fuel but then the whole of society is hurt by the burned energy by the release of greenhouse gases and the general degradation of our environment.
We think that's student loans are a good, that's to say that we should subsidize them to increase the total amount of consumption beyond what individuals get for individual benefit.
Why is this the case?
First, we think that people can't think in terms of the long term.
As such they are unlikely to understand the overall benefits of an education and student loans and are less likely to consume as a result.
Second, because individuals simply have no concrete value that they can put upon education, people are bad at thinking in the abstract and as such they are unlikely to understand the total ramifications of their education.
Why is this so important?
We think that we will prove that education is a general good later and should be subsidized on that alone but it is inherently undervalued because of these other things.
Furthermore we think that corporations are happiest when student loans are paid off as fast as possible.
Why is this the case?
If I have to pay five percent interest on my loan every single year the company makes the same amount of money if I pay it off in two years and then they can loan that out to someone else who continues paying five percent per year as they would if I just paid the five percent every single year.
As such we think the older a loan is the less profitable it is to the individual but it gets no more additional profit for the corporation and as such they should be paid off as soon as possible.
My second argument is about the societal good.
We think that education is a societal good.
It allows people to challenge entrenched pedagogy and orthodoxy which allows for the creation of new ideas, new spaces, and new innovation.
Furthermore we think that more education means higher levels of skilled work, more efficient work, and generally just a happy populace in general.
Third and finally we think this will empower the poor.
We think that the poor are generally barred from an effective education in the status quo.
They cannot access it as it is simply too expensive expensive.
If we massively subsidized student loans, we are far more likely to see an increase in the total amount of people in poverty going to college.
This is incredibly important for a few reasons.
First off these people are largely not to blame for their own poverty.
If someone is taking the effort to go to college and still use a decent sum a sum of their money to get an education, they are likely not the cause of their own poverty and as such we should reward them for working harder and reducing their total suffering.
Additionally we think that we'll just generally get higher skilled workers which improves our total economy.
For this reason, we should subsidize student loans."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should introduce compulsory voting.
First a little bit of modeling.
We think that this would basically consist of automatic voter registration.
Either we're going to have online ballots, or in the very least voting days going to be moved to a weekend.
Like we think that if we're introducing something compulsory were also going to make it as easy for people to access it as possible, and it's also going to be a situation in which like clearly this is in the united states and yeah.
So two main areas of clash: first on the alternation of societal specific norms.
So first we think that currently there's a massive problem with individuals being uninformed and apathetic about their local governments, and about their widespread elections.
They feel like their votes don't matter and they feel like they don't know enough to vote in the first place.
And currently people are okay with being like that because they know that they're not gonna vote and they've already kind of fooled themselves into believing that it wouldn't matter even if they did.
But when you actually place a pressure on these individuals, and you say that: "" look, you like you're going to have to vote when it comes down to it. ""
And you force them to face the fact that their vote will matter, we think there's much more pressure to remain informed, because you feel like you're actually going to be letting yourself and others down if you don't.
And so we think that people are going to start treating it much more like a duty and they're also going to be more pressure to inform on the part of political parties in the media.
Because if you're going to make something compulsory, and there's going to be large swathes of people who are going out who previously had not been, you're also going to have much more catering on the part of political political parties to those who they never really had faced before.
We also think that what we do on our side of the house is make voting a normal expectation.
Currently, people see voting as like a pleasant right.
It's like an option that they don't necessarily have to take, especially since they don't have to tell their friends that they didn't have to take it.
So what we would prefer is a world in which we saw voting as a specific duty that we have to do.
If we change the culture, we change the people around it as well.
So we think that as soon as we can instill this norm you're going to have much more enthusiasm about voting, you're going to have much more research about the political candidates and all that good stuff.
We also think that creating compulsory voting is likely to decrease national divisiveness.
A divided nation occurs in part because a part of that nation feels unheard and others don't reach out or recognize that they feel unheard.
But the part of the reason that they aren't recognizes because they tend not to say very much about it.
And we think that voting replaces that speech.
It allows them to stay silent without staying silent completely, because you're still going to start a conversation about this like change in the proportion of votes.
So we think that you'd actually be able to catch something like the current donald trump phenomena much earlier, because you're actually going to see people being forced to vote early on and you're going to see their political leanings and you're going to be able to ask why are we suddenly seeing this like massive demographic that has never voted like has always voted democratic or like has always been a third party, start to vote for like more extremist characters.
Our second area of clash has to do with achieving the most representative government.
Because in the end of the united states is a democracy and it doesn't want to represent the people who live within it.
So we think first that compulsory voting forces politicians to advertise to those historically disadvantaged and non voting populations.
Because currently all they have to do is isolate those populations that are most likely to vote and cater to them.
These populations tend to be the rich and like the upper middle class.
But now there's this massive new voting block and it forces politicians to inform them about what's going on because they want to have their vote.
It forces them to pass policy that these people are going to agree with because they need to have their vote.
We also think it decreases the power of money in the political system.
Currently giving cash basically gets you whatever you want, but if you have to get elected first, we think that you actually divert the attention for money to solid votes instead.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"We should ban racial profiling for two reasons.
First because it's a violation of rights and second because it actually makes people less safe.
So first, why is racial profiling a violation of rights?
Let's start by looking at the fact that it is an inherent rights violation.
Why is this true?
Because the because by the lottery of birth, people don't really have any control over where they're born into.
That's not something that you actually choose, you don't choose the color of your skin.
Or the religion that you grow up with, it's probably picked out by your parents.
So why do we think that this is important?
Because when you are profiling somebody on the base of their race, especially assuming criminality or terrorist motives to the basis of their race, or to a heightened presumption that they might be a perpetrator of such an action, it assigns blame to a race where it presumes blame onto a predominant group of people rather than assigning blame to individual people.
This is an incredibly big problem.
Because what it essentially is is a form of discrimination, because it means that the reason why someone is committing a crime is because they're a criminal because they have bad morals but that doesn't have anything to do with the color of their skin or the way in which they grew up.
But this is additionally yeah besides this just being an inherent rights violation we also believe that this will likely be a rights violation in the way that it's applied.
Why?
Because oftentimes police are able to take advantage of the leniency of society when it comes to safety measures.
This is very true in america, obviously, where you see shootings of unarmed black men on a tragically regular basis.
And that oftentimes convictions rarely if if ever follow and penalties are hardly ever more than a slap on the wrist.
This is clearly evident of a culture in which these things are permissible but additionally society also just scares easily.
You hear about instances of street harassment and bullying, acts of hate crimes against people, acts of hate crimes against muslims and islamophobia as rampant and these things are oftentimes stroked by media fears and when you and when you allow the use of racial profiling it essentially legitimizes that race can be a characteristic that could lead you wanting to identify somebody as a terrorist in the media and things like that.
So then I also think makes is like quite a violation of their rights because this is simply undeserved on their part.
But the next thing that I want to talk about is that I actually think that this makes society less safe.
Why is this true?
So first because it creates a presumption of where the threat is coming from, or expectation of who is actually threatening you that is ultimately not all that helpful in actually fighting threats.
Why?
Because terrorists and criminals belong to people of all races and religions and that just because some more happen to be come from some groups of people other than other groups of people when there is racial profiling allowed it usually focuses on the most prevalent groups.
This often comes at the expense of us not considering the threats that can come from people whom we may not expect them to come from.
So this ultimately makes you less safe in a lot of ways too.
But this is finally going to make people less safe because of the way in which the targeted groups of racial profiling react to this.
So even if you can make arguments that this isn't actually a violation of rights, the reality is is that the people involved in this, the people being targeted by this, do believe it is a rights violation.
What does this mean?
It means that it's just another example of society condemning these people who are already oftentimes not treated very well in society at large so I think that if anything this is going to make it more likely that people are going to, on the margins, turn to extremism or terrorism or more radical sects altogether.
And this is because they're going to be seen as less accepted by mainstream society.
They're not going to ever feel like they're secure in their own identity.
This is an incredibly this is incredibly messed up thing and it ultimately only makes it our society less safe and less secure.
So for all of those reasons we should definitely ban racial profiling."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should legalize sex selection.
In terms of the model, we're not going to take a stance on sex selective abortion, specifically we're talking about, you know, technologies that allow a developing embryo to be you know one sex or the other based on the parent's decision.
And then of course like the physicians will go in and they will, you know, do the necessary technology things to make that happen.
Two independent points: the first being parental rights.
So we first want to establish what the basis for parental rights is.
And is really two fold: one is the rights of the parents themselves, to just you know have things that they like to happen, happen.
They, as individuals, have to you know go through a decent amount, like living with the kid, and that entitles them to a certain amount of latitude over you know what sort of experience they will have in raising that child.
But the second is the way in which the parents themselves are proxies for the child's best interest.
Especially at an embryonic stage, the kid isn't really capable of advocating for themselves.
And at that point then, the most meaningful proxy for the children's will, is the parents themselves.
You know in early childhood of course the parent is just the most familiar with the with the child and what the child's interests are, but even in embryonic stage the parent is still the best proxy because the parents understand best the environment in which the child's going to be raised.
So they have the best understanding of what this child will be like, based on what they're going to make that child into.
At that point then we think that sex is obviously something that has a significant impact on the outcomes a child has in life.
Discrimination against women is rampant, but there are also structural reasons, like an individual countries culture, that might signify whether it is better to be raised up a boy or a girl.
At that point then it seems eminently reasonable to allow this decision to be made by parents.
What sort of life is this child going to have, and is it going to be a positive one?
We think at that point then, if you know sex is a significant factor in the quality of the life, in the amount of discrimination or whatever the child might experience, it's it's reasonable for the parent to say: "" this will be a better life "".
Or if you personally I will just enjoy having this individual sex more.
If a child you know if a set of parents just really wants to raise a girl, that I think it's within their rights to allow them to do so, insofar as they probably have legitimate reasons for wanting that.
But the second thing I'd like to establish, my second independent point, is that the children themselves don't have intrinsic rights that can't be proxied by the parents.
I think this is true for two reasons: the first is that the kid just doesn't have, at this point, any rights at all really.
When you're talking about an embryo this almost certainly doesn't meet the standard for what constitutes a entity with rights.
If you go by pain and pleasure, you know whether or not they are capable of having specific desires and preferences, then it's almost certainly not true.
Obviously the science is still out on this, but it doesn't seem that embryos have much capacity to react to external stimuli, and at that point they probably don't have preferences.
If it's in terms of intelligence or some other standard like that then they even more certainly don't meet that standard.
They haven't developed even brains yet, so there really isn't a way by which you can apply that standard to them.
At that point then, if the entity doesn't have rights it doesn't make sense to prioritize their rights.
It makes much more sense to prioritize the will of the parents.
But let's assume that the embryo does have rights.
I don't think that they have a proactive right to the particular sex that was randomly assigned to them, you know, through, what will be assigned to them through development.
Rather, you know, since this was random chance in the first place anyway, it almost makes more sense to just proxy this off to the parents, insofar as the parents just structurally are more likely to choose something that will benefit the child than like a literal coin flip would.
Proud to propose."
