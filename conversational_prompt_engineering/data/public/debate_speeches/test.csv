"We should increase racial profiling in the united states at airports.
So in this debate what we're arguing is that whereas right now the TSA, the security group at airports, often denies that they use racial profiling, or is forced to search people they don't want to search to avoid the appearance of racial profiling.
We should allow them instead to just openly racially profile people.
A few reasons why we think this is the case.
First of all safety.
Recognize that the reason why we have groups like the TSA in the first place is to promote airport security and to prevent another nine eleven attack from happening.
At the point where we know that the people most likely to carry out massive terrorist attacks are people from groups like al-qaeda, and at the point where those groups recruit primarily among certain populations of a given race, we think that since we're going after al-qaeda we should target the people most likely to be al-qaeda members.
Now some people might say that this is contrary to the principle that you can't discriminate against people based on their race, but we think that ultimately the trade off in terms of safety outweighs the harms to some people's individual freedom which is relatively modest.
We're not talking about like strip searching people and having cavity searches and things like that.
We're just talking about enhanced security for some individuals.
Our second argument is about fairness.
Now some people might say that it's unfair to profile one particular group.
But we think that what is being done right now is actually worse.
Because recognize that this profiling still goes on in the status quo to a great extent.
What happens in order to disguise it is that the TSA will stop one young apparently arab man at the airport and that in order to avoid charges of discrimination stop three old white women at the same airport.
We think that it's unfair to externalize these costs on to people who are very unlikely to be members of these terrorist groups and who have done nothing wrong in order to cover up this practice.
In either world racial profiling is going on.
The only question is: is it fair to punish other people in order to disguise this racial profiling?
We think that it would obviously be more fair to discriminate against fewer people, to make fewer people go through these procedures, and that therefore we should just allow explicit racial profiling at american airports.
Our third and final argument is that public will is in support of racial profiling.
Why is this important?
The united states derives its legitimacy is a government because it rests on the will of the people.
The american government is not a group of technocrats who decide what is best for the country, it is a group of representatives who are supposed to represent the interests of their constituents.
At the point where the united states is something like sixty five percent caucasian and overwhelmingly christian, probably over eighty percent, we think it's almost certain that a large majority of the country supports racial profiling against people of middle eastern background.
We think that at that point the united states must follow the will of the people, even if it has ends that are morally intolerable to some individuals.
Recognize that in the past the US has carried out lots of unpopular policies that were technically legal because of public support.
We think that we need to continue to do so now.
And if these policies are actually country to the constitution, then we should have supreme court rulings in place that prevent it from happening again.
In the meantime though, it's not up to the executive branch or individual legislators to decide what is in the best interest of the american people when they've made their own wishes fairly clear.
We think that in order for the american government to maintain its legitimacy in the eyes of its citizens it needs to implement popular, well-liked policies such as racial profiling at airports.
So ultimately, because racial profiling is going to go on either way, we think that it would be more fair to use it explicitly, and we think that the american government's legitimacy relies on public support and so therefore the policy should be implemented.
Thank you."
"We should legalize sex selection.
Sex selection is a relatively innocuous process in which particular sperm and embryos are selected such that a child has a particular gender upon birth.
It allows parents to express gate greater control over their children's future and, as such, express greater control over their own future as well.
We think that individuals should have as much control as possible over their own future, and when we deny individuals this sort of autonomy and this sort of self-determination, we are being fundamentally oppressive.
To this end, we support the following model: that countries around the world allow sex selection.
They will allow in vitro fertilization which allows the sex to be selected or any other process that does not depend on terminating an incorrect pregnancy.
We're not going to defend sex sex-selective abortions here, but we think that nearly any other tool is fair game in this debate.
Three arguments for why this is a good idea: first, on the rights of parents.
We think that parents sacrifice a massive amount to have a child.
It's incredibly difficult to raise a child from infancy to adulthood, and it costs huge amounts of money.
For many individuals, they want to have a number of children of different genders.
The standard american household is a child of each gender raised to adulthood.
We think this is relatively fair.
For many parents, though, this simply is not an option.
They either have children of the same gender or they keep having children until they get that sort of diversification they want, but then have too many children.
Either way, parents are sacrificing part of their future simply because of this sort of random choice.
We think that parents deserve the ability to control their own future and we believe that the gender of their child, while having no meaningful effect on the child itself insofar is it is not unjust to be born one gender or another, can have a meaningful effect on the parents.
As such, parents should be given greater autonomy and be able to choose the sex of the child.
Secondly, though, let's talk about parental efficacy because we think when parents are more passionate about raising a child, when they want to have more diverse experiences, they're usually better parents.
If someone has raised only boys for awhile and is, frankly, tired of it, then having a girl might make them a better parent going into the future.
We think that this sort of diversification is incredibly good for both parent and child.
We would also say that children who have siblings of a different sex are probably more likely to be respectful.
They're more likely to empathize with these people and have resources going into the future.
Contact is valuable for learning about a number of individuals from different backgrounds and, in this case, different sexes.
My third argument is about how this encourages family planning.
We think that individuals do not plan regarding having their family enough.
When individuals get together and actually discuss what they want to do, when they discuss it with their partner and that becomes normalized, and when they discuss it with a professional, they're far more likely to have a happy future, have a healthy child and, ultimately, empower everyone involved in the raising of the child.
To this end, we should legalize sex selection."
"We should subsidize student loans.
So we think that this is mostly a principle debate but just to give a model out there, we think that we're willing to subsidize student loans to an incredible amount, both private and federal loans.
We're willing to subsidize those student loans up to and including one hundred percent of the loan based on how large the loan is.
We think that this debate really is about the principle though, so let's get into the principle.
First, we think that this dramatically increases access to education.
Let's face it, college today is incredibly expensive and not only is it incredibly expensive, but it's increasing in cost every single year going up by as much as one to two percent every year on costs that are already exceeding fifty, sixty thousand dollars.
There are more and more jobs additionally that require a college degree.
So if you want to access that part of the economic sector, the part that happens to be the one that allows you to have the highest quality of life, the highest potential earnings, the highest ability of freedom, and the best ability to set yourself up in a secure economic situation, you need to go to college.
Education is recognized as a right up to the age of eighteen in most countries.
We think it should extend beyond that especially because just like a GED has always been a necessary requirement to get a decent job, college is now becoming a necessary requirement to get a decent job.
You need it to thrive in society and given that this is the case, we think that the government should protect rights and protect individual's ability to do things that are necessary and required by the society they're living in.
We think that subsidizing student loans makes them obviously more affordable and it increases access for people of all economic levels to go to university.
It doesn't just help those that are the poorest, those that never would have taken out loans in the first place, but it helps those that also took out these loans and are now struggling in in their life post college.
That's what we're gonna talk about next.
We think it is simply immensely economically utile to subsidize student loans.
Student loans create crushing debt.
There is more student loan debt in america right now than there is debt for car ownership, for something that is again ubiquitous with our society.
We think think that, and this is statistically shown to be the case, that this student loan debt has led to a dramatic impact on the lives that people, young people are choosing to live today.
They're slower in starting families which is detrimental to building communities, which is detrimental for their ability to build livelihoods and it's because people that have student loan debt can't afford to feed a child.
They can't afford to take care of people outside of themselves.
They're also slower in buying homes which means that they're not getting this good economic investment that is homeownership and instead more and more money is being poured into the dead weight loss that is renting and again this is because you can't afford to make a thirty thousand dollar down payment on a house if you have to pay a thousand dollars every month out of your salary in order to pay back your student loans.
There's also less money for investment and for creating small businesses again, because that money is simply already dedicated to paying student loans.
We think burdening a whole generation with debt squanders that potential for growth economically and personably and personally and that that is a horrible idea that we need to care about the young generation that is now graduating into a world in which they have to deal with those loan payment because they wanted to get a good education, because they wanted to make a good life for themselves but now they can't even do that for ten twenty years outside of college because they're still paying off these loans.
We think a burden this burden is largely there because of economic conditions outside of that individual's control, outside of this generation's control and for these reasons, we should subsidize student loans."
"Airport racial profiling in the united states is justified.
So what we're talking about is that in the US, if you go to a major airport, the TSA, which is the big security agency, we'll look for people who they believe are of arab or perhaps persian heritage and attempt to search those people at a much greater rate and more thoroughly than they would search say white americans.
And we're arguing that this is something that the state should continue to do because it's just.
So, two main arguments.
The first is that we think that this racial profiling ultimately will stop acts of terror.
Recognize first of all, that there was relatively little racial profiling before the nine eleven attacks the nine eleven attacks happen.
Now there's a great deal of racial profiling but there hasn't been another major terror attack in the united states.
Conversely, rates of hijacking have continued to remain high in other parts of the world.
They've really only decreased here since nine eleven.
We think that greater security measures including profiling are the like the reason why.
It's true that it's difficult to separate the effectiveness of racial profiling from the effectiveness of greater airport security in general, but we think that clearly this tactic is working and since the purpose of airport security is to reduce hijacking and acts of terror, that we ought not change what we're doing.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
But on top of that, we think that it is ethically acceptable to profile given that it is effective.
We think that clearly if well, this airport profiling may be you know uncomfortable or frustrating to certain individuals, that the benefits to the general public of knowing that they can fly in safety are much greater.
On aggregate, the benefits of this policy to the majority of people are much greater than the harms to a small minority of people who suffer as a result of this policy.
We're perfectly fine with saying here that the ends justify the means.
If we get safer travel and if we do it by discomforting a small minority of people, then we're perfectly okay with risking that harm in order to achieve the greater end.
We think that what would be unjust would be to say that the right of a small minority of people not to be profiled is greater than the right of others to travel in relative safety.
One, because of the number of people affected and two, because we think that the potential harms of terror attacks grossly outweigh the harms of being felt up by a security official in an airport.
It's certainly unpleasant, but at the end of the day it's not the end of the world, where is for someone on the hijacked plane, that may well be the end of the world.
So with these arguments in mind, we think that it's clear that this is a just policy because it stops terrorists.
Our second argument is that this is a just policy because it is the public will.
We think that in order to be just, a liberal democracy like the united states must obey the public will and the american people clearly support profiling at airports.
They re-elected george bush, they were broadly supportive of the creation of the TSA, and if they resent the TSA now it's because they don't like having to take their laptop out at security, not that they're opposed to the agency in and of itself.
We think that the american government has an obligation to act as it's people would have it act.
The senators and congress people in the US are not trustees who act as the betters of the american people to make decisions for them.
They are representatives who reflect the will of the people.
At that point we think it would be very much unjust for them to ignore this.
We think that the policy is justified because it is supported by public opinion.
Now the other side is going to tell you that individual rights can't be subject to majority approval, but we tell you that the right being violated here, namely the right to travel in comfort at the airport, is of a fairly low level.
We're not talking about hurting people physically here.
So at the end of the day, we think that this is acceptable.
For these reasons, we think that airport racial profiling in the US is justified.
Thank you."
"We should introduce compulsory voting, because turnout is one of the absolute most important things in a democratic society, and, I think compulsory voting is going to increase turnout.
So, let's start by talking about the problem of turnout.
One of the biggest problems plaguing a lot of democratic societies is a lack of participation.
So, when you look at a place like the united states, you can only more or less expect like fifty to sixty percent of people participating, I believe, in most in a presidential election.
In mid term elections, or local elections, numbers are often even lower, and a whole lot of people aren't participating.
And additionally, in a lot of countries around the world , this is a similar problem, like I believe participation in the the UK prime minister election that took place a couple of days ago, I believe participation hovered in, like, somewhere in the sixties, and it historically high turnout.
So, the problem with this is, that when you have numbers like that, you're a democracy, but it seems like a huge portion, like millions of people, aren't participating in the process.
And, even if they're not participating in the process, in order for the state to be just, it still has to obey the will of the people, and it's therefore important to make sure that, it's as easy for people to participate as possible.
I think compulsory voting makes it more likely that people are going to participate, in two ways.
First and foremost, people don't want to get fined, people don't want to face the possibility of minor levels of punishment, and people just like don't want to deal with that.
So, people are probably going to vote to avoid that.
But moreover, when voting is seen as something that is, like, your civic duty, rather than something as that you're obligated to do, it gives people more latitude to suppress votes in some ways in line with political incentives.
So, when you look at places like america, it's easier to have your elections on a work day, where it's hard for some people to get off from work, and it could be more inaccessible, it's easier to make it more difficult for people to vote by mail or electronically, it's easier to make it so that people can't vote, by like exclusionary voter ID practices, it's easier to put elections all on different days, at different times, to make it harder for people to vote, but when you make voting compulsory, and people face the possibility of getting punished for not voting, I think that there's going to be a whole lot of pressure to make sure that, if people have to vote, then voting is much more accessible to people.
And, I think that that's absolutely great for political participation, and I think that the result of this is that more people are going to participate, and you're going to see spikes in turnout.
That's huge, because it means that the state is more representative.
Policy is going to be more representative to the politicians, politicians can act more powerfully and decisively, because they have a stronger mandate of the people, and there's not like this like possibility of like, well, half the people didn't participate, and a couple of thousand votes in one or two areas can swing the entire election.
You're gonna have much more of a possibility of, like, what the what people actually want.
So, for all those reasons, compulsory voting should be introduced."
"We should ban fast-food.
So, by ban we mean that we think government should close down fast-food restaurants and prevent them from opening, and by fast-food we mean restaurants that offer food that's prepared very very quickly, usually this might be a place like mcdonald's or burger king and we think that these restaurants become very popular around the world in the last fifty, sixty years, although they're history goes back further.
So with that in mind we have two arguments for why we should ban fast-food: the first is about why government needs to intervene.
We have three reasons: firstly, we think that there is an information asymmetry between consumers of fast-food and sellers of fast-food.
Companies like mcdonald's know full well that their food is extremely harmful for the people that eat it.
They know that there are enough calories for an entire day in a single hamburger, or that a milk shake has enough sugar for one person for several days for instance, but they keep selling it anyway.
Now it's true that government can compel these restaurants to provide more information but we think that government will always be reactive and fall behind on the harms posed by this food and that people therefore won't have access to good true information about what they're actually consuming.
Aside from that, we think that many of the people who consume a lot of fast-food are low income and lack access to the type of education to allow them to make good decisions about their own nutrition in the form of this fast-food, when they're being presented with something that seems so good but it's actually so bad.
So we think that government should intervene because there is such a large gap here, that companies are able to take advantage of people because they have access to such better information.
Nextly under this, we think that there are harms to third parties from people's consumption of fast-food.
Parents often take their children to eat fast-food for instance, which can set them up for a lifetime of obesity, if they eat this food too often, or even serious illnesses like diabetes if they end up drinking too much soda and otherwise eating too many sugary foods which we think is much more likely when people eat fast-food and other types of food.
Because when you think about the type of food being served it's often very fatty and very sugary because that's the cheapest way to provide flavorful food.
We think that government clearly can intervene in instances when there are harms to third parties, especially children, and that this is why governments can do things like ban smoking in public buildings or ban parents from smoking in the car with their children.
Lastly under this we think that there is a state interest in healthcare costs.
People who eat lots of fast-food are more likely to get diabetes, more likely to be overweight, and we think therefore that in the long term it will be very expensive to provide them with health care.
So in countries like canada and britain where healthcare is publicly funded obviously this will drive up costs, and in countries like the US it'll drive up costs for medicare and medicaid.
So the state has a financial interest in keeping these costs lower and they can do that by shutting down fast-food restaurants that directly harm people's health.
The last thing that we want to talk about, as a second point, is why we think the alternative world books much better.
We think that if you ban fast-food you're more likely to have local restaurants open up.
Compared to fast-food restaurants many more local restaurants are locally ur other restaurants are locally owned.
So we think that this will actually help local businesses and bring money into communities rather than funnel it to headquarters in another country or another city.
We think that it'll lead to better access to healthy food because it creates an economic incentive to provide this type of food.
Food deserts, for instance, are places where there is no access to healthy fresh food.
This might be poor neighborhoods in large cities for instance, that don't have a supermarket but do have mcdonalds and burger king and everyone has to spend their money there to get food.
But if those places went away then suddenly there would be a great demand for food that the market wasn't meeting.
So we think that companies would come in to fill that demand by selling them the types of food that they could prepare at home or by opening better healthier restaurants and that that would necessarily solve a lot of the health problems in these communities by giving them access to better food.
So we think that you would help a lot of people who are in a really difficult situation and on top of that increase health in general.
So clearly it's a better alternative world.
For these reasons we should ban fast-food.
Thank you."
"We should subsidize student loans.
We mean by this is that we would prefer the government to allocate a certain amount of money within their budget to pay partially for the loans that students who go to higher education accrue.
We would be fine with incorporating this as part of the like a subsidization rate based on income or something similarly.
Three main areas of clash, first on why it is why it is good to encourage people to go to the to go to college.
I think recognize first and foremost that although we live in a world that has made grand steps into making college a more accessible activity through the use of things like of merit-based and financial need based aid we are still far away from achieving a world in which every student who prefers to is able to go to college.
Not just fiscaly.
Recognize that oftentimes financial based aid doesn't account for a fairly large fraction of students who are to have too much money to be to qualify for financial aid based on their income but don't have quite enough in order to cover college comfortably.
What this means is that these are often students who take out large amounts of loans but don't actually have anything to help them offset that cost but more than that there are also students who are simply scared away from going to college at all by the concept of having to take out loans or by the concept of exploring how expensive it is and we think that this is a combined optic and actually real harm in terms of how people feel going to college would would affect them fiscally.
We think that encouraging people to go to college is generally a good thing for a couple of reasons.
First recognize that we are vastly moving towards a world in which a college education is a prerequisite to any kind of job that will you pay will pay you more than above more than the minimum wage or enough to be actually livable.
And even jobs that don't technically require the skills that you acquire for college will still prioritize college graduates above someone who did not have a college degree.
But more than this, recognize that generally the boost in income that college will provide you even if it's the case that you would be able to find a job without a college degree, is usually significant enough that it would change the standard of living quite a bit for someone so we think that's also a good thing.
But finally we think that even if in the end of the day you're going to choose the same job that you would have received without a college degree the idea of having more options in a world where the job market tends to be unstable is always preferable to a world where it is not.
But second area of clash which is more related to this is why it is good for the economy.
Because recognize first that when you have more people attending college because they see the barrier to college as lower than that is good because these are people who will make more money when they when they have a job more money that they put back into the economy things like that but second and and this also interacts with the unemployment rate so we think that people who go to college and find jobs as opposed to individuals who don't go to college have a much larger employment rate that is definitely good for the economy but more than this recognize that once you are out of college if you have a large amount of loans there's a trade off between the amount of money that you have for non necessary goods compared to how much you have to spend on those loans.
We think it is always better for the economy if individuals spend their money on tradable goods or on other such like stimulative things that stimulate the economy instead of having to pay that money off in loans.
We also think that this generally makes people grow up a lot faster so we think that what happens on their side of the house a lot is that students who just graduated tend to move back in with their parents and take a little bit longer to become economically independent and we think that it is always better for the economy if individuals are fiscally independent.
But finally and third area of clash, recognize that college has become vastly a necessity and we think that in a world in which it has governments need to adjust to that and provide avenues for citizens to achieve a livable goal, not just bceause it is economically good but because it is fundamental to individuals.
Proud to propose."
"We should legalize sex selection because first and foremost, it's something that already happens anyway so you might as well allow people to do it in a more technologically advanced and safer way and secondarily, because it's a matter of choice and it's a choice that people have the right to make.
So first let's talk let's start by talking about why the banning of sex selection is kind of unenforceable and it's unenforceable because you're able to usually determine the gender of a baby before the period where you can legally have an abortion ends.
So in a world in which all of the worst arguments on the other side are true, where people like don't want to have a baby of a particular sex for a malicious reason, maybe because they think that like women are inferior or because you live in a patriarchal society where only men can like own property or like do certain kinds of work or things like that.
Even if all those worst things are true it's already something that happens in the status quo and it's already something that people can do because in most places, in a lot of places at least, abortion is legal, abortion is effective, and it's successful.
So if people want to so people can just get an abortion.
So I think that using technology to essentially decide like what gender your baby would be essentially like manipulating like using like technological methods to manipulate like the like gender of like the embryo and things like that or things all those kinds of like technology are just like the next step in ways in which people can achieve like their choices in life, which I think is fine, because I think that we should give people the benefit of the doubt that by and large especially in places where there's more advanced technology is going to be available in a lot of western countries, I think that by and large we should give people the benefit of the doubt that people may just want to have a baby of a particular gender for a rather benign reason like maybe someone doesn't want to have three boys, maybe they want to have like one girl just to see what it's like.
Maybe someone has just grown up always wanting to have like a boy.
Maybe people have like a personal reasons to do to like have different kinds of genders of babies because that's what they want to do.
That's perfectly fine no matter what your reason is because the way in which like having a dependent, having a child, is like a rather important thing in your life and you should be able to have like control over how it happens because it is such a big and your life.
So for all of those reasons, we should legalize sex selection."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should introduce compulsory voting.
First a little bit of modeling.
We think that this would basically consist of automatic voter registration.
Either we're going to have online ballots, or in the very least voting days going to be moved to a weekend.
Like we think that if we're introducing something compulsory were also going to make it as easy for people to access it as possible, and it's also going to be a situation in which like clearly this is in the united states and yeah.
So two main areas of clash: first on the alternation of societal specific norms.
So first we think that currently there's a massive problem with individuals being uninformed and apathetic about their local governments, and about their widespread elections.
They feel like their votes don't matter and they feel like they don't know enough to vote in the first place.
And currently people are okay with being like that because they know that they're not gonna vote and they've already kind of fooled themselves into believing that it wouldn't matter even if they did.
But when you actually place a pressure on these individuals, and you say that: "" look, you like you're going to have to vote when it comes down to it. ""
And you force them to face the fact that their vote will matter, we think there's much more pressure to remain informed, because you feel like you're actually going to be letting yourself and others down if you don't.
And so we think that people are going to start treating it much more like a duty and they're also going to be more pressure to inform on the part of political parties in the media.
Because if you're going to make something compulsory, and there's going to be large swathes of people who are going out who previously had not been, you're also going to have much more catering on the part of political political parties to those who they never really had faced before.
We also think that what we do on our side of the house is make voting a normal expectation.
Currently, people see voting as like a pleasant right.
It's like an option that they don't necessarily have to take, especially since they don't have to tell their friends that they didn't have to take it.
So what we would prefer is a world in which we saw voting as a specific duty that we have to do.
If we change the culture, we change the people around it as well.
So we think that as soon as we can instill this norm you're going to have much more enthusiasm about voting, you're going to have much more research about the political candidates and all that good stuff.
We also think that creating compulsory voting is likely to decrease national divisiveness.
A divided nation occurs in part because a part of that nation feels unheard and others don't reach out or recognize that they feel unheard.
But the part of the reason that they aren't recognizes because they tend not to say very much about it.
And we think that voting replaces that speech.
It allows them to stay silent without staying silent completely, because you're still going to start a conversation about this like change in the proportion of votes.
So we think that you'd actually be able to catch something like the current donald trump phenomena much earlier, because you're actually going to see people being forced to vote early on and you're going to see their political leanings and you're going to be able to ask why are we suddenly seeing this like massive demographic that has never voted like has always voted democratic or like has always been a third party, start to vote for like more extremist characters.
Our second area of clash has to do with achieving the most representative government.
Because in the end of the united states is a democracy and it doesn't want to represent the people who live within it.
So we think first that compulsory voting forces politicians to advertise to those historically disadvantaged and non voting populations.
Because currently all they have to do is isolate those populations that are most likely to vote and cater to them.
These populations tend to be the rich and like the upper middle class.
But now there's this massive new voting block and it forces politicians to inform them about what's going on because they want to have their vote.
It forces them to pass policy that these people are going to agree with because they need to have their vote.
We also think it decreases the power of money in the political system.
Currently giving cash basically gets you whatever you want, but if you have to get elected first, we think that you actually divert the attention for money to solid votes instead.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should ban fast foods.
Three independent points.
First is that fast food is terribly unhealthy.
So I think this is fairly intuitive.
That we all understand why mcdonald's is bad.
These foods are generally rich in sodium, they have large amounts of trans fat, whatever the bad fat is, they're high in cholesterol, and they are low in nutrients.
They don't have much in the way of vitamins or other things that are actually healthy and important parts of a balanced diet.
So why then do we think that the government is justified in intervening in these problematic health decisions?
Two reasons.
First is that there's an information asymmetry intrinsic to these types of fast food.
That even if people understand to an extent that fast food is bad for you, they often do not understand how incredibly bad it is for you.
That a lot of people see it as like, oh well if I have like mcdonald's every night for dinner, that's like having like I don't know like red meat instead of white meat.
I think there are obviously lots of people, including like people like us who are disproportionately well educated, that really understand how bad this is for you, but I think generally speaking the people who consume it most are often the victims of ad campaigns that are designed to portray these types of food as equally healthy to things that are just mildly unhealthy.
But secondly, we think that there is going to be more access to healthy foods if you ban mcdonald's.
So a big part of the reason why poor families can't afford to eat healthy is because there is a premium on comparatively healthier foods.
That buying like raw fruits and vegetables and things like that is somewhat expensive by virtue of the fact that they're healthiness is a selling point.
But if you ban the comparatively unhealthy thing, that makes that a premium, then you decrease the market value of the healthy produce.
You bring down the price and you make it more affordable to families.
I think a good example of this is the fact that produce costs have gone up dramatically in the last few decades, mostly as a product of the widespread availability of cheap fast food.
If you get rid of the other force in the market that puts a premium on the healthy food, the prices go down and as a result become more affordable to poor individuals.
Our second independent point is the cultural harm that comes from fast food.
So we think that family meals where you sit down together and you spend time with your family are something that's really important.
That it strengthens the nuclear family structure when you are having this like daily interaction with your family members that forces that type of interaction and that type of structure.
And we think that the nuclear family is something that's very important, especially for children.
We think that it is something that provide structure to their lives and creates a stronger connection to individuals who have their best interests at mind.
And we think that generally speaking, it allows for support structures even for adults.
That's important to have that type of repetitive and reliable social interaction with people that you know are unconditionally attached to you.
We think that it is problematic then when that structure is weakened.
Our third independent point is wealth redistribution.
So franchises like fast food restaurants accumulate lots of money and then redirect that capital to people like say, ray kroc.
The comparative, small restaurants, generally accrue that capital to the middle class because those are the people that own these types of restaurants often.
So in this way, these small fast food joints drive inequity by funneling money from the lower classes and pushing it up to the uber rich.
Op is going to tell you that there's a trade-off here.
That the food will be pricier if it's smaller restaurants because of economies of scales and things like that.
I think we're comfortable though with that trade off insofar as we maintain capital in the lower classes, and stop the massive inequity that is being driven by institutions like the fast food industry.
Obviously this problem is bigger than the fast food industry, but we think this is still like a drop in the bucket that is moving in the right direction.
Proud to propose."
