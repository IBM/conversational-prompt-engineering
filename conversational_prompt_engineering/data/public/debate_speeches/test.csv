"We should subsidize student loans.
Student loans are a necessary evil.
Even though the object itself is one of incredible disdain, if it didn't exist individuals in poverty could not access college.
However, the average amount that someone pays for a loan is largely not representative of that loan's effect on society.
That is to say, whenever someone takes out a loan and cannot pay it, they aren't getting much benefit from it and the corporation isn't getting any more benefit than they would from a loan that is paid back.
To this end we would propose and support the following model: that governments should use incredible amounts of money to subsidize loans to the tune of say sixty to eighty percent.
They could further use that that money to transfer all loans to subsidize loans that is to say loans that you only need to pay after you graduate college.
It will be sort of a pay it forward program where all the loans that someone pays off will then be used to help subsidize other people's loans.
Three arguments for why this is a good idea, first on when we subsidize.
We think that we subsidize if the price doesn't match the societal good.
We think when someone buys an ice cream cone, the person who sells it loses the benefits of that ice cream cone but gaining the money.
The person who buys the ice cream cone gains the benefit of the ice cream but lose their money.
This is as such essentially an equal trade between the two parties.
However if I consume fossil fuels, I pay for the fossil fuel, the company loses the fossil fuel but then the whole of society is hurt by the burned energy by the release of greenhouse gases and the general degradation of our environment.
We think that's student loans are a good, that's to say that we should subsidize them to increase the total amount of consumption beyond what individuals get for individual benefit.
Why is this the case?
First, we think that people can't think in terms of the long term.
As such they are unlikely to understand the overall benefits of an education and student loans and are less likely to consume as a result.
Second, because individuals simply have no concrete value that they can put upon education, people are bad at thinking in the abstract and as such they are unlikely to understand the total ramifications of their education.
Why is this so important?
We think that we will prove that education is a general good later and should be subsidized on that alone but it is inherently undervalued because of these other things.
Furthermore we think that corporations are happiest when student loans are paid off as fast as possible.
Why is this the case?
If I have to pay five percent interest on my loan every single year the company makes the same amount of money if I pay it off in two years and then they can loan that out to someone else who continues paying five percent per year as they would if I just paid the five percent every single year.
As such we think the older a loan is the less profitable it is to the individual but it gets no more additional profit for the corporation and as such they should be paid off as soon as possible.
My second argument is about the societal good.
We think that education is a societal good.
It allows people to challenge entrenched pedagogy and orthodoxy which allows for the creation of new ideas, new spaces, and new innovation.
Furthermore we think that more education means higher levels of skilled work, more efficient work, and generally just a happy populace in general.
Third and finally we think this will empower the poor.
We think that the poor are generally barred from an effective education in the status quo.
They cannot access it as it is simply too expensive expensive.
If we massively subsidized student loans, we are far more likely to see an increase in the total amount of people in poverty going to college.
This is incredibly important for a few reasons.
First off these people are largely not to blame for their own poverty.
If someone is taking the effort to go to college and still use a decent sum a sum of their money to get an education, they are likely not the cause of their own poverty and as such we should reward them for working harder and reducing their total suffering.
Additionally we think that we'll just generally get higher skilled workers which improves our total economy.
For this reason, we should subsidize student loans."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should ban fast foods.
Three independent points.
First is that fast food is terribly unhealthy.
So I think this is fairly intuitive.
That we all understand why mcdonald's is bad.
These foods are generally rich in sodium, they have large amounts of trans fat, whatever the bad fat is, they're high in cholesterol, and they are low in nutrients.
They don't have much in the way of vitamins or other things that are actually healthy and important parts of a balanced diet.
So why then do we think that the government is justified in intervening in these problematic health decisions?
Two reasons.
First is that there's an information asymmetry intrinsic to these types of fast food.
That even if people understand to an extent that fast food is bad for you, they often do not understand how incredibly bad it is for you.
That a lot of people see it as like, oh well if I have like mcdonald's every night for dinner, that's like having like I don't know like red meat instead of white meat.
I think there are obviously lots of people, including like people like us who are disproportionately well educated, that really understand how bad this is for you, but I think generally speaking the people who consume it most are often the victims of ad campaigns that are designed to portray these types of food as equally healthy to things that are just mildly unhealthy.
But secondly, we think that there is going to be more access to healthy foods if you ban mcdonald's.
So a big part of the reason why poor families can't afford to eat healthy is because there is a premium on comparatively healthier foods.
That buying like raw fruits and vegetables and things like that is somewhat expensive by virtue of the fact that they're healthiness is a selling point.
But if you ban the comparatively unhealthy thing, that makes that a premium, then you decrease the market value of the healthy produce.
You bring down the price and you make it more affordable to families.
I think a good example of this is the fact that produce costs have gone up dramatically in the last few decades, mostly as a product of the widespread availability of cheap fast food.
If you get rid of the other force in the market that puts a premium on the healthy food, the prices go down and as a result become more affordable to poor individuals.
Our second independent point is the cultural harm that comes from fast food.
So we think that family meals where you sit down together and you spend time with your family are something that's really important.
That it strengthens the nuclear family structure when you are having this like daily interaction with your family members that forces that type of interaction and that type of structure.
And we think that the nuclear family is something that's very important, especially for children.
We think that it is something that provide structure to their lives and creates a stronger connection to individuals who have their best interests at mind.
And we think that generally speaking, it allows for support structures even for adults.
That's important to have that type of repetitive and reliable social interaction with people that you know are unconditionally attached to you.
We think that it is problematic then when that structure is weakened.
Our third independent point is wealth redistribution.
So franchises like fast food restaurants accumulate lots of money and then redirect that capital to people like say, ray kroc.
The comparative, small restaurants, generally accrue that capital to the middle class because those are the people that own these types of restaurants often.
So in this way, these small fast food joints drive inequity by funneling money from the lower classes and pushing it up to the uber rich.
Op is going to tell you that there's a trade-off here.
That the food will be pricier if it's smaller restaurants because of economies of scales and things like that.
I think we're comfortable though with that trade off insofar as we maintain capital in the lower classes, and stop the massive inequity that is being driven by institutions like the fast food industry.
Obviously this problem is bigger than the fast food industry, but we think this is still like a drop in the bucket that is moving in the right direction.
Proud to propose."
"We should ban organic food.
So in the status quo, in places like the united states and the european union you have government entities that label some food which is produced according to a long list of guidelines as organic.
So the only way that you're allowed to call your food organic is if you go down the sort of government checklist and meet every requirement and they presumably test your food to ensure that you do so.
So what we're arguing for on our side of debate is to get rid of this official label of organic for any given food.
Instead, we think that consumers should be able to read if something is produced according to certain natural methods, but that the actual term organic should not be used.
And certainly, nothing should replace it that's a similar government label that's indicative of this type of quality.
So three arguments.
The first is about why we think that organic labels drive up food costs.
So we tell you that it's much more lucrative to sell food to people who have more disposable income rather than less.
We see that, for instance, there are probably people in san francisco who can afford to pay a lot of money for a bag of rice, and people living in oakland who can pay a lot less money for a bag of rice, so you would always want to be the person producing for those wealthier consumers.
Now, the organic label is an excellent way to get someone to pay more money for effectively the same product.
We tell you that going down this checklist doesn't actually mean that you've done that much differently, just that you've avoided certain chemicals and likely substituted in other chemicals instead.
This may sound a little bit cynical, but most organic food is not coming straight from, you know, your grandfather's farm, it's coming from a massive agribusiness that's just as manipulative is any other food company so we tell you that because it's more lucrative you get fewer alternatives, because stores also want to stock the most profitable foods, which means these organic foods.
So they're taking up space that would otherwise go to regular, cheaper foods.
At that point I think that you get higher prices for the same foods, and that this is unacceptable because this makes it more difficult for people to have food security in their community.
Our second argument is about why we think this label is fundamentally misleading, and I suppose I've already hinted at this a little bit.
So there are no proven health benefits to so called organic food, and this makes a lot of sense when you think about what it actually is.
The USTA in america, or the EC in europe, basically just say you can't use any chemical on this list, and you have a few other requirements for how you store and treat this food.
So it doesn't make any sense that it would have any health benefits given that you're effectively eating the same thing minus a few safe chemicals that have already been approved for use in food these foods have the same nutritional value.
Now, it might be the case that one farmer has a strain of tomato with a little bit more vitamin a than another farmer strain of tomato, but at the end of the day these differences are insignificant when you account for the natural variation between foods because they're a product of nature.
We think therefore that this label is misleading because it exists to mislead consumers.
Basically, the companies that produce this organic food, these large companies like tyson and other agribusinesses, are implying to customers that organic food is healthier and more nutritious.
And even if they don't lie in their advertising, this seems apparent based on how people understand the word organic.
So we think that there's an imbalance in access to information between consumers and companies.
The companies know that the food is the same nutritionally as any other food, but the consumer thinks that they're getting something better.
At that point we feel like the government needs to step in and ban the use of this label because consumers are effectively being taken advantage of and can't protect themselves from these predatory businesses.
Our last argument is about why we think that the organic food label is actually harmful to small farmers.
So because this list is pretty long and requires you to use more expensive chemicals to grow your plants, or to raise livestock in particular, we think that most small farmers actually can't afford to meet these sort of arbitrary regulations for the organic label.
What is that mean?
Now, they can't compete in the gourmet food market, which we already told you is the most profitable food market, but on top of that, we think that they're likely to lose customers because people who probably would have bought produce at things like farmers markets and other places are now going to turn to other markets buying from large companies in order to get organic products thinking that it's healthier.
We think that many small farms will likely go under as they lose their consumer base, which is people with enough disposable income to buy from a small farm in the first place.
And this only strengthens and entrenches the power of large businesses.
And we think that this makes it likely that there will be less competition in the sphere of food production in the long run which ties back into what I told you earlier about driving up costs due to lack of competition.
So for these reasons, we should ban organic food."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should introduce compulsory voting.
First a little bit of modeling.
We think that this would basically consist of automatic voter registration.
Either we're going to have online ballots, or in the very least voting days going to be moved to a weekend.
Like we think that if we're introducing something compulsory were also going to make it as easy for people to access it as possible, and it's also going to be a situation in which like clearly this is in the united states and yeah.
So two main areas of clash: first on the alternation of societal specific norms.
So first we think that currently there's a massive problem with individuals being uninformed and apathetic about their local governments, and about their widespread elections.
They feel like their votes don't matter and they feel like they don't know enough to vote in the first place.
And currently people are okay with being like that because they know that they're not gonna vote and they've already kind of fooled themselves into believing that it wouldn't matter even if they did.
But when you actually place a pressure on these individuals, and you say that: "" look, you like you're going to have to vote when it comes down to it. ""
And you force them to face the fact that their vote will matter, we think there's much more pressure to remain informed, because you feel like you're actually going to be letting yourself and others down if you don't.
And so we think that people are going to start treating it much more like a duty and they're also going to be more pressure to inform on the part of political parties in the media.
Because if you're going to make something compulsory, and there's going to be large swathes of people who are going out who previously had not been, you're also going to have much more catering on the part of political political parties to those who they never really had faced before.
We also think that what we do on our side of the house is make voting a normal expectation.
Currently, people see voting as like a pleasant right.
It's like an option that they don't necessarily have to take, especially since they don't have to tell their friends that they didn't have to take it.
So what we would prefer is a world in which we saw voting as a specific duty that we have to do.
If we change the culture, we change the people around it as well.
So we think that as soon as we can instill this norm you're going to have much more enthusiasm about voting, you're going to have much more research about the political candidates and all that good stuff.
We also think that creating compulsory voting is likely to decrease national divisiveness.
A divided nation occurs in part because a part of that nation feels unheard and others don't reach out or recognize that they feel unheard.
But the part of the reason that they aren't recognizes because they tend not to say very much about it.
And we think that voting replaces that speech.
It allows them to stay silent without staying silent completely, because you're still going to start a conversation about this like change in the proportion of votes.
So we think that you'd actually be able to catch something like the current donald trump phenomena much earlier, because you're actually going to see people being forced to vote early on and you're going to see their political leanings and you're going to be able to ask why are we suddenly seeing this like massive demographic that has never voted like has always voted democratic or like has always been a third party, start to vote for like more extremist characters.
Our second area of clash has to do with achieving the most representative government.
Because in the end of the united states is a democracy and it doesn't want to represent the people who live within it.
So we think first that compulsory voting forces politicians to advertise to those historically disadvantaged and non voting populations.
Because currently all they have to do is isolate those populations that are most likely to vote and cater to them.
These populations tend to be the rich and like the upper middle class.
But now there's this massive new voting block and it forces politicians to inform them about what's going on because they want to have their vote.
It forces them to pass policy that these people are going to agree with because they need to have their vote.
We also think it decreases the power of money in the political system.
Currently giving cash basically gets you whatever you want, but if you have to get elected first, we think that you actually divert the attention for money to solid votes instead.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"We should ban racial profiling for two reasons.
First because it's a violation of rights and second because it actually makes people less safe.
So first, why is racial profiling a violation of rights?
Let's start by looking at the fact that it is an inherent rights violation.
Why is this true?
Because the because by the lottery of birth, people don't really have any control over where they're born into.
That's not something that you actually choose, you don't choose the color of your skin.
Or the religion that you grow up with, it's probably picked out by your parents.
So why do we think that this is important?
Because when you are profiling somebody on the base of their race, especially assuming criminality or terrorist motives to the basis of their race, or to a heightened presumption that they might be a perpetrator of such an action, it assigns blame to a race where it presumes blame onto a predominant group of people rather than assigning blame to individual people.
This is an incredibly big problem.
Because what it essentially is is a form of discrimination, because it means that the reason why someone is committing a crime is because they're a criminal because they have bad morals but that doesn't have anything to do with the color of their skin or the way in which they grew up.
But this is additionally yeah besides this just being an inherent rights violation we also believe that this will likely be a rights violation in the way that it's applied.
Why?
Because oftentimes police are able to take advantage of the leniency of society when it comes to safety measures.
This is very true in america, obviously, where you see shootings of unarmed black men on a tragically regular basis.
And that oftentimes convictions rarely if if ever follow and penalties are hardly ever more than a slap on the wrist.
This is clearly evident of a culture in which these things are permissible but additionally society also just scares easily.
You hear about instances of street harassment and bullying, acts of hate crimes against people, acts of hate crimes against muslims and islamophobia as rampant and these things are oftentimes stroked by media fears and when you and when you allow the use of racial profiling it essentially legitimizes that race can be a characteristic that could lead you wanting to identify somebody as a terrorist in the media and things like that.
So then I also think makes is like quite a violation of their rights because this is simply undeserved on their part.
But the next thing that I want to talk about is that I actually think that this makes society less safe.
Why is this true?
So first because it creates a presumption of where the threat is coming from, or expectation of who is actually threatening you that is ultimately not all that helpful in actually fighting threats.
Why?
Because terrorists and criminals belong to people of all races and religions and that just because some more happen to be come from some groups of people other than other groups of people when there is racial profiling allowed it usually focuses on the most prevalent groups.
This often comes at the expense of us not considering the threats that can come from people whom we may not expect them to come from.
So this ultimately makes you less safe in a lot of ways too.
But this is finally going to make people less safe because of the way in which the targeted groups of racial profiling react to this.
So even if you can make arguments that this isn't actually a violation of rights, the reality is is that the people involved in this, the people being targeted by this, do believe it is a rights violation.
What does this mean?
It means that it's just another example of society condemning these people who are already oftentimes not treated very well in society at large so I think that if anything this is going to make it more likely that people are going to, on the margins, turn to extremism or terrorism or more radical sects altogether.
And this is because they're going to be seen as less accepted by mainstream society.
They're not going to ever feel like they're secure in their own identity.
This is an incredibly this is incredibly messed up thing and it ultimately only makes it our society less safe and less secure.
So for all of those reasons we should definitely ban racial profiling."
"We should subsidize electric cars.
So in this debate we're not talking about hybrid cars like a prius, we're talking about fully electric cars like the tesla.
And I think that we're talking about countries that already have a domestic industry surrounding these cars.
So places like the US, like germany, like japan, that are already manufacturing electric cars today.
So with that in mind we have two main points.
The first, it's about the environment and the second is about domestic industry.
So in terms of the environment, we think it's clear that we need to move towards electric cars in order to reduce the use of fossil fuels.
We see that transportation is one of the primary drivers of fossil fuel emissions in the status quo.
People are using way too much gasoline to get work every day and we could drastically reduce that by using electric cars.
Why is this true?
First of all energy production at the grid bubble is much more effective.
So in terms of actually reducing carbon emissions the grid is already much cleaner than any individual car.
In countries like the US, germany, japan, you have a mix of alternative energies playing into that grid and you also the use of things like natural gas, you're not just burning a bunch of gasoline.
So we see that we need people to be driving electric cars and the way to do that is to reduce the cost.
If you make it so that a tesla costs about the same amount as you know, a new ford then people are going to be much more likely to be willing to buy the tesla.
But on top of that, we tell you that you can also facilitate the development of new technology that will benefit the environment in the future.
By subsidizing electric cars you don't just get cars at the end.
You get better batteries, you get a better understanding of alternative fuel sources, you get people who are doing research into other sustainable uses of this technology.
So ultimately we think that although you put a lot of money into this one project, the benefits will disperse widely.
If you want an example of how this has worked in the past, think about the moon landing.
It's actually useless to send a man to the moon but the technology that we got from that, things like microwaves, things like ballpoint pens, all of these great things that we have today that make our lives better, are a result of that one project.
We think that investing heavily in electric cars could have a similar spillover affect.
Our second point is about domestic industry.
So when you subsidize electric cars in your own country you put a lot of money into research and development in your country.
We think this means that more young people will go into those fields that are being subsidized.
So you'll have more engineers, more scientists, all these other things which will ultimately make your country more competitive in the long term in the high tech sector and in automotives as well.
We also see that by subsidizing this you're going to see increased production of electric cars.
Which means that you'll create manufacturing jobs.
Recognize that manufacturing for subsidized industries like defense is already a major source of good, union jobs in countries like the US and germany that have large arms industry.
We just want to extend that into the civilian sphere through electric cars.
And on top of that, we think that you're also going to have a new industry bloom up in order to service all of these electric cars.
Right now very few people are licensed or able to service electric cars but if you put millions more of them on the road through subsidies, than we think that ultimately you're going to see an industry crop up that will create new jobs for people to supply and service these cars.
Now the other team might tell you that by putting all of this money into subsidies you're helping people who already have enough money, who don't really need any help, because the lowest income people aren't going to be purchasing electric cars.
But we think that the benefits to the environment and the job benefits created will ultimately help some of those who are in a difficult economic position right now.
There will be more good jobs for people without a college degree from this manufacturing and also more opportunities for people to go on to do higher education as a result of these subsidies for things like engineering and so on.
So for these two reasons, the both benefits to the environment and benefits to domestic industry, we should subsidize electric cars.
Thank you."
"We should subsidize biofuels.
So, biofuels, for those who aren't aware, are fuels similar to gas or diesel, which are made from plant material, as opposed to you know fuels that are taken out of the ground as minerals.
So ethanol, for instance, is generally made from corn, in countries like the US and brazil.
Biodiesel is made from various sources and is more popular in the european union and india.
So, with this in mind, we think that there are two main reasons why they should be subsidized, and you know by subsidize we think that the state should make it less expensive to produce these biofuels, through tax credits and things like that.
Too big arguments.
The first is about sustainable growth.
So, to start out with: any country's economic growth is dependent on their ability to access cheap energy.
What does this mean?
If your country relies heavily on gasoline or diesel, then your growth is going to be stunted in the long term, because the cost of those energy sources will only increase as they become more scarce.
There's a finite amount of crude oil in the ground from which to make these fuels, which means that as we extract more and more oil from the ground, it will become more expensive in the long term.
Scientist fifteen years ago thought there would be something called peak oil, where oil would get so expensive no one could afford it anymore.
That seems to have been averted by the invention of fracking, and the discovery of other oil sources, but it does seem that, you know, if you're thinking forty to fifty years down the line, it's much better to invest in an energy source that replenishes itself, rather than one which will run out, even if it doesn't run out for another two hundred years.
On top of that though, we think you should subsidize it because it promotes growth in terms of your economy, we see that this is a new industry which is booming.
The infrastructure that you create, by subsidizing the production of biofuels, is going to be useful infrastructure over the long term.
If you build more oil refineries, or if you more extraction facilities, say if the US and mexico continue to extract more and more oil from the gulf of mexico, those facilities are fundamentally useless once you've extracted the oil from underneath them, and eventually they'll all be useless, when we run out of oil to begin with.
If you invest in plants refined corn though, well, corn hopefully isn't going anywhere, we'll be able to produce energy with this infrastructure for hundreds of years, or to build off of it, to build and develop even better future infrastructure and discovering new technologies, that will let us use this technology even more efficiently.
So ultimately, we think you should subsidize biofuels, because it will promote sustainable long term development within your country.
Our second argument for why you should subsidize biofuels is to promote self sufficiency for your country, in terms of energy as opposed to imports.
Remember that, only a few countries in the world actually produce all of the oil that they use.
Even a country like america, or a country like mexico, both of which produce lots of oil, still import oil from other countries like venezuela.
We see that many of the world's largest economies, like china, have virtually no oil production, or very little compared to their consumption, so they're very dependent on imports.
We think that, you should subsidize biofuels because you can produce them in your own country, which means that the wealth that they create, and also the money that you would have spent on imports, now stays in your own economy.
Effectively, this is a way to promote reinvestment, because, for instance, in china if they were to subsidize these biofuels, that would be capital that's being put back into china, paying chinese laborers rather than going to russia or mexico to buy oil.
We think that, on top of that, for countries which rely heavily on oil, subsidizing these biofuels will give them a path to remain sustainable in the future.
A country like russia that is basically a petro state, can guarantee their future economic stability, by supporting this business to replace the oil industry, once that is no longer sustainable.
So for these reasons, we should subsidize biofuels.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should legalize sex selection.
What we mean by this is that we would allow parents to use techniques such as microsorting and genetic testing to predetermine whether the fetuses that they're going to be implanting, either into the body or raising from a test tube, are going to be of a specific gender, and then based on those results, we would allow parents to throw away or not or choose not to use a fetus that is of a specific, to them personally, undesirable gender.
For the purpose of this debate, we're going to be talking about men versus women given that it is very difficult to distinguish at the beginning of a baby's birth whether or not they're going to end up being non-binary or trans or anything like that.
Two main areas of clash, first on the rights of parents.
We think that generally people have a right to choose the characteristics of the child that they're going to raise.
They're going to give up so much of their life, money, energy and time, like bringing this child into the world and making sure that they are growing up in a healthy like hopefully happy, hopefully well up provided for home, and as such, we think you you should probably be able to select what where that money and energy and time is going to go.
We think that forms of this are already allowed in the status quo.
We can choose all of our child's influences: what they watch, what they're going to wear, who they're friends with who their teachers oftentimes like where they live, all of these things, and we're just unclear on why there's a specific higher standing for changing your child's genetics with respect to gender.
We actually think it's the burden on opp in this round to show to us why gender and genetics are so much more important than things like where you go to school and like what the main influences in your life are going to be.
In fact, we think that there's actually no difference at all, given that there have been confirmed links between genetic data and the kind of environment that we grow up in, ie, the environment that we have might stimulate our DNA to methylate or phosphorylate, which then change the expression of certain genes.
So, at the point that we literally already allow parents to essentially change and direct their children's genes, we don't know why this is so much more different, and we think that it's naturally stemming from the rest of their rights.
We also think that a child is very much a personal investment on the part of the parents.
Any investment that someone makes is one that you hope to be profitable and one that you need to include your preference, right?
Like, I'm not going to invest my money in a bank or a corporation that I do not believe in or that I think is going to fail.
And so we think that children are very similar in that you don't want to invest all of that energy and all of that time and all of that pain in a child that like maybe you didn't necessarily want or a has certain characteristics that are going to keep it from being able to rise higher in the world.
Like maybe you just really think that women are going to do better than men or vice versa.
Our second area of clash is about mitigating negative outcomes.
Recognize that anyone who cares so passionately about the gender of their child in a world where sex selection is illegal is likely to attempt an abortion either way, right?
Like at the point that they're willing to threaten to do this, to look for means to do this, if they were going to do it on our side of the house, they're likely to still find a way to do so on the opposition side of the house, and we think that this oftentimes takes much more pernicious ways.
Like, recognize that when china instituted the one-child policy, you had a lot of female babies just getting left in the woods after they were born because their parents didn't want them, and they wanted to be able to have another child afterwards.
But, like, recognize that even if we managed to force people to keep these children, it is very likely that they're going to mistreat the child.
Given that they didn't want it in the first place, they don't feel an obligation to take care of it.
We think that you're actually doing a favor to any child who's coming out of these circumstances by making sure that these people are not the ones who are going to be raising it in the long term.
We also think that in more moderate situations, there isn't incentive to misuse it because there's less of a conception that one gender is preferable to the other.
Like, recognize that there are perfectly good reasons that maybe you don't want to have a child of a certain gender.
Some diseases that are really specific to men or women can be cut out almost entirely in this way, and parents who are carriers don't have to worry if they're able to sex select.
And maybe you want another kid but you already have multiple boys or multiple girls.
We think it's fair for you to then say, "" I'm done with this group.
I want a different kind. ""
For these reasons, proud to propose."
