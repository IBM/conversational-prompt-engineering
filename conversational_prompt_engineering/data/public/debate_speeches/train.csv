"The motion for today's debate is that we should protect the free market.
What we mean by this is that we prefer a world in which governments minimize punitive taxes such as those created to discourage consumption such as the tax on cigarettes or taxes on marijuana in a lot of states, taxes on alcohol and minimize government subsidies.
So what we mean by that is like the government will often subsidize certain types of fuel production we would eliminate as much of those as possible.
Both of these are tools that artificially manipulate the market and so we prefer a world in which there was less manipulations, the free market could solve for problems on its own.
Two main areas of clash, first on how it encourages innovation.
Recognize first and foremost that innovation is something that's difficult and stressful product process.
It requires a lot of start up capital, long hours, the freedom from government regulations to engage in that kind of research in the first place, and without the free market the government controls the means of production which poses two problems to innovation.
First only things that the government wants get produced ie if you live in a very liberal or conservative state the kind of things that will regard like due to like based on the government's affiliation the kind of things more likely to be produced will be skewed based on that political affiliation regardless of what the majority of individuals desire.
But second it only uses government resources so once there is no more government funding or if that government funding is getting prioritized into different piles there's only so much of it and past that amount you cannot like add, right?
This is bad because the government will never have enough resources or allocate them well enough for all the necessary or good stuff we need.
But it also means that even if they decide that something is going to be necessary or good, it isn't necessarily the case that consumers are going to want that product.
So the cool thing about the free market is that you don't run the risk of millions of dollars wasted on something that isn't going to do well because consumers will just illustrate early on that's not a product that is desirable.
Whereas in the case of the government producing something like this the government just keeps going and it's too late to like undo all of those resources and consumers are just kind of stuck with it.
If we want people to take risk personally and financially to start lick corporations, to do research, and technology innovation we have to have an incentive that makes all of this pain and suffering worth it.
That incentive is monetary success in a free market system but otherwise doesn't exist other than like maybe arbitrary prestige that people don't really care about especially when it's at the cost of hours and hours of stress and like massive risk to themselves.
So we think that the government can never provide as much as much as private investors can and we think the things that these individuals do in a free market are really really important.
These are the people who are responsible for things like drug development, technology research, like the fact that we have things like anything from epipens to smartphones all depends on the existence of a free market that not only allows individuals tools to initially create this but also creates a world in which they are capable of competing with other corporations to make sure that the end result product is the best possible.
So we actually think that competing for money creates competition which creates better products which creates a better world for consumers.
But our second area of clash is about why this is most democratic.
Recognize the free market depends on consumer interest.
Product won't take products won't take off if no one wants to buy them so it gives the majority of power to consumers rather than government because because society will reflect what the majority desires.
This means that people's physical needs are often taking care of.
It also means that consumers control the price so necessities are much less likely to be incredibly expensive because the demand for them is so high that it there are multiple corporations all working on providing them at a reasonable price.
I think a really good example of why the free market solves for such things would be the soviet union which regardless of the fact that so many people had demand for bread the fact that the government only had a limited amount of resources to split between all different needs meant that individual starve like starved over time because the government couldn't provide all of that.
So we think it's actually incredibly important that the free market exists and be protected.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban casinos.
Three main areas of clash, first on why casinos are just a different kind of addiction that ought be banned in the same way that we regulate things like heroin or cocaine or any kind of other addictive drug.
Recognize that like chemically and scientifically as it has been studied gambling has been shown to just be as big of an addiction as cigarettes to like cocaine and heroin.
The advertisers often specifically put their advertisements in poor areas in this pray on individuals that already don't have very much money and oftentimes like don't have the same kind of indoctrination into why why gambling is so bad and so I think that is like uniquely a way which they take advantage of individuals as well but also we think that it like it brings people in by promising large rewards that never actually occur insofar as people are often set to lose thousands and thousands more dollars than they could ever have potentially gained.
The important thing to remember here is that this money trades off with the resources that individuals need for their families.
It become like not only are they no longer providing in a financial way but now that they have contracted was essentially an incredibly deadly disease, this is something that the family needs to provide treatment for and support for.
This is harmful both to the individual and their like directly related family but it's also really bad for society when rather than like spending your money within your region and like on things that trickle down to other people and stimulate economic activity, you sit in a casino all day and only spend money on like that bracket so that a certain group of people are the only ones who benefit off of it.
We think that that's actually quite bad but more than this like bringing us to our second independent point, I think it's important to recognize what kind of behavior casinos actually like encourage and impose.
We think a lot of the time what happens is that casinos promote disinhibited behavior that often involve substance abuse especially they bring in like harsher forms of drugs and prostitutes to fuel the behavior that we've already identified can be incredibly problematic.
This is bad because it raised the level of crime but it is also bad because it makes the areas more dangerous.
The correspondence that occurs there then is that as the like dangerousness in the area rises the prices of the area and like the land and the property become a lot lower which causes more well-off people to leave ie white flight but also forces individuals who do not have the money to leave and just lost a lot of money on their house to be stuck in these awful situations that they can never get out of so we think that's like actually quite bad and so we should never put a city in the position of having to avoid this kind of drainage.
But our third independent point is about economic depression because recognize that a lot of the time casinos tend to depress economically the areas surrounding them.
This is true because casinos are like a like three-inp-one in that they will often provide a restaurant, they will provide overnight like overnight utilities and overnight beds and entertainment in just one large area.
This drives other competing businesses in the region out of business given that no one actually wants to have to leave the casino being inebriated to go get food or to go get other kinds of entertainment and and so this like after and after that occurs in like smaller businesses in the area are driven out because they have a monopoly the casinos can jack up their prices and provide an undue economic influence over the region as a whole.
This a problem because it allows things for political lobbying to go through much more quickly if a like certain congressman or whatever thinks that they are a like more likely to lose should do not support this.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"We should abolish the olympic games.
So, I'm sure everyone here is familiar with the olympics, they're held every four years for summer sports, and then alternating for winter sports.
We would argue that the olympic should be abolished.
So, three arguments for our side.
The first is that the olympics lose a fortune for their host cities.
Since the nineteen eighty four olympics in los angeles, no olympic host has turned a significant profit on hosting.
Indeed, many olympics, like the ones held in athens, have actually done serious damage to the financial stability of the host country.
We would tell you that, ultimately, there is no reason to continue hosting the olympics, which ultimately are an event for entertainment, when it's effectively a huge white elephant for the country that receives it.
Cities are pressured into hosting, because they feel like this is the best way to increase their international standing, but then once they actually do, they get lots of media attention for a few weeks during the summer, when the olympics is held, and then suddenly they're left with billions of dollars of useless infrastructure, that doesn't actually do anything to help their people.
We think that this money would be better spent on developing useful infrastructure, building metros that people would actually ride, instead of ones that connect hotels to stadia for instance.
But on top of that, we think that it's just unethical for governments to spend their money on the olympics.
Because government funds are fungible, this is all money that isn't being spent on things like schools, and social welfare.
So, we think that states should not be investing in the olympics, and that, ultimately, that's the only way that they're possible is heavy public subsidy.
Even though large companies, like coke and mcdonalds, sponsor the olympics, ultimately governments provide the vast amount of the money to actually host them.
Our second argument is that the olympics glorify amateurism, in a way that we think is ultimately harmful.
In most sports in the olympics, excepting basketball and a couple of others, you have to be an amateur in order to be able to compete.
What this means is that the highest level of competition, for many sports around the world, does not pay the athletes.
Now, it may be true that a country's ministry of sport might feed and house people, while they train for the olympics, but these are people who could, on the free market, presumably sell lots of tickets, and bring in lots of money for their own benefit, instead of the IOC's benefit, if it weren't for this glorification of amateurism.
Because of the olympics, we would argue, many sports, like weight lifting, like gymnastics, don't allow the athletes to support themselves and generate a good income, based on their talent and hard work.
These athletes are working as hard as anybody in the NBA or the champions league, so we don't see why they shouldn't be able to use their skills and talents to earn lots of money.
But, because the olympics are so fetishized, ultimately that's what people care about, and these athletes are forced to be amateurs, if they want to be able to compete at the highest level.
Our third and final argument is that the olympics prioritize certain sports unfairly.
The sports that are included in the olympics tend to be sports, that were developed in the united states, or western europe, especially england.
Things, like sports developed by native americans, or sub saharan african people, are almost entirely absent.
Yes, lacrosse is sometimes included in the olympics, but that's the only example that you can really point to.
We think that this means, that countries are encouraged to ignore their traditional sports and games, to focus on american or european sports and games, because the international community has agreed, that those are the ones that are worthy of being celebrated at the highest international level.
We think that it's unfortunate, that countries are spending more money on western gymnastics or basketball, than they are on the sports that their ancestors played, because ultimately it's likely that if we don't encourage those cultural traditions, that they'll die out, and everyone is poorer if we lose access to our shared cultural heritage.
For these reasons, we should abolish the olympics.
Thank you."
"We should further exploit solar energy.
By this we mean that governments should devote significant funds to researching more efficient or better forms of solar panels and solar technology, that we should devote large resources to developing better battery technology so that we can save up the energy that we harvest from the sun, and that municipalities should seek to transfer publicly owned electricity companies away from fossil fuels and away from other types of energy toward solar energy in the short to medium term.
We have a few arguments for why we think it's essential that we further exploit solar energy.
The first is that there is an imperative right now to reduce carbon emissions, and solar energy is an effective way to do it.
The first part of this argument is about that imperative to reduce emissions.
Many major cities are going to be seriously threatened by climate change.
New york, london, rio de janeiro, and many of the world's other largest cities will be flooded by climate change in the next hundred years or so.
In order to allow ourselves to have time to adapt to the effects of climate change, we need to reduce the rate at which it occurs.
The only way that we can reduce the rate at which climate change occurs would be to reduce our carbon emissions since, ultimately, carbon emissions compound with one another such that if there are higher emissions now and in the future, it will create an exponential increase in the temperature.
This is the source of the famous hockey stick graph, if you've ever seen the old al gore movie about climate change.
But aside from this, we also think that it's important because in the short to medium term, we have the ability to create change.
We have this imperative to do something, and solar panels uniquely offer us a way to do that without creating further problems down the line.
Wind power is very expensive and inefficient, so investing in that would be a bad investment.
Nuclear power has political problems and ultimately disposing of the waste can be difficult, so it's obvious that solar power is probably the best way given the technology that we have to cope with climate change.
Therefore, we need to drastically increase the amount of solar power that we harvest and use.
But our second argument for why we should do this is that it would let countries be more energy independent.
Right now, a few countries, like the united states or mexico, are energy independent.
They produce more energy than they import.
Most countries, though, such as germany or britain, have to import huge amounts of energy in the form of oil or buying electricity from their neighbors in order to support their populace.
That means that these countries are subject to the volatility of the international energy market.
For instance, when the ruble crashed, that created huge shocks in oil prices a few years back which greatly affected all of europe because they were depending on russia to provide them with oil and with natural gas.
If countries like czech republic or germany had been using solar energy instead, then they wouldn't rely on foreign, especially russian, energy in order to provide for their people.
This is good for a few reasons.
One: it makes it easier for governments to subsidize access to energy so that pensioners or low-income people don't have to worry about being able to afford heating, since the government can now control the rate more easily without relying on import prices.
Two: it reduces volatility, which I've already spoken a little bit about, so that even if there is a crash in something's value, your people don't have to go without electricity potentially.
And three: it promotes a domestic industry that can never be outsourced.
Jobs in maintaining your own energy infrastructure can never be sent to india or china, so ultimately this ensures that you'll have high quality jobs for engineers and scientists and also jobs for all the people who work at these plants, these good blue-collar jobs.
So ultimately, this is obviously to a country's interest and we should further exploit solar energy.
Thank you."
"The free market should be protected.
By this we mean that government should intervene in order to prevent anti-market behavior from private actors.
We think that for instance, anti-trust laws should be upheld in order to prevent any one actor from gaining a huge monopoly and using it to prevent free exchange and fair contracts and the like.
For instance, we think that bell telephone, which had a phone monopoly in the united states for many decades, actually posed a threat to the free market because they were able to use their monopoly status to prevent any other company from competing in the american telephone market.
We're going to talk about three pillars of what we see as the free market system, and how we ought protect them.
We think that the first pillar that you need to consider is the possibility of fair competition.
The free market relies on the idea that the best company, or the best product, or the best idea will win out over others because people will choose to consume it.
But obviously this is only true if they're able to compete on somewhat equal footings.
Even if I invented a very good toaster oven, if there were a company that had a monopoly on toaster ovens that prevented any store from selling mine, then no one would be able to have better toast as a result of my product.
So that wouldn't really be a free market.
We think therefore, that you need to have things like anti-trust laws that prevent monopolistic behavior.
If for instance one company is very good at making mattresses and they use that to leverage the selling of their toasters by threatening not to sell mattresses unless stores also sell their toaster exclusively, then you don't really have any competition.
Ultimately we need to prevent trust from existing so that people are able to bring new ideas to the market.
One of the great strengths of the free market is that you have innovation and an incentive for people to work hard.
But monopolistic behavior prevents innovation because once you have a monopoly there's no incentive to provide a better product.
We saw this with bell telephone.
American telephony was far behind western europe or other parts of the developed world for many decades because there was no incentive to improve once big bell had their monopoly.
Our second argument is about protecting contracts.
One of the most fundamental parts of the free market system is that contracts are enforceable.
What does this mean?
If I say that I will sell you a certain number of toasters then you can guarantee that I have to do that or that you will be compensated by the courts.
You're able to go to a civil court and ultimately get what you're owed according to a fair freebie signed contract.
But what happens when one party is much more powerful than any other?
Ultimately monopolistic companies, which we argue are likely to emerge without regulation, would be able to enforce unfair contracts.
They would have have so much more bargaining power than anyone with whom they bargained that no one would be able to be sure that contracts would actually be fulfilled.
They would be able to bury people in court to prevent things from ever being heard in court and ultimately prevent contracts from underlying the system.
In doing so you would make it much more difficult to do business and actually undermine the free market.
So we think it's essential that the state intervene in order to ensure that contracts are fair and that they're actually upheld regardless of the power of one of the parties involved.
Our final point is about encouraging exchange.
In order for the free market to succeed people have to think that it's worth their while to invest in the market and ultimately to participate therein.
If there's no way for people to make money because of monopolistic or anti-competitive behavior by certain actors, then ultimately people are going to exchange with each other in other ways outside of the general market.
This will make it more difficult for out groups such as ethnic minorities to participate in free exchange.
So we think it's important that the government encourage people to participate in the market system in order to ensure its long term success and in order to ensure access by all different groups.
For all of these reasons the free market should be protected.
Thank you."
"We should further exploit nuclear power.
When we say we're going to further exploit nuclear power, this includes allowing for subsidies to occur, that and increase the investment in nuclear power, allowing for tax breaks that allow for nuclear power to be more prolific, and more business friendly, and more economically viable for new entrepreneurs to enter the field, and start developing this power.
You would also increase the regulatory capacity of the state, so that these things can be put out, and used more frequently, and overall we would ensure that there are structures in place, for a robust use of nuclear power within the state.
Okay, so two main arguments, the first is that there is a massive potential, that resides within the use of nuclear power, and the second is to explain why, in the context of other power options, nuclear power is not as dangerous as the popular imaginary beliefs.
Okay, firstly, on its potential.
Recognize that, nuclear power has the ability to use a very small amount of fuel to establish a massive amount of power.
This can be used in small nuclear reactors, that can power city blocks, and it can be used in large reactors, that can power entire cities and entire areas for a long period of time, creating yes, nuclear waste, that needs to be dealt with, but also this waste can be contained, and used and contained in a way, that it doesn't necessarily, and it's not intrinsic to it, in creating these harms.
This is what's especially important about nuclear power is that it's flexible.
So, it is one, there is no nuclear fallout, a safe resource and a safe way of gathering energy, and it's a much more flexible than other types of reusable energy, renewable energy resources that we have.
So for example, unlike solar power, it doesn't require being in a place that has an immense exposure to daylight.
Unlike wind power, it's not reliant on of been located in a certain area, which means that it's geographically viable in all locations, and it's versatile in such a way, where it is a sustainable energy source, that, if perfected, is going to, in the long run, be more versatile, and more useful, in a wide variety of areas, in ways that, no matter how much you perfect solar power, it's unlikely to be useful in areas, that have very long winters, or do not get exposed to sunlight on a regular basis.
We also think think that it could be scaled down, and for for smaller use in ways that ensure sure that, it can be particularized to the area in which it's being used.
So secondly, we think that the danger of nuclear power is dramatically overblown.
While the while popular narratives about nuclear reactor meltdowns, and things like this, are popular in our imaginary, in our social consciousness, what's important to recognize is that, based on the amount of usage, so based on the the prolific nature of its use, it's actually the case that, there is more degradation, and more damage done from oil spills per the amount of drilling operations, and different transporting operations, than there is from nuclear power.
So yes, it's natural that, because there is more oil being used that there would be more spills than there are nuclear power meltdowns, but the damage done by these things, in proportion to their prevalence, is actually much higher in using these fossil fuels.
Given that this is the case, we think the stigma around nuclear power plants is massively overblown.
Given that we are willing to take on the dramatic ramifications of oil spills, which include polluting water supplies, damaging, almost permanently, environments and ecosystems that are in these areas, we think that we should be willing to take on the risk of nuclear power, given the prolific and versatile nature that it has.
There's also an immense amount of room for innovation in nuclear power, that hasn't been tapped in the status quo, because of the fact that, there's this massive stigma against it, and allowing for nuclear power, allowing for the development of this resource, would allow for energy independence for all states.
It would mean that, if you can perfect nuclear power, because you can use it in any location, it isn't reliant on on mining for resources that simply cannot be reproduced, on oil that is going to damage the environment, in a way that nuclear power simply will not, we think that there are massive benefits to be gained, and the risks are much smaller than people make them out to be.
Given that this is the case, we should further exploit nuclear power."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should further exploit nuclear power.
We being global governments across the world and exploiting meaning heavy investment into nuclear research and power and the building of power plants.
Two main areas of clash, the first on general prose of nuclear power.
We tell you, first, it is infinitely cheaper than any of our alternatives.
Recognize that going from oil that needs to be dug up requires expensive rigs, gas that needs the same kind of investment as oil and can only be provide by certain governments that control the price, even to things like wind where large turbines need to be built and controlled, all of these things are infinitely cheaper with something like nuclear power.
Where once you have the initial plant built all you need is materials that can be produced within labs for relatively low prices.
Especially as more groups of people provide more research and these corporations can compete with each other.
More than this we tell you that nuclear power plants are infinitely renewable.
You don't have to wait millions of years for plant matter to compact, you don't even have to wait for the corn to grow out, as is the way for things like bio-fuels.
But we also say that it's not as environmentally damaging as any of these alternatives that often create harmful by products that keep up the that damage the environment and make it more difficult to breathe.
We also tell you that the main argument against nuclear power plants is just false.
People say that it's so dangerous and chernobyl happened.
The problem with this is that chernobyl happened is a one percent chance risk a hundred years ago at a time where it was first technology that was much less developed but also in a time where these kind of safety regulations wasn't warrant as employed.
We tell you that learning from chernobyl allows us to create nuclear power plants that are almost impossible to fail.
That allow us to build out of materials that prevent exposure to nuclear fallout, that allow us to put in safety buttons that shut down the plant at the moment that there seems to be a problem.
We think that this kind of risk is immensely outweighed in so far the one percent chance of this nuclear power plant failing is much less than the fact that it can supply millions of people with energy and that one country can be powered by one large reactor.
But more than this we think that nuclear reactors generate important jobs and research.
We think it's good for our economy to invest in something like nuclear energy especially since oil and gas run out and get more expensive by the day that they run out.
We think at the point that you can invest in something that is renewable and invest in your own corporations to develop that this is necessarily positive for economies.
But we also think it's good for collaboration insofar as governments can collaborate with each others each other and research centers can move across nations in order to work on better technology.
Our second main area of clash has to do with why we don't have a choice.
We tell you there's not enough oil and gas, that bio-fuels are also not as easily renewable and take up more energy, and that things like wind energy and sun energy require for the wind and the sun to be present in order to use them.
We tell you that unlike them, nuclear power applies across the globe equally.
Regardless of whether you are in norway, where the sun never shines, or in south africa where the wind is very low.
We think that it's important to note that nuclear energy uniquely provides a way for which all governments, all areas across the globe can be powered.
But more than this, we tell you that eventually those developing countries will want to be fully developed.
The main reason that we still have gas in the status quo is because countries in africa and countries in east asia don't use as much power because they are not as developed as current first world countries.
We tell you the moment that these countries fully develop, provide power to all of their citizens, and invest in things like wifi that reaches across the globe, we lose out on the fact that they don't use as much power and the world power and the world's power consumption goes up massively.
We tell you we need to be prepared for this moment and the only way to do so is by investing in something like nuclear power that actually allows countries to develop fully without fear of harming everyone around them.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"Casinos bring more harm than good for two big reasons: first, because casinos are just a way to trick people into spending more and more of their money on something that is never going to actually help them, really, and secondarily because casinos bring in a lot of associated crime, a lot of associated problems directly.
So let's start by talking about casinos themselves because I think that it's important to note that casinos are not just the same thing as gambling.
I think casinos are uniquely, as an institution, bad because they are designed in such a way to make money to make money off people and in order for them to make money off of people they necessarily have to bring in more money than they give out.
So when people are gambling their money it's not just something like it's like a fifty fifty chance, or it's not something like an investment where you are likely going to be able to get something about or you're actually making like a skilled assessment.
It's, essentially your wagering your money for, like, something that's very very unlikely actually going to give you any kind of pay out.
But in addition to the fact that the odds are almost certainly going to be against you, there's also an incentive to keep waving that pile of money in front of you at these institutions.
Keep drawing you in to play one more time.
To like give it one more go, if the hope that maybe that time, that will be the time that you win.
But it does not work out like that.
That's not the way in which you actually persuade.
That is not the way in which you actually like make money and I think that that's inherently bad.
So the next thing that I want to talk about is associated crime because casinos directly bring in people like, you can look at places like las vegas as an example of this, casinos directly first bring in crime via drinking, because it's like public drinking or wide spread getting drunk because, well, as often times I think it's associated with gambling.
So all of the crime that is associated with drunkenness, be it DUI's or violence, violent behavior sometimes, things like that.
All of those harms as are associated with drunkenness are also associated with casinos as well.
But I think in addition to that casinos also kind of fostering a general norm of not to say sin, but like a general norm of like things that people do that are less than savory.
So when people tend to go to a place like las vegas, for example, you go there for the gambling but there's also oftentimes widespread like prostitution rings there and things like that, there's oftentimes like widespread drugs and things like that as well.
So, there is an association of like a lot of crime with casinos as well besides the actual crime themselves.
So finally, I think that it's important to compare all of these harms to the benefits of casinos because casinos aren't really something that's actually necessary for anything like that.
They're just like a way in which people can be entertained.
But, casinos as an institution aren't the way in which people have to gamble.
Maybe you can gamble with like online poker or or do something with your friends instead.
Like I think the casinos are just a uniquely bad manifestation of some of the worst impulses of people and the worst abuses of people.
So for all those reasons, very proud to propose this motion."
"We should abolish the olympics because the olympics are a waste of money, they are really bad for a lot of developing countries, and, in a lot of ways, they're pretty rigged and unfair anyways so they're not really all that interesting.
So let's start by talking about why they're just a waste of money.
And the big starter here is that they cost of billions of dollars whether it's the cost of hosting it, the cost of building stadiums, the cost of like a lot of logistics, the the cost of all the other kinds of things that pop up when you're talking about like a global event of international importance.
This costs billions of dollars.
And it's basically billions of dollars for a sporting event and I like sports a lot I think that they're fun and I watch the olympics.
But you can't possibly say that these billions of dollars that we spend on the olympics are more important than spending billions of dollars on malaria nets, billions of dollars on people struggling in food and security areas, billions of dollars on making sure that people have access to clean drinking water or shelter or things like that.
We could literally be spending these billions of dollars on almost anything else that's more important of international importance or give it to an international charity.
So that's like a good place to start right off the bat about why this is just a bad way to allocate resources.
But, beyond that, I think this is also really bad for developing countries because developing countries are oftentimes hosting these events so whether is like the brazil olympics or I guess like some extent russia, although not as much, like a lot of developing countries host the olympics and spend a whole lot of money on that.
And that's a big problem because a lot of governments do it for the wrong reasons.
They do it for prestige, they do it for the perception of importance and power and wealth, and they do that at the expense of the actual people on the ground.
So you can see like indigenous areas get like slums getting cleared out and people's homes getting cleared out because they don't look attractive for international populations, billions of dollars of public resources being spent on stadiums that are never going to be used again, like or transportation projects that are largely useless rather than useful transportation projects, so all things that are really bad for a lot of countries and things like that.
But the final thing is that the sports themselves are oftentimes unfair and anti-climactic.
And they're anti-climactic in the way that they have largely predictable results and these largely predictable result come from the fact that you're probably likely going to have success if you have a couple of things: one, if you're just a larger population.
If you have a large population you're probably going to win a lot more things so that kind of makes it like a whole lot that probably makes it more unfair.
Also if you have money to spend on things, if you have money to train athletes, if you have money to spend on resources for athletes to come up with like long development programs, and also the money to essentially allow athletes to spend more time focusing on their athletics then having to worry about like jobs and other kinds of things like that.
So I think that obviously like wealthier countries are at like a big disadvantage and that's like pretty unfair in a lot of ways.
So for all those reasons you should get rid of the olympics."
"We should further exploit solar energy.
Solar energy is an essential tool in the ongoing fight against global warming.
Since the early two thousands, it's been incredibly effective.
It's allowed individuals who've installed them on their homes to pay little to no money in power bills every single month.
In many areas, individuals with solar panels are able to sell their excess energy to the state in order to recoup their costs at startling speeds.
Their unpopularity, their lack of overall integration into our society can be blamed largely on the goals of corporations, on the active misinformation campaigns of large fossil fuel firms who have generally harmed the entirety of the world in their fight against renewable energy.
Because we think that there is incredible benefits to be gained from solar energy, that are not currently, we would support the following model: that we substantially subsidize research and production of solar panels such that their cost is massively decreased.
We think that the average individual should be able to afford solar panels installed on their homes using about the amount of money that they would spend on power in a given year.
Three arguments for why this is a good idea: first, on global warming.
We think that solar panels are largely effective in solving global warming.
A massive amount of our total energy usage comes from corporations and comes from the resource extraction and burning of fossil fuels.
Huge amounts of CO two come from these kinds of efforts.
We think that global warming can be solved through solar panels, both as individuals stop consuming oil and as firms find it considerably cheaper to install solar panels on their buildings, decreasing our dependence on fossil fuels.
This will save us in the long term.
We think that global warming potentially poses an existential threat to humanity.
If we believe that extinction is a bad thing, we must act now to subsidize renewable energies, particularly solar energy.
We would also say that in the short term, states are harmed, states like tuvalu have gone underwater, refugees come from states and small fishing villages that have been flooded due to global warming, and this is a harm that we're seeing in the short run.
The short run isn't an amalgamation of long runs and the individual action is a dis-amalgamation of large collective action.
What we mean by this is as we subsidize individual action against global warming, as a whole, we will fight it into the long and short term, saving huge numbers of lives and causing considerably less violence than the alternative.
My second argument is about environmental harms.
We see huge amounts of smog being produced by oil.
We see that as forests are destroyed for coal, we see a destruction of areas.
We see landslides and huge loss in habitats.
We see that power producers largely destroy local industry and harm the health of individuals who are nearby.
Environmental harms do does not necessarily discuss the harms of global warming but discusses why our environment is essential and the cleanliness of our environment is essential in a good quality of life.
We think that solar panels prose pose a potential benefit as it will allow us to decrease our reliance on fossil fuels which cause these kind of environmental harms.
My third argument is about cheaper energy.
Solar energy's incredibly cheap.
It's incredibly easy to fund incredibly large projects, using solar energy as the way that you produce the energy and using that costs you save through solar energy as a way to pay for the project.
As such, we're going to see more innovation, decreased costs, generally just a better world for all in which people pay less money for better goods if we introduce solar energy.
As such, we should further exploit solar energy."
