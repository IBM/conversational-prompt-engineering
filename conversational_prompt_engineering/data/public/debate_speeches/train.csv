"The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish the olympic games.
Two main areas of clash, the first on the way in which it devastates poorer country.
Recognize that bids for the olympic games traditionally go to developing countries because big western liberal democracies know that the financial burden is usually too big to bear or given that they're like the few who might actually have the resources to effect this change they oftentimes simply don't feel like it because of all the effort it takes or like political rile up that it causes.
So oftentimes, these more developing countries instead of those who can actually afford it take up the burden because they think it'll look good dash be an economic impetus whereas in reality they get stuck putting millions of dollars into infrastructure that no one ever uses again.
Like they're building a massive stadium and all of the associated housing for an event that literally will happen once in that country it like once in a century for a given country.
We saw this incredibly dramatically in the brazilian olympics where eventhough meanwhile there were like very real citizens of brazil starving and in need of actual attention, instead millions and millions of state funded dollars and like citizen funded dollars were going into building a stadium that they don't even have a sports team big enough to like use or another sport event that would ever use.
So, the problem here is that there isn't actually any long term economic solvency because it usually costs more than you'll earn from it and because the costs are so localized areas and regions that no one ever wants to go to.
It's also a problem because these stadiums are often built in poor areas given that they need to be next to an airport in the city center and but like this country but these nations can't build these in these stadiums and richer areas because there's too much political capital there that doesn't want it to occur.
So the only group of people that cannot control where the stadiums go tend to be the poor and so what happens is that because they don't have to ask for the consent of these people, these nations will build the stadiums on top of other people's homes and prevent them and push them out of these areas and out of these regions leaving them in even worse off situations than they had been before.
They also often pollute the area.
Like recognize when china hosted the olympics not too long ago, they had such a bad rating for their air after so many particles of different building materials were released into it that they killed thousands of people whose deaths were directly attributed to the pollution caused by the building and the tearing down of different buildings for the olympics.
Our second area of clash is how it causes political turmoil.
First it forces a lot of countries in a lot of leadership of countries into a small area which oftentimes creates like massive targets for these people, like recognize that individual countries send athletes who they tend to value a significant amount but also tend to send people like their presidents or people who are significant in the leadership to these events which means it creates a really large target for things like terrorist attacks as we saw in the nineteen seventy two munich massacre when palestinian terrorists killed off the israeli olympic team.
This both is like very that this creates a much larger harm than any other terrorist attack, because it makes a target of like an area that is supposed to be a safe space but also has the potential to give rise to a lot larger political tensions.
We saw this further when russia was hosting the sochi olympics when there was a lot of public disapproval due to the accommodations that actually heightened tensions between other countries and russia and we also saw this with the world war two olympics that were hosted in germany when they are fraught with racial tensions and like hitler basically showing off the fact that he hated all black people and jews.
We also think it promotes a really problematic form of nationalism in which it pits countries against each other athletically in addition to whatever else was going on at the same time which furthers any pre existing discontent and prevents collaboration in the future.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"Casinos should be banned.
So we are going to argue that government should not permit the construction of new casinos and should gradually phase out old ones.
So these should be casinos in places like las vegas or macau, that would be shut down over time and new ones, like the one being built near boston right now, would not be allowed to open in the first place.
Three arguments for our side: the first is that casinos' business model is coercive.
Basically in order to get people to come in and play their games casinos have to mislead people about the odds of winning.
If everyone knew that ultimately you will always lose money by playing at a casino, then many fewer people would participate.
But instead they choose to portray it such that games like roulette games of chance, where anyone can win, although actually this isn't really true.
We think that ultimately the government needs to step in because you shouldn't be able to uphold contracts between people when one side is coercing or misleading the other.
In other words, when you go to a casino and buy chips, you're entering into an agreement with them but you're doing so on faulty premises, namely the idea that you can win money by playing the games in the casino.
In fact, this isn't really true because their business model is to fleece people.
At that point we think that governments need to intervene, not allow these contracts to be formed, because one side has such an imbalance of power and information over at the other side.
We see that states do this all the time, such as by preventing children from entering into contracts because they walk decision making ability.
The people going to casinos similarly lack access to the information to make good decisions.
Our second argument is that casinos are bad for the communities which host them.
This is a huge debate anytime they want to build a new casino somewhere.
Ultimately we see that while it is true that casinos bring in tourism money, they don't spread that money around to the community.
Generally speaking, when people go to a casino, they stay at a casino hotel, they eat at the casino restaurant and they spend money gambling in the casino.
They don't go around to local landmarks and things like that because in general people travel there with things like all in one vacation plans etcetera, or they go to an area for the purpose of going to this casino.
What that means is that casinos consume a large amount of resources from the community.
Things like obviously utilities, but also taking people who work there for relatively low wages, who aren't doing productive work, because what do you get out of a casino?
But give relatively little back to the community around them.
Small businesses in the community don't really benefit from having these casinos in place.
What's more, it's likely that they bring in lots of unsavory elements.
Groups like organized crime often control casinos even when they're operated in a legal fashion.
What's more, they also encourage things like prostitution, because people expect to have access to that at casinos, and this then brings crime into the community which was absent before.
We can see that places like las vegas are very seedy and not somewhere that many people would want to live.
So ultimately we tell you that casinos are harmful for their communities and that this is a good reason to ban them, because they're bad for the people who have to live around them.
Our third argument is that the alternative world is one with much less gambling and that this is probably a better world.
Gambling is fundamentally very addictive and bad for people.
Many people experience the same kind of reaction to gambling that you or I might to cigarettes.
They feel it's very addictive.
So these people cannot make a rational decision about whether or not they want to continue gambling and things like that.
But people would be very unlikely to start gambling if there were no legal venue to do so.
Relatively few people gamble illegally.
So we tell you that in a world without casinos many fewer people would develop gambling addictions.
We think that this would obviously be good for those people and for society as a whole.
The other side might try to argue that illegal casinos will open up but we just don't see that this is the case in places like new york city where gambling is illegal right now.
So for all of these reasons casinos should be banned.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should further exploit nuclear power.
We being global governments across the world and exploiting meaning heavy investment into nuclear research and power and the building of power plants.
Two main areas of clash, the first on general prose of nuclear power.
We tell you, first, it is infinitely cheaper than any of our alternatives.
Recognize that going from oil that needs to be dug up requires expensive rigs, gas that needs the same kind of investment as oil and can only be provide by certain governments that control the price, even to things like wind where large turbines need to be built and controlled, all of these things are infinitely cheaper with something like nuclear power.
Where once you have the initial plant built all you need is materials that can be produced within labs for relatively low prices.
Especially as more groups of people provide more research and these corporations can compete with each other.
More than this we tell you that nuclear power plants are infinitely renewable.
You don't have to wait millions of years for plant matter to compact, you don't even have to wait for the corn to grow out, as is the way for things like bio-fuels.
But we also say that it's not as environmentally damaging as any of these alternatives that often create harmful by products that keep up the that damage the environment and make it more difficult to breathe.
We also tell you that the main argument against nuclear power plants is just false.
People say that it's so dangerous and chernobyl happened.
The problem with this is that chernobyl happened is a one percent chance risk a hundred years ago at a time where it was first technology that was much less developed but also in a time where these kind of safety regulations wasn't warrant as employed.
We tell you that learning from chernobyl allows us to create nuclear power plants that are almost impossible to fail.
That allow us to build out of materials that prevent exposure to nuclear fallout, that allow us to put in safety buttons that shut down the plant at the moment that there seems to be a problem.
We think that this kind of risk is immensely outweighed in so far the one percent chance of this nuclear power plant failing is much less than the fact that it can supply millions of people with energy and that one country can be powered by one large reactor.
But more than this we think that nuclear reactors generate important jobs and research.
We think it's good for our economy to invest in something like nuclear energy especially since oil and gas run out and get more expensive by the day that they run out.
We think at the point that you can invest in something that is renewable and invest in your own corporations to develop that this is necessarily positive for economies.
But we also think it's good for collaboration insofar as governments can collaborate with each others each other and research centers can move across nations in order to work on better technology.
Our second main area of clash has to do with why we don't have a choice.
We tell you there's not enough oil and gas, that bio-fuels are also not as easily renewable and take up more energy, and that things like wind energy and sun energy require for the wind and the sun to be present in order to use them.
We tell you that unlike them, nuclear power applies across the globe equally.
Regardless of whether you are in norway, where the sun never shines, or in south africa where the wind is very low.
We think that it's important to note that nuclear energy uniquely provides a way for which all governments, all areas across the globe can be powered.
But more than this, we tell you that eventually those developing countries will want to be fully developed.
The main reason that we still have gas in the status quo is because countries in africa and countries in east asia don't use as much power because they are not as developed as current first world countries.
We tell you the moment that these countries fully develop, provide power to all of their citizens, and invest in things like wifi that reaches across the globe, we lose out on the fact that they don't use as much power and the world power and the world's power consumption goes up massively.
We tell you we need to be prepared for this moment and the only way to do so is by investing in something like nuclear power that actually allows countries to develop fully without fear of harming everyone around them.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should ban sales of violent video games to minors.
Two independent points, but first the model.
So when we talk about violent video games we would define that as games that depict acts of violence.
And violence generally would be just sort of like enacting or like inflicting suffering upon another you know imaginary individual.
So certainly games that involve like large amounts of like gun violence is something that we would categorize this also games that glorify sexual violence like GTA like we're willing to cast a wide net with this.
But like anything that makes all of central point of its game play the players willingness to enact suffering upon another.
Particularly games that are willing to depict this without any sort of remorse from the player's character are things we would be willing to ban for sales to minors.
So really two independent points here.
The first being that it normalizes violence amongst the players.
So kids are pretty impressionable.
That generally speaking, this is something we realized with like all media that pertains to childrens consumption, kids really, really eagerly consume large amounts of media and it shapes their world view.
This is largely a product of the fact that when they are young they don't have an established world view at that point.
So their world view has to be based upon some sort of input that they receive at that early age.
And with less experiences under their wings, the individual bits and pieces that they get from the large amounts of media they consume are quite capable of shaping that world view.
This is especially true when that media has repetitive themes, like violence without recourse.
This is a problem for a couple reasons.
The first is that it reinforces adversarial social attitudes.
And what we mean by this is the notion that conflicts in your life are something that aren't solved by like diplomacy or just like talking things out, but rather with acts of violence that protagonists in these games, who have been wronged for some reason or another, respond with acts of mass violence and killing or at the most generous interpretation with at least like a lot of like punching and things like that.
While this makes for good game play, it doesn't shape adolescents perceptions of the world in a positive way.
It gives them the impression that the world when something bad happens to you there is someone that must be blamed, that there is something you can do that someone you can lash out at, and that will resolve the issue.
We think that, largely speaking, this is a big contributor to the unwillingness of most people in modern society to have these sorts of discussions and rather to be extremely willing to just place blame on other people.
But secondly, we think it just leads to people being violent.
That is that when you normalize violence to children, they are more willing to engage in violence because it is something that is glorified.
Our second independent point is that parents aren't a meaningful barrier to this type of erosion and as such the government has to intervene.
I think there's three reasons for this.
The first is just that kids are kinda sneaky.
That generally speaking, kids have ways of getting money.
They have allowances, they have jobs, and they can buy these games without their parents knowing.
So we don't think having parents keeping a watchful eye on kids is always like a meaningful barrier, right?
This is why like tobacco and cigarettes and things like that are illegal to children largely, because we can't expect parents to be like the end all be all of enforcing that norm.
Second, often parents don't know if an individual video game is too violent until they already have seen their kid playing it.
Like parents don't have the capacity to research every single video game that's out there, and as a result they can wind up buying their kids something they ask for and not know it's too violent until their kid is already played it frequently.
And thirdly, sometimes parents are just negligent.
Like sometimes parents just have like incorrect ideas and I think if you buy the arguments I've made today, there are always going to be parents that obviously disagree with me and at this point it's necessary to have some level of government intervention.
Proud to propose."
"We should ban the sale of violent video games to minors.
So, what this would look like in reality is that, there would be age checks that ensure that, individuals, who are below a certain age, cannot buy video games, there already rating system, so we would say any video game that has intense violence would receive an m rating, and that people below the age of eighteen will not be able to buy these things, you would also be fined, or possibly punish to imprisoned for a short period of time, if you were to then give these video games to minors, so if you're a parent, and you give this video game to your child, you could face financial, or other types of repercussions.
Okay, so, two main arguments: the first is that youth is is immensely impressionable, and we need to prevent this impression from being attached to them, and the second is that youth are not full agents, and therefore it is fair to restrict them, when it gives them a different benefit.
Okay, so firstly on why youth is impressionable.
We think that, even though these violent video games are unlikely to lead to these types lead to these people like actually creating and committing crimes in the future.
What we think these things do is desensitize youth to the violence that exists around them.
And especially at a point, in which these people are very young, if they already become desensitized to these things, while they're young, we think they're unlikely to try and respond to them passionately and politically in the future.
And this is crucial, because we think that, if you don't have a politically active group, if you don't have a group of young people that see violence, and see the problems in the world, as something that need to be solved, as something that isn't normal and okay, that, what would likely happen is that, these people are less likely to be politically active, and motivated to change these things in the future.
We think, early in collocation, at such a young age, below eighteen, while eighteen may be an arbitrary line, we think that allowing people to have these things, at such an early age, is almost certainly going to result in long term ramifications, and it's possible that people, who see this type of violence, become so desensitized that they commit those crimes in the future.
Even if this is a marginal chance of happening, we think that these crimes can often be so heinous, murder, and other types of assault, that people learn from violent video games that normal like shootings and things like this, we think that, you shouldn't take these risks, especially because there's no positive benefit gained from allowing these people to have access to these video games, and as I'll explain in a moment, they're not full agents, and therefore restricting their rights is not a moral harm.
So, they're not full agents for a few reasons, which are crucial.
The first is that, simply legally, they're not recognized as full adults.
Under the law, which is the legal and moral system that states act under, these people are not fully autonomous individuals, and we recognize that by not allowing them to do things, like drink, vote, and otherwise interact with society in the same way that adults are able to.
We think under this legal system, given that there are certain risks that come from desensitizing these individuals, we think that, it is simply in line, with the logic of our legal system, to restrict them from being able to do this.
Furthermore, it's clear that individuals become more autonomous, and more able to make choices with age.
The further they've been socialized, the more they've been able to gain independence, in slow steps, from the time that they're born, to the time they leave their parent's house, are able to otherwise be independent at age eighteen.
We think that, there are significant social steps that these individuals go through, in which they gain autonomy, and they gain agency.
We don't think that people are simply born with these capabilities, but rather learn these capabilities through their socialization.
Given that these individual simply haven't been exposed to the world, in a way in which they can differentiate between the violence that exists in these video games, and the type of violence that's occurring, and how these things are distinct from the real world, we think that these individuals should not be exposed to these types of things.
So and finally, we think that the state has an obligation to correct for bad parents.
We think that, parents are not innately gifted with the ability to parent, and that sometimes they raise their children in improper ways.
Given that these types of video games are likely to desensitize their children, which, as I've already explained, is a crucial harm moving forward, we think that it's clear that, the state has an obligation to act, in this instance, in line with the legal code that already exists, and we should ban the sale of violent video games to minors."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of today's motion, that we should ban casinos.
I think the model here is pretty intuitive, we just ban places where people gamble money, you know, we can do a staff task for this sort of thing, to figure out what exactly constitutes gambling, we would also be comfortable banning things like online gambling, and like non site gambling as well, we think this is well within the spirit of the motion.
So, two independent points under this, first that gambling addiction is a serious problem, and by banning the venues at which gambling can occur, we can meaningfully mitigate the scope of this issue, and secondly, the economic problems that are created by casinos, particularly within the local areas that they are built.
So first, on addiction: we would say that the existence of casinos, or any location where gambling can occur in a regulated fashion, facilitates gambling addictions.
This is I think pretty intuitive why gambling addictions are bad, generally being addicted to anything is bad, insofar as it definitionally forces the victim to engage in irrational and unhealthy behavior.
But gambling addiction particularly is something, that causes larger financial dreams on the individual, has a large externalities on their families or loved ones.
We think this is something that causes a lot of suffering to people, and necessarily it would be good to mitigate the extent of that.
So, casinos facilitate this, in the sense that you have to actually go somewhere to gamble, that you have to gamble with something, but casinos particularly are more pernicious than just, like, individual like day to day interactions, or small gambles, because the serial nature of a casino, that is that you could blow like thousands of dollars in a very short amount of time, makes it very easy for the worst cases of gambling addiction to blossom into something, that is the worst possible iteration of a gambling addiction.
So, we would say then, that basically as a spike to arguments about what, like, black markets are worse, that this is a special instance, in which black markets are unlikely going to be worse than the status quo, a, because the status quo is already pretty awful, but secondly, because the black market for gambling is so tiny, because it's very very difficult to organize like a large operation, where people have to engage in this illegal activity for hours at a time.
So, realistically the comparative is just so much smaller in scope, that that the lack of regulation probably isn't going to make up, for just how much smaller the industry would be in an illegal market.
The second independent point we have is how casinos are economically harmful, particularly for their communities.
We would say this plays out in four ways, first is that the tourism, that people often cite as a benefit of casinos, is zero sum.
It detracts from the other tourist attractions people will be spending their time out of the neighboring areas, and because casinos are generally these all inclusive things, were you like never have to leave the facility, there's very little were recirculation of money into the local area.
So, if someone were to go to see like, I don't know, the woods, or something, and you're like upstate new york area, where you're considering buying a casino, they might, you know, favor local restaurants or things like that.
They won't do that if it's a casino though.
Secondly, the proceeds from casinos generally go outside of the area where they're built, to wealthy investors, stake holders, that sort of thing.
Third, gambling is just an economically inefficient thing, that like the actual model of how a casino works is that you spend a lot more money than you get back.
So, that money is drained from the economy, exacerbates income inequality, by moving that money out of the poor areas, that generally are forced to consider building casinos in the first place, and puts it into the pocket of generally people in urban areas, that don't have these things.
Fourth is that externalities like traffic, that are generated by the casino, make the region less attractive to non gamblers, and then detract from the other forms of tourism they would generally get, because people don't want to have to deal with the issues created by the presence of the casino.
So, while on paper it looks like: oh, this casino is going to like bring a lot of people into the area, most reasonably, they're a, not going to benefit the local economy very well, b, mostly going to benefit people that already have lots of money, and c, are going to actively harm the other things, that are keeping your economy on track in the first place.
For all these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should abolish the olympic games.
So, for the purpose of the model, we think this is very simple.
We would just say that every four years, every two years, because there's a winter and a summer games, we would no longer host the olympics.
We wouldn't allow any country to host these things.
We would say that if it were to happen, countries should boycott it.
We simply think the olympic games should come to an end.
Okay.
A few reasons why we think the olympic games need to be abolished.
The first is that the olympic games are incredibly bad for the countries that host them.
So, people may have an understanding of the olympics as a way to increase tourism to a region, a way to increase economic inflow to a region, a way to get people or to get countries on the map, put cities on the map, and create your create a stage that you can put yourself on a higher global standing, but in reality the olympics do very little for the countries that host them.
For example, when brazil hosted the olympics most recently, they were first suffering from an immense economic downturn that only allowed there to be even more pressure placed on them to put infrastructure in place to build for the olympics that counteracted all the things that the state needed to do in order to support its people, in order to serve its national interests.
So these things often come at massively inopportune times for the countries and again, there's very little way to plan for the time when you're going to face an economic downturn.
But even when you're not in that situation, whenever you host the olympic games, you're forced to construct a massive amount of infrastructure.
Almost no country can support the olympic games without constructing many more stadiums, housing housing facilities for the for the people that compete in the games, for coaches and things like this.
It takes an immense amount of infrastructure spending, an immense amount of building and construction, in order to put these games together.
But the problem is these this type of infrastructure does very little to serve the country moving forward.
The country simply doesn't need seventeen different soccer stadiums for any other sporting event but the olympics and once these stadiums are created, they simply lay there and rot and waste.
It's a massively inefficient way of spending your money.
And also, economic inflow that goes in the country is oftentimes outweighed by this infrastructure creation, so it doesn't even allow there's not even a short-term net gain of constructing this infrastructure, especially when revenue needs to be shared with the IOC and different partners that exist within the olympics.
There's very little left over for the state itself to gain in revenue.
So, we think that simply the olympic games are bad for the host countries.
We also think that the olympic games, as they stand, allow you to glorify powerful countries and powerful states at the expense of less powerful ones.
Recognize that the games themselves are incredibly unequal.
There are developed states that that are capable of pouring millions of dollars into supporting programs, into training programs, into the athletic programs versus the mass majority of countries that simply don't have either the population size or the money at their disposal to create winning olympic teams.
And so what you end up seeing in the olympic standings, year after year, is that powerful nations are able to dominate over less powerful nations.
We think that this doesn't foster any type of system of cooperation but only resentment towards the more powerful countries.
And we think that in a increasingly globalized world, it's problematic that every four or every two years, we create this immense amount of competition between states when we should be trying to foster cooperation.
People sometimes say that the olympics are a way of bringing the global community together, but it's odd that we do this in such a way in which it ultimately turns into a competition between the states, where the powerful states, the ingrained states, always end up on top.
We think that this is a bad signaling mechanism and is a bad job of fostering cooperation.
We also think that given that there are massive infrastructure and spending outlays in order to host the olympics, we think that these countries, especially the less developed countries that oftentimes end up hosting the olympics, we think that it would just be much preferable for these states to put money into their into their nations, into their nation building, into helping their populace, rather than building stadiums that are going to be used on a global stage for two weeks and ultimately abandoned and turned into bus parking lots.
For those reasons, we should abolish the olympic games."
"The free market brings more good than harm.
We think that in order to have this debate, we need to set aside what we think the free market uniquely brings to an economy, as opposed to different kinds of economic structure such as communism, state-run economic systems, highly rigid and regulated market economies and other things like that.
So what do we think that's a free market uniquely brings.
Firstly, we think the free market uniquely provides an opportunity for competition.
Whether it's an economic system like communism in which there isn't a competition for resources because there is combined ownership of these resources, or if it's a system like state-run capitalism in which the state controls these resources, and the state dictates how businesses are going to behave.
Free markets allow for the interaction between businesses and free persons in a market, in which competition results in you getting more and you being better off.
We also think it provides a financial incentive to be efficient and to be innovative.
We think that these are the ways in which people thrive in free market economies, is by creating products in the cheapest way possible, that do the most to advance people into the most, to set themselves aside from what already exists.
So, what do we think are three benefits that make the free market uniquely good and preferable to other systems.
Firstly, we think that the free market creates immense amounts of material gains.
The need to innovate is essential to getting these types of financial these types of financial gains, and it's no wonder why in a massive free market economy, like the united states, innovation is driven in this nation and other free nations like in europe.
We think that this is the case because there's a business incentive to be innovative, there's a business incentive to come up with new ideas and to come up with new products.
We also think that when you have things like government subsidies, this is less likely to happen, because you have less of a drive to achieve these things because you're more financially secure.
We think a world without free market has immense amounts of material loss that have real tangible harms to people.
Less access to good medicine, less access to entertainment that is able to bring together cultures and express personal beliefs, less ability to communicate with each other, which is a crucial ability to share ideas and become the solutions about common problems, and things as simple as housing that allow for people to be comfortable on a daily life, we don't think any of these things are as preferable as a world in which the free market had never existed.
Secondly, the free market allows for consumer protection.
An open market means multiple suppliers, and what this means is that consumers are able to choose which supplier they are going to go towards.
We think that while government regulations can do some good in ensuring that consumers are protected, we think that the government and government run enterprises, in order to cut costs, has incentives not to protect consumers.
So when a market in which you can go to any different person you would like to to attain similar quality goods, we think that this is a world in which there is an incentive for people to provide high quality goods, and to provide goods in which consumers aren't going to be harmed because firstly, you want to maintain your consumer base by not harming those people, but more importantly, you don't want them to shift to other suppliers.
Because everyone has this incentive, it means people are more likely to provide quality products.
So we think that not only do you get material gains and innovative material gains, you also get comfort and safety in the market.
And finally, free labor.
The free market economy allows for people to determine their own ends in which markets and which jobs they want to participate in, and they get to choose how they are going to pursue their economic productivity.
When people aren't directed by outside forces, we think that they're allowed to choose careers that are on balance more fulfilling than they otherwise would have been if they had been dictated towards those people or dictated to them.
Because people are allowed to specialize in fields that they already have passions for and interests in, because people can shift their labor market, go back to school, get new education and change careers in a free market system, and in which people can always improve upon themselves in order to achieve better gains, in order to make themselves more competitive in the labor market, people are more able to have control over their destiny.
And we think because of this and because the material and protection in gains that people gained, the free market brought and brings more good than harm."
"We should absolutely further exploit nuclear power because it is cheaper and more more efficient than a lot of alternatives, and because it's also better for the environment and cleaner than a lot of the alternatives.
So let's start by talking about why it's cheaper more effective.
The sad reality is that while things like solar energy wind energy in hydroelectric energy are great non renewable resources, they're also by and large not very efficient and very expensive compared to our actual need.
And that's a problem because while those are viable long term strategies, the reality is that things like climate change and pollution and all that are big problems, and they're big problems right now, that we need to solve right now.
And they aren't just things that we can wait a decade or so until technology develops and investments develop in green technology and things like that.
So, as long as that's the case we need to look at alternatives and I think that nuclear energy is an incredibly viable alternative a great alternative in fact.
A lot of countries like france predominately get their energy from nuclear power.
It's mostly places like america which is one of the biggest the biggest polluter in all of history, that is reliant on sources of energy like coal and gas and things like that.
So why are these forms of , so obviously coal and gas are bad in that like their big polluters things like that.
The big appeal for them is that they're cheap compared to green technologies.
However, nuclear energy is incredibly efficient in the way that it's used and it's oftentimes a whole lot cheaper, because you don't really need all that much uranium.
It's not like weapons grade uranium.
Like you don't really need to enrich it to pass certain levels and things like that all that much.
You don't need to get as much like advanced technologies and things like that.
In a lot of ways we've been using nuclear power for a long time, it's pretty like well developed, works pretty well, it's efficient, checks up all the boxes for a workable source of of our energy.
And this important because they also think that it's clean and good for the environment.
So there's some people who are like: "" wow, wait.
But what about the possibility of a nuclear meltdown and radioactive waste and things like that?
That sounds pretty bad for the environment. ""
So, true, those things may not be great but first and foremost those things are pretty rare.
There's only a handful of cases where you actually see nuclear power plants going to melt down, and these are usually the results of like very rare natural disasters.
So things like a tsunami in case of fukushima or things like that.
But oftentimes it's not the result of like the technology itself being bad, it's a result of natural disasters, which is a problem because you can just as easily see these accidents are just as common with things like oil and natural gas.
You see explosions with this kinds of things all the time, you can see like oil spills literally happen all the time.
There so much oil in the oceans, it's ridiculous and it's obviously horrible for wildlife and these things are oftentimes more widespread.
It's maybe just not as like eye popping as nuclear meltdowns in most cases, so I think that's a big thing there.
But it's also important because the next thing is also on the issue waste and things like that.
So nuclear waste is like probably a whole lot better than pollution and things like that, in standard things like coal and coal mining or injecting chemicals into the ground for something like fracking for oil or any of these kinds of things.
The bigger reason for that is like it's a pretty big world and it's pretty easy to secure nuclear waste in like individual facilities and places like that, in incredibly secure locations.
So like you can like store it like deep underground or like in mountains and things like that, where there's almost no risk of it actually going anywhere.
And like sure it's going to build up forever, it's essentially a nuclear landfill which isn't great, but ultimately these things are a whole lot better than the status quo, which is most of these things instead pollution just gets pumped into the air that we breathe, which is bad.
So yes, further exploit nuclear power."
"The free market should be protected.
So in this debate we're not going to talk about the specific regulations about how the free market's going to be protected.
We're just going to say that generally, a just state should provide a free market and a very open market that allows people to behave in a capitalist system.
We're going to have robust regulations that protect that market, etcetera.
So firstly, we would say that a free state should, based on its own principles, have a free market.
So what does this mean?
A just state is one that maximizes the freedom of its citizens.
The reason for this is that it's actually impossible to get the consent of one's citizens, or at least the totality of your citizens to consent, and the reason that people would consent to the state is because without one there's no protection of freedom or any sort of protection for autonomy and so those things, we think, must be maximized by a just state in order for that state to be just.
If a state creates laws trying to maximize any other thing then people would not have consented to that state, or many people would not have consented to that state making it an unjust state.
We think a just state naturally, based on those ideas of freedom and autonomy, would give rise to a free market.
You need some sort of economic system in any state that's going to exist and a free market allows for people to freely enter into contracts into one with one another maximizing their autonomy in that way, choose the occupation that they want to pursue, which is the free choice of how they want to spend a large amount of the time in their day, spend money on goods and services that they see fit without the government deciding for them what they need to purchase or what's best for them, and create businesses around the product and around the product and model individual desires within one's own businesses which we think gives you maximal freedom interacting in the economic sphere.
We think that being able to express freedom within the marketplace is huge.
The economic realm is one in which people spend a huge portion of their lives and accrue goods for their own well being.
We think a just state must uphold free market structures in order to allow the maximal amount of freedom and autonomy within this huge sphere of life.
Secondly we'd say that you get the best allocation of resources under a free market model.
A few reasons for this: free markets naturally allocate jobs and resources in the most fair way.
So let's talk about labor allocation: we think that firstly, when you have a free market labor is likely to migrate in order to fill available positions.
This mobility ensures that you've an efficient allocation of labor throughout the entire labor force.
This is why more people congregate around cities because those jobs, the best jobs and the most amount of jobs are in those cities.
We think that jobs compete with one another to offer competitive wages that people are willing to work for when you have a free market that allows businesses to rise up and compete with one another.
Conversely, labor can lead to with one another to acquire skills that make them valuable in the job market.
Every person that's an individual laborer is competing with everyone else to try and get the best job available and the way you do this is by accruing the most skill.
The result of this is the most efficient worker job pairing which yields the highest output in productivity that is possible from any individual labor source.
Finally, about prices of goods and services.
We think that prices in a free market will only go as high as the market can bear.
Meaning, if people are unwilling to pay a price for a good it's simply not going to sell and prices will have to go down.
We think that excessive luxury goods are unlikely because of low demand and a high demand for essentials means that many businesses open to fill a hole in the market if those essentials are not being provided and to produce those goods.
Finally we think that innovation is massively encouraged because innovation doesn't only provide you with a new opportunity for revenue, it opens an entirely new market that wasn't there before.
Something that allows you to corner a market early on and gain immense amounts of revenue compared to trying to enter an existing market.
All these things allocate resources in a way that's not only efficient but also does so in a way that maximizes autonomy and freedom of all actors involved.
For these reasons the free market should be protected."
