"The motion for today's debate is that we should further exploit hydroelectric dams.
We think that the most important thing to keep in mind within this debate is that we want to promote renewable energy given that the current situation is untenable.
There are facts in the world such as that in two hundred years from now we will have polluted if we continue with the energy that we are using we will have polluted the world to a point of habitability.
More than this the the kinds of casualties that will occur along the way will be both economically and and like personally damaging to humans.
So two main areas of clash: the first on why global warming is bad.
Recognize that global warming takes away our coastlines, destroys entire towns and homes, causes mass relocation and loss of jobs, destroys nature and species that could be helpful to humans in the future but we will never know because the jungles are dying off.
As such it is also economically awful when you are losing large amounts of land because of the because of weather changes and monsoons when you are having to relocate people in large numbers this becomes a strain not only on the individual economically but also on the government.
Large amounts of money have to get funneled into relief supports and especially in more tropical nations global warming changes the way that your farming can grow and you can no longer produce food in a way that is first, manageable to your people, but second, sellable to a point where you maintain your economy.
What this means is that in order to prevent these changes from occurring, the first step to solving it is to switching to more renewable and sustainable energy.
We think that hydroelectric dams are an incredibly good example of this.
We think that not only is it in it is incredibly cheap and very renewable, but that it has shown that it can power large amounts of space at once.
The entire state of washington in the united states currently is powered by a hydroelectric dam.
At the point that it is massively under used we think that it ought be exploited in order to not end up in a world that is uninhabitable due to too much smog and and not enough food.
Our secondary of clash has to do with why hydroelectric dams are especially under used.
Unlike unlike solar energy that goes away when the sun sets or wind energy that stops coming in as much when the wind slows down, water never stops flowing.
What this means is that it is the only truly consistent form of renewable energy because regardless of the weather and regardless of the time of day the water will always flow through the dam and create electricity.
We think that it's a problem that currently humans have a bad association with dams because of old technology.
But recognize that this has changed.
Now we have things like fish ladders that allow fish to travel across hydroelectric dams even if even if like the dam exists across the entire river so you're not actually damaging the environment that way and we also don't need to completely dam the river either we just need it to be able to flow across the dam so you don't get large amounts of rivers completely cut off and you don't damage the environment that we either.
More than this we tell you the technology is going to get even better if we invest in it more.
If we show that there is a demand for this kind of energy and that consumers want it corporations will do what is profitable.
They will turn away from less green energy and move towards hydroelectric dams and bettering that technology so that power output is larger.
We think moreover though that water and rivers is easily available in nations that otherwise might be difficult for them to get something else.
In areas of africa, where you have power, where you have things like the the like the nile you can dam up parts of the nile for hydroelectric dams and power all of the villages surrounding that area.
In areas this is like similarly true regardless of climate.
So even if you go somewhere where it is much colder such as antarctica, you would still be able to find a similar alternative.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"We should limit birth control.
What we mean by this is that we're not actually limiting something like condoms.
I think we're talking entirely about hormonal birth control, IE, the pill, the nuvaring, the shot, depo-provera, so on so forth.
And by limit, we would mean that anyone under the age of eighteen would require a doctor visit before they would be prescribed the pill or the ring or any other hormonal birth control that they prefer.
So, in the status quo, there are oftentimes online doctors or like telephone calls or over-the-counter versions of the pill, or like parents can pick them up for their children, we don't want any of that.
We want there to be like a distinct "" I am under eighteen years old.
I want to use this thing, "" but we think that condoms would still be available easily over-the-counter.
We're not changing that.
Three main areas of clash: first, on my hormones are dangerous to young bodies.
Recognize that the side effects that we often don't talk to are talk about are actually very, very large, such as a lot of women who take the pill suffer from depression as a direct result of it.
And this is something that often goes under-researched because the scientific industry is incredibly sexist, but we do like these things do happen and can be very bad.
This is in addition to occasionally hormonal treatments can do things like cause cancers or different kinds of tumors, and we think the problem in the status quo is that we have this lackadaisy attitude where we pretend that these are fake problems that don't really affect many people, without recognizing that these are very real risks that individuals should have the ability to consult consent to first.
We think this is especially bad for younger children.
Because if I'm a thirty-year-old woman who has contextualized the rest of my life, and like has recognized that that's a tradeoff I am willing to make, like I really just want the ease of doing of just having the pill once a day or the ease of like sliding in the nuvaring once a month, then we think that that's a tradeoff that you, as an adult, can make.
But not only can the side effects be a lot worse for younger bodies because you are someone who is still developing, it's also just something you can't contextualize because you're not someone who has been exposed to very much depression.
You're not someone who has seen these kinds of impacts on other people or read as much about them by nature of the fact that you are younger.
We think that these are long-term impacts for birth birth control that is not particularly necessary given the existence of condoms and spermicide that are available over-the-counter and work perfectly well.
Our second area of clash is about promoting informed consent, because we think there's a problem in the status quo where individuals pretend that birth control isn't a big deal, and for a lot of people it isn't.
But we think it's important to recognize the potential for damage that it can do and make sure that individuals are informed of that.
And we think the easiest way to make sure that they are informed is making sure that they have to do something like talk to a professional about the thing they're about to put into their bodies before they actually start doing it on the daily.
In the status quo, people get the majority of their information off the internet or from their parents when it comes to this kind of birth control stuff.
And maybe that's okay, because we recognize that a lot of information is available on the internet, but we also think that children and young like younger people are uniquely bad at being thorough when it comes to these subjects.
So sitting down and talking to a professional about the way this might interact with your body, or your history, or if you're someone who's like prone to anxiety and depression, whether or not this is still something you ought do, or having knowledge of what an ectopic pregnancy might look like, all of these things are things you're less likely to find online that a doctor will mention you, and we think that promoting that education is very important.
Our third area of clash is about promoting proper use because we think that oftentimes personalized medicine is best, even if the general one can be used either like will function, IE, sure, you can give me a pill for birth control and it'll work, regardless of my weight, the majority of the time, but it's always going to be more effective if it is something that is personalized to my weight, to my habits, to my, like, sleep schedules, so on so forth.
And we think that that's something that a doctor can do for you, like, go over your specific situation and choose a type.
Proud to propose."
"We should end athletic scholarships.
So in this debate we're talking about the kinds of scholarships common at many division one schools in the united states where students get a full ride in exchange for playing sports at a very high level at oftentimes large wealthy universities.
We're not concerned with partial scholarships offered at smaller schools or were students actually have a choice about playing, we're really talking about those where students are forced to play in order to keep their scholarship.
So with that in mind we have two main points: the first is that this is abusive to the students who receive those scholarships.
As a bit of context, recognize that many of the students receiving these scholarships come from a low income background where they wouldn't normally have the opportunity to attend these universities.
So the other team might tell you it's good that they gain an opportunity, but we think that what's actually happening is that they're being coerced to accept the scholarships whether or not they're a good deal because this is seen as their only ticket out of perhaps a bad neighborhood or a ticket out of poverty.
At that point we don't think people are able to freely opt in or out of these scholarships.
So with that in mind, recognize that the students are being forced to work for free.
Although the other team might say they're being given a free university education, we don't normally let employers pay in kind in the developed world.
They can't give you tickets to spend at the factory store anymore in exchange for work.
Which is basically what it amounts to if you pay someone for their work by giving them some of your product for free.
They don't get any money, they're not allowed to make money off of their likeness and ultimately these universities are making millions of dollars as a result at the expense of these students.
And they can't quit.
If you stop playing football or basketball at one of these universities, then you lose your scholarship and you're completely out of luck.
We'd also like to point out that oftentimes these university athletic systems are used as a free training program by pro sports leagues.
The NBA and the NFL in the united states don't run training leagues.
Instead they recruit college athletes.
So what they do is let colleges train these students and pay for it and make millions of dollars off of them and then the NBA and the NFL get to make millions of dollars off of them without paying for their training.
And if they got hurt in college and aren't able to pay pro, well that means that the league saves that much more money and leave those students with none of the money that they would have made playing in pro leagues.
We think that's the trade off here, is that without these scholarships the pro sports leagues would have to pay to train these students and ultimately they would actually have some money and have some recourse and some opportunity if they got injured.
Our second point is that we think this is bad for the universities that offer the scholarships.
We think that primarily it is a poor use of funds.
The other team might say that a school like university of california berkeley has plenty of money and this doesn't mean anything to them.
But money is fungible.
So any money that a school like berkeley spends on athletics instead of on academics or research is money that's not helping other people.
This money could have been spent on medical research, or perhaps more likely, it could have been spent on scholarships for needy students.
We think that it would be much better to go and recruit athletically talented students from the same areas and same demographics that would normally get athletic scholarships and give the money to them since they're more likely to be able to fulfill the university's primary purpose, namely to provide education to citizens.
And lastly we think that you lose out on qualified students.
You're using a lot of your resources on a handful of basketball, football, baseball players by having these scholarships.
So other students aren't receiving the same resources and might choose to go to other universities.
We think a lot of people probably choose other schools over berkeley because they can't get access to facilities or things that they need and ultimately if the school provided for those students rather than spending a lot of money on athletic scholarships then maybe they would attract better students overall.
So for these reasons we should end athletic scholarships.
Thank you"
"The motion for today's debate is that we should raise the fuel tax.
What we mean by this is that we would raise the tax on any kind of natural gas, oil, anything used as a fuel either for vehicles or for homes.
Two main areas of clash, first on stopping global climate change.
Recognize that car transport emissions make up the vast majority of global emissions contributing to climate change.
The most important thing this is the most important thing to prevent because global climate change destroys peoples' homes through rising tides, kills crops and cattle, and facilitates the spread of diseases as to as temperature changes and diseases that could never have survived in certain climates become particularly hardy and particularly capable of infecting people in those regions.
The only way to cut down on emissions and so cut down on climate change is to stop using as much fuels.
And as costs rise, people will necessarily have to cut down naturally because they will just physically will not be able to afford the same amount of fuel that they had previously.
Recognize also that people overuse their cars and overuse the fuel unnecessarily because they are like comfortable in the prices and comfortable in being able to afford them.
We think things like when you're stuck in traffic and allowing your car to continue to idle, taking road trips when you don't need to, taking your car rather than public transport when we live in a city, all of these are culpable for emissions that never needed to happen.
They're careless emissions that people take because they can afford to suffer for them.
So we think that if you like made sure that people could not afford that they would cut down on all of that unnecessary emitting and that would be preferable.
But it's also on a wider scale.
Higher prices stimulate the free market to come up with an alternative and so we think that through a combination of individuals being forced to cut down and a combination of corporations being forced to look for an alternative you're going to end up with a world where emissions are considerably cut down.
I think it's also important to note that the world has clearly prioritized emissions in a large sense when it comes to climate change through the signing of things like the PCA where the major things that countries are measuring globally are how much that country is emitting.
This brings us to our second point of argumentation which is about encouraging energy innovation.
People don't change when they are comfortable.
People are okay with the current prices and with with the invention of fracking the supply is unlikely to decrease to the point where it would threaten either the lives of corporations or individuals' pocket books thus the price is unlikely to increase.
Moreover because there is a clear consumer base that is tied up in oil and gas, there is no incentive to have competition or creation of alternatives because any company that in the status quo says hey I'm going to go explore a different kind of energy doesn't see themselves as as like having the possibility of making enough money to justify the risks that they are taking of their company failing ie they see the fact that people are happy with what they have now and they're worried that they won't be able to get enough investors, won't be able to get enough people to buy their product once it is developed, and so they never do it.
With higher prices the consumer can't afford and so demands an alternative.
This means that corporations work a lot harder to get the alternative quickly and efficiently and it also means they get more private investors and political support.
This both cuts emissions and creates jobs and economic impetuses.
Look it's really comfortable for large governments to be tied up in large oil organizations that take them to lunches pay them a lot of money to keep them unregulated and so the only way where we would expect to make change on this political ladder is by causing the consumer who votes these politicians into office and buys gas and oil to feel the like to feel enough of a burn that they are willing to make a change and willing to call for a change.
This only happens on our side of the house.
Proud to propose."
"We should ban tattoos.
Now tattoos may seem like this harmful thing, sometimes cool way that people express themselves, maybe even a part of their culture but all of those things are just false that's all just false.
It's lies.
Tattoos are a menace and they need to be regulated because they are completely in violation of basic norms and decency and they certainly go against they certainly are a violation of public norms that we need to regulate most notably in terms of like religious consequences.
So let's start by talking about what's wrong with tattoos.
So I think it goes without saying that you have to ask the question why are human bodies the way in which they are?
Why don't human bodies look in some other kind of different way?
And there's a lot of scientific theories going around but I think that we can all agree that the most reasonable interpretation of why humans exist the way that they are is because that's the way in which god created us and that that and since god created us in such a way when you get a tattoo you're essentially altering altering the body that god gave you.
Essentially god gave you a gift with your life saying that like hey, this is your body and you should love it because you're beautiful and I made you this way because this is the way in which I think that you should be.
And by getting tattoos or physical body modifications you're essentially saying, no god, I think that my body should look this way.
And that's obviously very, very bad for a lot of reasons like first, because god's perfect and knows everything so god knows how your body should be, but second, you're also like defying god's will so that's another thing that's very bad so a lot of these are like very much grounded in like basic philosophy in a lot of cultures.
So like you look at judaism you can't be buried in a jewish cemetery if you get tattoos.
You probably can't get buried officially if you have ear piercings either or maybe that's changed who knows.
But be that as it may, tattoos, very bad, you're not supposed to be able to get those if you're jewish.
Why is that?
Well because god agrees with all the things that I've been talking about for the past two minutes and that it's a essentially a defilement of god's image.
So now that all of that has been mentioned, why is this important?
What is the link between god thinking that something is bad and government action and like a necessity of government regulation of some kind of thing?
Well it goes without saying that when god thinks that you're doing something wrong this isn't just some vague abstract bad that is only going to result in a punishment to you.
The punishment goes beyond your individual consequences so you're not just going to go to hell or fade away into nothingness if you sin or if you defile your body in a way in which is unbecoming to god.
What is going to happen is god is going to punish you.
And oftentimes when god punishes you, god punishes the people around you.
And when god punishes the people around you that's like a third party harm that you have to make sure that you're like regulating against.
So like, for example, when like god wanted to punish the sinners of like sodom and gomorrah god like sent in like the nice biblical flood that got rid of all of humanity except for noah and noah's ark.
So this is like very interesting because it's like reasonable to assume that like not literally every single person in sodom and gomorrah was a sinner.
Like I'm sure a good deal of them were and that like you had you had god had just had to purge like a good portion of them but but be that as it may, not everyone was necessarily bad place.
But the rest of them probably all got unfairly punished except for noah.
So for all those reasons it's very, very urgent that we ban tattoos.
They clearly do a whole lot of harm to society presumably donald trump was elected president because too many people have tattoos in america.
So for all those reasons ban them."
"We should abandon democracy and we should do so because people don't have a right to democracy and things would probably better without it.
So let's start by talking about what we would replace democracy with.
We would replace democracy with a one party state that one party would be liberal it would be probably socialist too and it would oppress and it would definitely oppress violently if necessary anyone who tried to restore the conservative order of capitalist elitists who run everything and racists and people like that none of them will be able to have power so if you're racist if you're stupid if you're some like greedy capitalist none of you get power.
We're going to have a one party state that's going to be filled with accepting open empathetic liberals who are going to be wonderfully understanding they're going to be intelligent and everything's going to be wonderful.
So let's first talk about why that's not really going to violate any important rights at all and then second why that's going to make everything in the entire world a whole lot better.
So let's start by talking about why you don't really have a right to democracy.
And I think this is already something that we implicitly implicitly accept although not to the greatest extent that we're defending here and here's why.
The idea of democracy is basically just that the people choose but we already put limits on that.
People can choose to like for example you can't choose to enslave another person, you don't get to choose to do certain kinds of things we put limits on various we put limits on democracy all the time and we do it for the purpose of empowering people to make sure people's rights are respected etcetera etcetera.
So here's the problem.
I think democracy is necessarily in conflict with a lot of people's rights.
So when you elect people like donald trump with democracy you're oppressing people who are latin american you're oppressing black people you're oppressing women when you put people like jeff sessions in power you're oppressing pretty much like like anyone else when you put roy when you elect someone like roy moore rather than having a one party state that wouldn't let roy moore run in alabama you make it so that like literal pedophiles can get elected because the people who are voting are stupid so all of those kinds of things necessarily come with tradeoffs.
When people get voted because of democracy people's rights are getting affected and people are actually hurt by this whether it's like women who get hurt by antiwoman politicians or immigrants who get hurt by antiimmigrant politicians muslims who get hurt by islamophoes etcetera etcetera.
So we we already accept a limited extent that democracy isn't unlimited we have courts for a reason.
Courts are inherently undemocratic in that they essentially can like unilaterally change the law in a lot of ways.
So we already accept this, but we just need to go farther with this and I think that that's an important thing.
So why would things be a lot better?
Well this is kind of the obvious part.
Whether it's like a trillion dollar tax cut for billionaires that is definitely not going to be on the table anymore or it's things like like a muslim ban or a transgender in a military ban like or like like a genocide in yemen we could there's there's like literally any bad thing in the world could probably be better off if you had more reasonable empathetic intelligent people in charge who aren't greedy asses and that's something that I think that we can replace.
So we would throw all of them out because a lot of them take advantage of democracy.
A lot of them lie to people like donald trump is a liar, a lot of them take advantage of propaganda networks allow them to take advantage of stereotypes or biases that people have, a lot of people are just stupid and shouldn't be able to vote in the first place because you don't because like your stupidity should make it so that really important policy decisions and rights violations are going to be worse off for everybody so I think that a lot of these things can really be remedied especially in a modern age where it's so easy for fake news to spread so you know what replace all of them only allow only allow a one party state to exist and don't let people mess everything up with bad choices.
So for all those reasons abandon democracy."
"We should abolish open primaries in the united states.
So before we begin a little bit of background.
In the united states the two major political parties choose their presidential candidates through a system of we'll say just primaries for the purposes of this debate.
In some of those primaries you have to be a party member to vote.
So for instance, you would have to be a member of the democratic party to vote in the democratic party primary.
In other states anyone is free to vote whether or not they're a member of that political party.
In the US it's fairly easy to join a political party, it's usually free, so we're going to say there's no significant barriers, for the purposes of this debate, to joining one of the two big political parties.
So with that in mind, three arguments for why we should abolish open primaries.
The first is that these undermine the purpose of a primary.
Recognize primaries do not exist to pick the next president.
They exist to express the will of people in the party about who they would like to see as that party's candidate.
This is why primaries aren't run by the government, contrary to popular belief.
They're run by the political parties.
We tell you that ultimately if you have an open primary it doesn't reflect the will of the party membership.
You could, for instance, in an area with relatively few republicans, have lots and lots of people who normally would identify as democrats vote and override the will of the republicans in that district.
We think that ultimately if you're going to have primaries in the first place, to allow the people to have input on party decisions, then you ought at least make sure that the people who are members of that party are able to express themselves.
Even if you don't have a situation like I described where people are outvoted, we still think that party members have comparatively less control when you have open primaries.
So for that reason we should abolish open primaries.
Our second argument is about sabotage.
It's very easy for people to vote for the other party's primary in order to get a worse candidate.
We see that many democrats did this with donald trump actually.
They were afraid that marco rubio or ted cruz would be better candidates so they went and voted in open primaries for the republicans in order to support donald trump, and in doing so they subverted the will of the republicans in that district in a very open, intentional way.
So again we think that that's a good enough reason to ban it because the actual republicans living in that district didn't have their will expressed.
But on top of that, while trump did go on to win, we see that it makes it easy for a party to undermine their opponents ability to choose a winning candidate.
So we think that at the point where parties have these primaries in order to choose candidates with a chance of winning, open primaries actually undermine your chance of getting a good candidate.
The other side might say that there are ways to correct for this, but we think that anytime you let people sabotage the other party they will.
Just think about conservatives who joined the labor party to support jeremy corbin for instance.
It's a similar phenomenon where enemies of a particular party joined in order to sabotage that party's success in elections.
Our third argument is about how this does damage to party conventions.
After you have all the primaries, all of the people from the primaries who were elected go to a big convention and then select who the candidate will be.
So for instance if michigan supported bernie sanders and new york supported hillary clinton, then all of their people go to the convention and the people from michigan vote for sanders and the people from new york vote for clinton and as we all know eventually clinton won out.
But the conventions are worse if you have people selected who don't actually reflect the will of the people.
They make it more likely that you can't elect anyone on the first round and that you have a longer more contentious convention.
When you have a more contentious race between candidates this means that you do more damage fighting each other and spend more time doing that then you would fighting against the republicans or the democrats from the other side.
So we see that ultimately this harms your ability to win general elections.
For all of these reasons we should abolish open primaries.
Thank you."
"We should protect edward snowden because edward snowden did an incredibly valuable public service and it took a great deal of self sacrifice having to leave the country he grew up in behind in order to really deeply help the people in that country.
So let's start by talking about why what he blew the whistle on is absolutely abhorrent and is something the government should have never been doing in the first place and certainly non-secret and then second, why it was necessary for him to take the actions that he took and circumvent like traditional like avenues of like essentially whistle blow illegally.
So let's start by talking about what exactly he did.
Obviously he uncovered a huge mass of national security surveillance.
A large deal of which the public wasn't really aware of and I think that this is inherently bad because there's a reason why we have several amendments in the US constitution that explicitly protect people's privacy in different ways.
Whether it's like freedom against searches and seizure or other kinds of things.
It's always been a right the right to privacy has always been one of the most important things in america and certainly a lot of our jurisprudence upholds this idea and the reason for that is just because people have the right to have like their own identity basically and control what people know about them, what people can possibly harass them based on and what people how people are going to live their lives and when the government has essentially like near infinite information on every single person in society, that creates like a huge problem and a lot of ways it's like a surveillance state type that is really really eerie and spooky in that the government would be able to monitor you at all times, know where you're going at all times, know everything that you're doing at all times, and these are things that certainly the government just should not know about you.
The government shouldn't know where you are every minute of the day.
The government shouldn't know who you're talking to every minute of the day because people should have the expectation of privacy, people being able to like keep communications like maybe between people who are close to them or business communications are all of these things private.
But beyond just like the fact that the government shouldn't have this information in the first place, the fact that the government is collecting all this information one place is an absolutely horrible and stupid idea especially in relation to cybersecurity.
So what would be easier?
Let's say that you want to get every single person in america so you want to get half of americans of a hundred forty million or so security numbers, what do you do if you want a hundred and forty million security numbers?
Do you hack equifax or do you hack a hundred and forty million people's individual computers and try to get those security numbers?
You're probably going to do the first one because that just makes way more sense because you're you're only having to do the thing once.
You're getting all that massive data at once that's more useful.
So when the government just compiles all of this sensitive information people's like phone like like records from like internet like transaction like basically like anything that you do that leaves some kind of a digital footprint, the government tries to illicitly collect data on, creates something that's incredibly vulnerable to hackers because the government certainly can't keep itself safe from hackers.
The CIA is getting hacked for christ sake.
Beyond that it's also a big problem that there was never sufficient public discussion about this.
There was never really consent to this in that the people never really knew the extent to which the government was actually watching them and the fact that there was so much uproar afterwards, the fact that the CI that the fact that the NSC an the CIA and all these other agencies had pressure put on them to try to change some of the tactics they're doing to make it at least a little bit better, shows how upset people were at what was happening.
That people didn't know that was happening in the first place.
That brings us to the final thing which is why was necessary that edward snowden did this?
Politicians didn't care, the people didn't know, and this was keep going to happen again and again for who knows how long.
Edward snowden took a stand and for those reasons we should protect him."
"Nationalism does more harm than good.
So, by nationalism we mean the intense love of a nation.
So, a good example of this might be that, some people in quebec very much love the idea of french canada, more so than they love other parts of their identity.
So, we think that that's a good example of nationalism.
So, three arguments: the first is that, we think nationalism is very divisive.
Recognize that, nations must compete with one another for nationalism to make sense.
Everyone's sense of love for their own nation is comparative: if you love quebec you don't love english speaking canada, for instance.
So, we think that, necessarily, this create some sort of divide between people, who are members of different nations, and some sort of feeling that, one nation is in competition with every other nation.
This is a lot of problems: first, in terms of rebellions.
We see that, although there hasn't been a lot of violence in recent years in quebec, historically, in other parts of the world, nationalism has been a big driver of violence.
World war one for instance, started because of nationalism in the balkans that made people resent the austrian empire.
Even though the governments, that replaced the austrian empire, weren't that different from the empire itself, people wanted to have a serbian king, rather than a german king, and that's what led to a lot of the conflict that, led to millions and millions of people dying, and this has been a recurring story throughout modern history.
We've seen nationalist rebellions in countries, from eastern europe to germany itself, to southeast asia, and africa, and millions of people have died as a result, even though the living conditions of people in those countries probably didn't improve as a result.
We think that, the natural outcome, therefore, of nationalism is that this divisiveness will lead to conflict, and war between nations.
Our second point is that nationalism is exclusive, and we think that this is a really dangerous thing, most people can't choose to opt in, or opt out, of the nation that they're part of.
It's kind of like being black or white, you're born into a certain nation.
So, if you're born in a certain part of canada you're quebecois, and if you're born elsewhere in canada you're not.
If you're born in one country, you're part of a certain nation, if you're born elsewhere, in the same country, you're part of a different nation.
So, we see that this could be very dangerous for minority groups, particularly, if you have a country that's based on a certain national identity, like say, germany being based on german identity, then people who live within the borders of that country, but aren't part of the nation, are always going to be viewed with suspicion.
This was a huge driver in anti semitic crimes in germany in the twentieth century, that jewish people, who lived in germany, and might have lived there for hundreds of years since the middle ages, were seen as not being part of the german nation, so they were actually a risk to the country, and this allowed leaders to scapegoat the jewish people, and this can be seen time and time again.
For jewish people, this has been a huge problem throughout history, as jews have been seen as not part of the nation, of the country, that they live in, but part of a jewish nation instead.
But this isn't the only example, if you look at chinese people in southeast asia, even if their ancestors have lived in a country like thailand for a hundred and fifty years, they're still viewed as part of the chinese nation, and viewed with suspicion, even though they're a citizen of thailand, and have been there for a very long time.
We think that, this ultimately means that, minority groups will be treated worse by the majority group, because they'll be seen as not part of the nation, and not really belonging in their own home country.
Which leads nicely into our last point, about why we think nationalism leads to unrealistic expectations.
We think that, countries and nations almost never perfectly overlap.
One reason is that, while countries have firm borders, the US canadian border is at a certain line on the map, nations tend to bleed over.
We see that, in places like europe, you have german speakers, living outside germany, who identify as part of the german nation, and this was one of the leading causes of world war two, was a desire to unify the german nation into one country.
But, when you have areas that are thirty percent german, and thirty percent polish, and forty percent czech, how do you reconcile that?
We think that, nationalism leads to an expectation that you can unify your nation, but that's never possible without large scale population transfers, or terrible crimes being committed.
A good example of this would be greece and turkey, two countries that have a lot of national enmity historically.
In the early twentieth century, all turks were exiled from greece to turkey, and all greeks were exiled from turkey to greece, and millions of people lost their homes, and no good came of it for the people who actually lived in those areas.
But because of nationalism, it was expected that this would be good.
Nationalism encourages a certain naive idealism, that we don't think that can ever be resolved, without really harming the people, who were affected by the policies created as a result.
So for these reasons, I think it's very clear that nationalism does more harm than good."
"We should ban trans fat usage in food.
So trans fats are a particular type of fat which has been isolated by chemists.
We can identify it really well, and it's included in lots of popular foods like oreos, cupcakes, etcetera.
So this is something that has been banned by some legislatures around the world, places like new york city, places like denmark because it's uniquely, even more so than some other types of fats, very unhealthy.
So we're saying get rid of it in food entirely.
We're going to set this in liberal countries which have enough money to actually, you know, regulate food well through things like the FDA in america or similar regulatory bodies in europe.
So, two arguments.
The first is about why we think it is just for the state to intervene in order to prevent people from being able to buy foods with trans fats.
Two standards for when we think the state should intervene to limit personal freedom.
The first is when there is an a limited access of information for ordinary people.
So say that your joe america, just some guy at the grocery store buying food.
You probably don't have a lot of information about how to know if a food contains trans fats, what trans fats actually do, how they interact with the rest of your diet, how much of them is actually safe to consume.
You have basically no way of informing yourself about this issue, whereas on the other hand, the companies selling these trans fats you know hostess, little debbie, whoever it may be, they have all these chemists, they have scientists, they have lawyers.
They know exactly how much trans fats are safe to consume, what they do to your body, how they affect your diet.
What does this mean?
It's very easy for the company who has access to a ton of information to manipulate you as an individual consumer so that you make it unhealthy choice that puts dollars in their wallet.
They want you to buy as much of their product as possible, which means that because these trans fats are very tasty, they want you to put as many or they want to put as many of them as they can into the foods so that you'll buy it.
Ultimately, you have no way to protect yourself from this abuse because you don't even know that it's going on.
We think the government needs to intervene because government scientists, government lawyers, other people working for the state, had access to this information and work on your behalf.
We think that they need to step in and really act on your behalf by limiting your access to these trans fats.
The second time when we see that the government should intervene is when there is a harm to a third party.
We think where this really comes up is in the form of children that you know, obviously children can't make a decision about what foods their parents feed them.
If you're a kid, you eat what your mom buys you.
But ultimately, these trans fats have tremendous effects on the long term health of children.
They put them at greater risk of obesity and heart disease later in life.
We think that the state needs to intervene to protect children in particular from these trans fats because their parents aren't able to protect them, so there's a harm being made by the parent's decision onto someone else through no fault of their own.
We think that that's a clear instance when government should intervene.
This is the same reasoning behind why we banned smoking, which is that secondhand smoke hurts people in the same way these trans fats are also hurting people.
And the last time when we think that the government ought intervene is when there's a compelling state interest.
What we mean by that?
So the state, in most countries, is paying for healthcare, whether that be medicaid in the US, or national health in britain, or other insurance plans around the world.
So we see that the government is spending more money if people are less healthy.
At that point, the state has a clear interest in maximizing individual health in order to limit the amount of money that it has to spend on healthcare.
If we free up money that would be spent on people who become obese because of trans fats, then we have more money to spend on things like researching a cure for diabetes, or treating people with cancer, etcetera.
So I think it's clear that the state has an obligation to intervene to ban the use of trans fats in these foods.
If it did so, it would improve public health, it would protect individuals who are being taken advantage of, it would protect the vulnerable such as children, and ultimately that it would lower healthcare costs for society.
Thank you."
"We should abolish intellectual property rights because intellectual property rights do a tremendous amount of social harm.
So I want to start by talking about the problem the big problem of intellectual property.
Because the first thing is that intellectual property is everywhere.
Every time you look at a logo.
Every time you look at a symbol.
Every time you look at a song.
Every listen to a song anytime you watch a movie anytime you look at a work of art anytime you use any kind of product that has some kind of innovation to it so whether it's like some kind of formula in your tooth paste some kind of like algorithm in like a a phone calculator some kind of like like process that is used to create like a micro a computer chip literally like a like the patents and intellectual property and things like that are everywhere.
So when you're doing this what is the big problem?
When you have some kind of patent or when you have intellectual property over something you create a true monopoly over something.
If you were the an inventor of that thing and you like and whatever that means that you're have like a true monopoly over it because now you can literally take legal action against anyone who tried to create an alternative or something similar to your product.
And that creates a big problem because it gives you a total monopoly which means that you can charge whatever you want.
And oftentimes when this is something that is an innovation this means that this product can be incredibly expensive and it can be pricing out a whole lot of people.
The most basic example of this being present is when you look at something like the pharmaceutical industry.
When you look at a product that is oftentimes incredibly important and demand is incredibly inelastic because people need drop like people need medicine regardless similar to the way that like people need like technology nowadays regardless people need a whole lot of things were taught irrespective the price.
So that's important because that means that people can literally charge the most exorbitant prices and price out a whole lot of poor people that need it or it can make but like the public funding of something incredibly difficult to do.
Now that's a huge problem because this means that people truly actually get harm because of this.
If people have less access to technology people have less access to innovation.
People have less access to life saving medications or people simply get less enjoyment because they're not able to you even afford music like on a basic level.
Like these are kind of like really basic things that I think are like govern the way people live their lives and it's a really sad thing and I think that when you don't have intellectual property rights and you allow more people actually access to good it's obviously going to do a whole lot more good to society and I think that's like an incredibly important thing.
And intellectual property isn't like the only thing that you need to do to incentivize creation of things like you can give you like like you can do things like require the licensing of generic alternatives and give people profits for that maybe like a licensing fee or something like that.
And just regulate it you can give people money like based off of the social impact that they give like there's like a lot of things like social impact on the social impact investing in things like that.
These aren't necessarily like unheard of things that you can do.
There's definitely there's definitely alternatives or you can just try to foster like a more collaborative system so when you're talking about things like technology innovation for example oftentimes these things can be done with like open source alternatives and it can be done in a more collaborative sense that's going to be more accessible to people.
So I think that a lot of context it's not just necessarily like the like oh like a dichotomy of having something verse not having something and having to deal with the like harms of intellectual property.
I definitely think that there are alternatives that exist and I think that there's a whole lot of social good that comes out of a abolishing intellectual property so for those reasons we should abolish it."
"We should criminalize blasphemy.
Freedom of expression is meant to protect people that wish to voice unpopular opinions from persecution.
It is not meant to allow people to offend others and make them feel persecuted.
This is why probably wearing a swastika is forbidden in the united states and rightfully so.
We will show that there's an analogy to be made between swastikas and blasphemy.
So if opposition will wish to defend one of these things on the grounds of freedom of expression, it should also defend the other.
For many religious people that truly believe in god or muhammad, or jesus, and in their sanctity, this is a highly sensitive topic.
Being a witness to the mockery of one of these figures isn't just making them feel uncomfortable, it makes them feel that they somehow have sinned.
That their purity is now compromised and it might even risk their chances of redemption in the next world.
There's a difference between criticizing something and mocking it.
The freedom of expression does allow me to argue with a religious friend of mine and try to convince him to see the light and beauty of the secular life and vice versa.
And thank god for that.
Or not god if you're secular.
This is mutually beneficial.
It helps both sides.
I can even, in a moment of anger, be less articulate and just slam in my friend's face that he ought to be crazy in order to believe in god.
But the line is crossed the very minute that I really aim to hurt my friend by mocking his faith.
For instance, characterizing muhammad.
By doing so I'm not expressing an opinion, but sheerly, aggressively attacking the other person in order to belittle him.
This is verbal violence.
Same as if I say that something like if they say something mean about someone's mother.
I'm intentionally targeting a weak spot and using it in order to belittle and infuriate the other side.
Now it's hard enough to deal with your mom being mocked, but when your faith is mocked, that puts you in an even harder position.
First, because there's no way to pay back in kind to the person to the person insulting you.
Everyone has a mom but not like for non believers there's no such thing of the same magnitude that you can attack in order to get even.
Secondly, and that's the more important part, cursing god is a sin, probably punishable by death.
A highly religious person truly believes that.
As far as he's concerned, it's up to him to restore the lord's honor by punishing the person that's committed blasphemy, but obviously he can't do anything about it in return because the law forbids it.
So as long as blasphemy is criminalized, that person can at least file a complaint or alert the authorities and so he would get some form of punishing done.
But otherwise, the insults stays unresponded to, and as far as religious as religion goes, and as far as the believers point of view, that's his own personal failure.
He failed to protect the honor of his god and maybe god is angry with him right now.
So for that person, this is not just humiliating, but also terrifying.
He now needs to live in fear that this might have cost him his ticket to heaven, and that's way worse than anything you could do to him in this life.
Now opposition can try and attack this logic by saying that one's subjective feelings shouldn't be shouldn't be like relevant in a decision whether something should be banned.
But we disagree.
Ask yourself, which is worse?
To vandalize an apartment building or a synagogue?
Naturally we understand that the latter is more severe and it's not because the objective damage is somehow bigger, but because of the emotional value invested in this house of worship and because of what it symbolizes.
This is why we care about preserving sacred sites.
This is where we can draw the analogy to wearing a swastika in public.
Here as well, as far as objective harm, nothing happened.
It's all about the subjective feelings that this act invokes.
But when it comes to such intense feelings that can result in the actual distress of other people, we can confidently say that the freedom of expression is over.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish the two party system.
What we mean by this is that rather than having just the republicans and the democrats you'd also have any other third party, similar to like the systems that we currently have in israel.
And essentially you'd, instead of having to claim a majority of the votes, you would just have to claim a plurality in order to win a given election.
With that three main areas of clash: first on why it creates more options for individuals.
Currently, there are a couple of situations that people find themselves in when they're casting their vote.
Either they're hard core hard line republicans or democrats that have been voting with their party forever.
All this means is that they're going to continue to do so unless their party do something truly egregious, but the majority of the time even if their party does do something truly egregious they feel like they don't have any other option but to continue voting for them because they feel like the other party is worse.
We want a world in which you're not just trying to beat the other party on being less bad, rather we want you to have to prove that you're actually the best.
The other scenario is that your a swing vote.
In which case the same thing I just that applies.
You're going to have parties trying to show you that the other one is bad because there's only one party to beat.
They don't actually have a incentive to highlight what is better or unique about them, they just have an incentive to like throw as much mud as possible.
But the third scenario is that you're a third party voter, and the unfortunate case here is that in the united states you're essentially throwing away your vote.
Third parties never win.
In fact, they barely even get enough votes to like be a threat to anyone, in reality.
And in the worst case scenarios, such as this past election, third party helps the worst kind of thing win.
A really good example of a world in which of a scenario in which it would help to have multiple parties is actually this past election.
You had donald trump and you had hillary clinton, and there were a lot of people who really really really really hated trump.
Like he's a problem and his racist and he's sexist.
But they also really really disliked hillary clinton, which was really fair because there's a lot of shady stuff in our history, like they didn't want another another monarchy president.
But regardless of these issues, what ended up happening is that they were so principally opposed to both of these candidates that they voted third party.
But because third party doesn't actually matter, all that ended up happening is that it contributed to donald trump winning the election.
We don't think that people should have to choose between the lesser of two evils and we never think that their vote shouldn't matter.
We also think the system you have currently breeds a lot of apathy.
You get used to having some issue, some issues completely overlooked by the party and get used to having to prioritize what you might find most important in a given election cycle.
We don't think people should have to make these compromises.
Our second area of clash is how it provides more options for budding politicians.
Because right now you often join a specific party and you sit on their campaigns and you help them and eventually maybe run for office, but this comes with a lot of compromises along the way.
Like a lot of people start out incredibly idealistically, and then as they further their career a lot of their policies are considered not like palatable to the general public, or not the policy of that given election cycle, or maybe even you don't actually do the like same but you maybe you don't agree with what your party stands on.
But I think when you provide more parties to choose from, you actually get a world in which budding politicians don't have to compromise their own beliefs.
Our third area of clash is how you get better political systems.
Currently are our two parties are stuck in innovative ruts.
They've been the republicans and democrats fighting each other for years and years and so a lot of their a lot there are certain issues that just remain dormant.
Lake this election cycle the really big deal was immigration reform and healthcare, and so things like reproductive rights seem to go to the wayside and we defer to the typical republican arguments.
We think the only world in which you're actually forced to be more innovative is one in which you're competing with new in previous undealt-with parties.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"We should abolish temporary employment?
So in this debate, we're talking about countries with strong labor regulations, like the US, canada, wherever, and that they should abolish temporary employment, things like temp agencies, which are like placement agencies that, help you get short term work, seasonal workers.
So, if you think about strawberry pickers in california, these people tend to only work for a couple of months out of the year, and then they travel to another area to work on a different type of farm.
So, these are the types of things that we're talking about abolishing.
Two big arguments: the first is that, we think that the system of temporary employment is abusive to workers.
Basically, what it does is shifts all of the risk of the economy onto vulnerable workers, and away from wealthy business owners.
How does this work?
So, when you have this big reserve pool of labor, you have lots of people who are desperate for any kind of work they can get, who are at the whims of employers.
Employers can hire people, and give them no health benefits, no way to provide for their family, they pay very low wages, and there's lots of people who are desperate to get this type of work, because they don't have anything else.
So what this means is that, employers can bring people in, for, say, three months to meet demand.
In doing so, they, first of all, are able to hire fewer full time staff.
Recognize that, the trade off of temporary employment is fewer permanent employees, because why would you want to have ten people on staff, if you only need six of them in july, but you need all ten in december?
He'll just get rid of them, and replace them with temps, who also don't take up health insurance money, and things like that.
But aside from that, we think that it's abusive to employees, because it commodified them, it strips away everything individual about these people, it strips away their ability to improve themselves, and leaves them being treated solely as someone who is able to do the most basic of task, for a handful of weeks, and then be kicked out to the curb, with no consideration and no rights from their employer.
So, we think that, it would be better to abolish temporary employment to increase per full time employment, and also because we think that, if you had these people who are unemployed, and there was no temporary employment, that new opportunities for full time employment would open up, as a result from different businesses that would want to take advantage of skill sets that aren't available right now, because laborers are commodified, and employers aren't looking at their individual skills.
Our second argument is about how this limits the economic potential of a country.
So, we think that as a government, you ought abolish this, because it will lead to more economic growth if you were to do so.
These temporary employers are effectively wasting millions of man hours every year in your country, because if people are working two months as a farm hand, and two months as a factory worker, and a month here as a seasonal employee for something, at the end of the day, these people are spending a lot of time between jobs, when they're not working.
These are people who aren't contributing to your gross domestic product, who aren't paying taxes, who are probably taking up unemployment, and things like that.
So, you have a clear financial incentive, as a government, to want the economy to grow, and to want people to be employed, so you should abolish this.
But on top of that, people need long term employment, in order to be able to grow the economy through investment.
If people have long term jobs, then they're more willing to save, they're more willing to invest, they're willing to get educated, so that they can get promoted at their work, and all of these things will lead to your workers being more competitive, relative to other countries.
It'll lead to them putting more effort into their work, and ultimately contributing more to the economy as a whole.
So, I think it's clear that as a government you would benefit from this, and that the citizens in your country, who rely on you as a government, would benefit from it as well.
So for these two reasons, we should abolish temporary employment, thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should introduce a flat tax.
What this means is that in the united states where we currently tout a progressive tax the majority of the time we would instead institute we would replace that tax with only a flat tax which would take the same percentage of income from everyone regardless of how high their income is.
So someone who was earning a hundred thousand dollars a year would still pay more in taxes than someone earning only forty thousand but only because of the percentage not because the percentage goes up as you pay as you as you earn more.
Three main areas of clash, first on the principle of fairness in this situation.
We think that at the end of the day, wages are meant to evaluate the labor that you put in and different forms of labor are worth different amount not even due to an objective metric but rather because of the way that society values that, making this actually one of the most democratic systems that currently exists.
It basically says that because that we take all these criteria, how much energy you put into something: how much schooling you had to go through, how much that schooling maybe cost.
And we say this is the metric by which we evaluate how many how much your wages are and we think this is like the market is a pretty is does like a pretty good job of this insofar as clearly people are still willing to go into any number of positions regardless of their wages, it just changes the barriers in between.
So we think that doctors make more than fry cooks because society values the effort that both jobs require and how much of an energy commitment they are and decided that being a doctor deserves more compensation.
Given that we understand that we think that how much each career makes influences then how like what those people choose to put into it, so we think that everyone has access to the information that a doctor makes more than a fry cook and given this they make an educated decision based on this knowledge in combination with their knowledge of how much education they might need etcetera etcetera and become either a doctor or a fry cook.
So given that you need to so given the end of that whatever you earn is in exchange for your labor, it becomes the property of that individual who earned it.
Taxes regardless of what kind they are are a state are a form of state supported theft but given that you need some tax for public good that everyone agrees is necessary like roads are something that everyone needs etcetera we think that it's fundamentally unjust to steal more from some people on the basis of their income and that you need to promote a hard line when it comes to state sponsored thefts as to what is justified and what is not.
So we think that it's only fair if it's the same percentage from each person given that that way you're stealing the same percentage from each person.
Our second area of clash is about encouraging innovation.
We think that getting more money is an incentive for people to exert themselves more than they are necessarily comfortable exerting themselves and a progressive tax removes the incentive because it reduces the margin of difference in economic growth.
It makes the trade off of time for money harder to justify if the money is marginal in terms of its increase.
We need but we need people to have an incentive to work harder in order to achieve greater efficiency like at the end of the day we need someone to serve as the manager or the boss or the director and if the extra hours that they spend in the professional arena does not justify the amount of money that they earn because the progressive tax takes off so much of their raise, then we're just not going to have anyone who's willing to become those because everyone loves maximizing the time they spend at home or relaxing.
But we also think this is really important in terms of maximizing peoples' incentives to create and to innovate like physically.
We think the reason we have the majority of the great inventions in the world have to do with because we like respect patents and respect intellectual property.
Our third area of clash is just on why it maximizes efficiency.
We think that it gets rid of having to file for taxes, no dividends, no IRS rules to comply with, which just makes the entire tax process a lot easier.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should subsidize women in science.
So, we're going to lay out a model for what this actually looks like in our world.
We would subsidize business tax rates for stem companies that hire women in stem roles.
So, it's not just an IBM company hiring a secretary, but it's an IBM-type company hiring someone to actually do an engineering role or something that involves the sciences.
And this subsidy in as far as the tax will be proportional to the overall wage gap between men and women.
This is something that is widely known already.
We don't think this is new information.
Additionally, we would provide women who attend stem programs at public colleges significantly reduced tuition at a proportional level to the family's ability to pay.
So, we think many women would be able to go to college for free for these programs, and those that are coming from wealthier families would still get a significant subsidy.
So, first reason we think this is necessary is for historical reparations.
Women have been historically oppressed have been have been a historically oppressed class throughout the history of the human race.
This, of course, is very based on other factors such as class and race, but women generally have been subjugated and placed in subservient roles for the vast majority of human history.
This has left a cultural mark even in our modern society.
Generations of viewing women in subservient roles has created impressions on all people through both our our upbringing and our media about how women should behave and what roles are appropriate for them.
Even in our modern society has granted women freedoms in law that allow them to pursue the outcomes they choose, there're still massive barriers that exist that these freedoms do not help to correct for, such as not having a female coworker in the office, such as people viewing you as not being deserving of a job as compared to another male counterpart.
And these barriers are still the result of our collective construction of female roles and therefore, it's still our collective responsibility to solve them even if law itself can't do the job.
Stem fields are one of those roles that are historically preserved for men.
Women were largely kept out of the educational sector.
Women allowed to learn were rarely given legitimate opportunity to succeed.
Historic repression steers women to other fields because of the historical memory of not being allowed into these fields, meaning those that now enter it are often isolated in a man's world, an incredibly difficult environment to work in.
Subsidizing this is one way to get women into these roles and the more women in these roles, the more we break the stigma and given and give other women allies in the workforce, women that are already there.
We think that when you break the stigma, you get a tidal wave, and this will have a major impact.
Secondly, we think there's just public good to this.
Women are a huge portion of the population and having significant increase in stem employees would be massively beneficial.
First of all, economically, stem fields are some of the highest-paying professions in the modern economy, and many jobs remain open now because of a lack of qualified candidates.
So there are existing jobs that need to be filled.
Adding women to these jobs simultaneously raises their likely take-home pay and quality of life, improving the lives of the women in these roles, but it also fills important jobs for businesses that are changing and growing the economy.
These are businesses that are on the cutting edge of technology that are improving lives, that are putting out products that sell and grow the economy, and these are roles that need to be filled in order for them to do that at their maximal capacity.
But on a second level, technologically, more women in science simply means more brain power for advancements in scientific discoveries and technologies that could improve our overall well-being.
We think that in the last several decades we've seen massive improvements in quality of life all over the world, and a large reason for this is our technological advancement as a species.
Adding brain power to that advancement, adding this new group of people that has been subject that that's been viewed as subservient and not given a fair shake in these roles is one way to improve that overall arc of history and improve our technological advancement.
For these reasons, we should subsidize women in science."
"We should increase tax credits.
On our side, we think that government should offer people more tax credits for doing things that are beneficial for society, for instance, things like the earned income tax credit that you can get in america if you have children, or tax credits for saving, tax credits for starting new businesses, all of these things that are very risky and expensive for people but that are ultimately good for the country and the economy as a whole.
We think tax credits are an effective way to incentivize people.
So, on our side, we're going to talk about why we prefer using carrots rather than sticks to motivate people and, also, why we think this can correct unfairness in existing tax policy.
So, first of all, what do I mean by carrots and sticks?
We think that you can motivate people either by offering them something or by threatening them.
In effect, when you tax a harmful policy, for instance, when you tax alcohol, you're using the stick.
You're making people pay more and punishing them for doing something that's antisocial, namely, purchasing alcohol, whereas when you give a tax credit, you're using the carrot.
You're giving people a reward for doing something that's good, like having children or starting a business.
We would argue that people generally respond better to a reward than a punishment.
Whereas people just resent being punished, people hate the idea of higher taxes, they hate the idea of sin or luxury taxes, people generally just are happy when they get a reward.
They don't think about the fact that the end effect is the same: they're paying more or less in taxes, because people are emotional, not completely rational.
So they just see: hey, I'm getting a check back from the government this april because of something that I did.
That's a really good thing.
I feel good about that, and I'm happy with the fact that the government is giving me this check.
So we think that you're more likely to change people's behavior using a carrot rather than a stick, using an incentive rather than a punishment.
And why are tax credits such a good form of this?
Well, first of all, they don't really take a big bureaucracy to manage.
You just have people tell you what tax credits they deserve, and then you give them a check, and then you can find if people are committing fraud by auditing them, the same way you already run audits.
So there's very little overhead and, moreover, they're pretty easy to implement.
You just tell people: write down how many children you have, write down if you have a business, check this box if you own a farm, that kind of thing, and then a computer can even tell you whether people are eligible for this tax credit.
So, there's not a lot of overhead, and it's a very effective policy for that reason.
We think any government tax reform needs to be simple, otherwise, there's going to be lots of loopholes.
But the tax credits tend to avoid that problem.
Our next argument is that we think this can correct for unfairness in tax policy.
Right now, there are a lot of problems with the tax code in the united states.
For instance, it taxes people more for income as opposed to investments, that is to say income from a job rather than investments.
It taxes people an unfair amount if they have children versus if they don't, and things like that.
We think that tax credits con solve for this.
For instance, by giving people a tax credit if they have children, you can offset the increased burden that they have from having more dependents.
Similarly, people tend to be taxed more on income that they earn from owning a business than income they earn from having money in the stock market.
So a tax credit can kind of offset that difference by rewarding people for having a business and encouraging them to invest in starting businesses rather than just passively investing in the stock market which, of course, is good, because we want there to be economic growth from entrepreneurship.
On our side of the house, we've explained why, ultimately, this can rectify injustices in the tax code.
We've explained why it's better for individuals and also why it's a better way for the government to motivate people towards the same ends that you would get if you just taxed other behaviors more.
For all these reasons, we should increase tax credits.
Thank you."
"We should privatize the united states social security.
So for those who don't know, here in the US, we have this program called social security.
It's basically a giant fund that everyone who works pays into, there's something called a payroll tax that everyone pays regardless of your income, I think it's about ten percent of your income.
And then when you retire, based on the amount that you paid into the fund, you receive a certain amount back as a check every month from the month you retire up until the month that you pass away.
So, you keep receiving that flat amount, regardless of how much or based on how much you paid in even if you live forty years after you retire, like my grandfather did.
So with that in mind, we have three arguments for you for why it would be better if we privatize social security.
And by the way, we think that what that means is that people would have a personal retirement savings account, but there would be a mandatory contribution.
So the ten percent of your income that would go to social security in the status quo, in our world, you would be required to put into a private fund which then you would choose to invest however you would, albeit we'd encourage people, you know, to put it in the low risk funds, but they would have some leeway over that.
Three arguments for you.
The first is that this would be better for retirees.
Realize that when you put money into the social security fund, you're basically making an interest-free loan to the american government.
Why is this true?
If you took all of your money and put it into the stock market, then you would reap the benefits of all of the interest.
So, over the long term, the market tends to return about five percent on investment.
So but we see that individuals don't reap anything like that from social security.
Instead, every year, congress raids the social security fund for the general fund in order to subsidize discretionary spending.
So basically congress is borrowing money from social security at zero percent interest to the american people, who are lending them all of this money and not receiving anything in return.
What we think that retirees, if they're going to lend money while they're working, should see some return on that.
There is certainly is risk to this lending.
So ultimately people would retire with a lot more money, because all of the money that they lend out, they would actually receive a return on.
The city of houston pioneered a program similar to this, and virtually everyone retired a millionaire, whereas most people who retire with social security live in abject poverty.
The second argument that we have for you is about why social security is not sustainable.
And this there are two arguments to this.
The first is that social security is a ponzi scheme.
What do I mean by that?
Social security relies on the idea that there will be more people paying in at any one time than there were people receiving, because individuals pay in much less than they take out.
When this program was founded in the thirties, you know, you retire at sixty five, I think most people lived to be sixty eight, so you were collecting for like two or three years.
But now people live into their eighties all the time, they're collecting for fifteen, twenty years.
So people receive much more money than they actually paid in, which means that you need more young people working, many more young people working, paying into the system than retirees in order to make it solvent.
But if you look at the demographics of america, there are many more people who are in their fifties and sixties than there are people in their twenties and thirties, which means that the whole system is a house of cards that is going to collapse in a few years' time.
We think it'd be better if people saved for themselves, so they weren't dependent on a smaller body of workers to take care of them in their old age.
The last thing that we're going to say is that social security is going to go bankrupt.
Most people think by the twenty thirties.
Because congress has been borrowing, basically stealing money from social security since the seventies, all of the interest that should have accrued has not accrued, which means that the fund is running out of money.
Right now it's still growing at a tiny rate, but as all of the baby boomer generation retires, the fund is going to run dry, and everyone who is contributing who is my age or twenty years older is going to see nothing in return for their investment in social security.
So for these reasons, we should privatize social security in the united states.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban alcoholic beverages.
So what we mean by this is that it would no longer be legal to sell or produce anything that has alcohol in it.
People caught consuming, people caught selling, or possessing would be faced with a fine, and after increased offenses would first face a raised fine and then face jail time.
So two main areas of clash: first on harms to self and others.
Because we think that the government generally has two main reasons that they can ban something and infringe a persons autonomy, and the first of them is that they can prove that this is a uncontextualized harm to themselves.
The second is that there are externalities that the person cannot predict and does not have the right to commit, and the third is that there's a pertinent government interest.
So we are going to be addressing the first two in this first argument.
So recognize first that drinking destroys the lever, it takes people out of reality, it's incredibly addictive and generally it has all of these really bad impacts on people who consume, even a little bit, but especially too much alcohol.
And we don't think that you can consent, because you can't conceptualize what that addiction does to your brain and body.
First because people believe that they can control their intake and their urges.
The amount of times that I've heard people say: "" this is not a problem. ""
As they reach for the bottle or reach for the pillbox.
Because in the end people are unable to conceptualize what is a problem for themselves, because they are so convinced that they are powerful and capable of controlling themselves, and they see it a shameful when they can't.
But second, because the culture blinds people to this problem.
It's shown in the media and glamorized and shown as this like: "" I'm a hard worker.
Look how much I need to drink to work that off. ""
At the point that everything around you is messaging that you don't have a problem, we think your ability to recognize when you do is severely impeded to the point that you cannot contextualize those future harms.
You can't contextualize dependency or how much money you're going to end up spending on this or how it's going to destroy your relationships with others.
Because you're always going to be in denial.
But even if you can consent, we think that kids and surrounding people around you don't.
Drinking doesn't just impact the individual.
It destroys families.
First, it's incredibly expensive.
Especially for a lot of families where they're like there like lower to upper middle class, or very very poor and they're targeted by targeted advertisements for alcohol.
And at the point that this occurs, we think that it's really painful monetarily, when you have a choice between may be saving for like a better trip for your family, or like school supplies, and instead you're spending that money on alcohol to support a dependency.
But we also think it's incredibly emotionally problematic.
Right?
Seeing your parent incapacitated at a young age and feeling like they're going to pay more attention to the bottle than you, is very dangerous and we don't think that we should be opening up the doors to that.
There's also a lot of accident related kind of problems: car accidents that are caused by over drinking, violent accidents that are caused by over drinking, we think that the actually the majority of car accidents include someone who is intoxicated and we think the only way you prevent these kinds of mistakes is by banning alcohol at all.
We think that people don't have, even if people have a right to harm themselves they don't have a right to harm others and thus we must ban it.
But our second area of clash demonstrates that there is a viable government interest, just in case you didn't believe the first point enough.
As we already mentioned, there are a lot of alcohol driven crimes that the government takes the brunt of.
Right?
Car accidents, violent crimes.
This fills jails court fees and then money that is personally spent on alcohol and insurance instead of something that would help the economy or benefit individual families.
It also breaks up families.
Neglected kids are often left to be borne by schools who have to feed them and take care of them or even worse, they end up as part of the system that is already over burdened and cannot deal with more children.
We also think that there are that alcoholics are generally inefficient and therefore aren't as productive in society.
And given that the government has an interest in society being productive, we think this in itself means that the government should be able to regulate whether or not alcohol is banned.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should further exploit sustainable energies.
So quickly a model for what we think this motion actually is about.
We ought to create subsidies for clean energy production, green energy production.
We have subsidized companies that produce that type of energy and we would also create subsidies and tax breaks for private corporations and households that became dependent on green tech or solely use green tech in their productions.
We think that this would lead to more adoption of these sustainable energies and we want to aggressively further exploit those.
So two big arguments.
The first is about global warming and the second is about the economic boom that sustainable energy creates.
So on global warming, we think it is undeniable that global warming is the biggest threat to humanity's survival in the next one hundred years.
There were a few things that we know are coming on the horizon and that we need to act aggressively in order to prevent the worse outcomes from occurring.
What are these types of things?
First, rising sea levels which not only have the impact of creating warmer waters and leading to more extreme weather weather conditions such as more extreme hurricanes and tropical storms that we've seen in the recent past create tremendous amounts of economic and human destruction.
But also when you have rising sea levels the areas that are most impacted by these rising sea levels our cities.
Countries have developed in such a way where cities are on large bodies of water, usually in coastal areas, and huge population hubs are in these areas.
That means that when these cities begin to flood and deteriorate, you have massive urban migration, massive human displacement, and massive economic collapse when the hubs of your economy start being under water.
The other thing that's likely to come is a lack of food because of increased heat waves and less regular seasons which means the production of food becomes much more difficult and a lack of clean water.
Both of these things we think are lead to are likely to lead to more conflict in the future not just destruction from our environment but also destruction from ourselves.
We are rapidly approaching the tipping point that is the point of no return.
We think that in order to make this change we need to act now and we need to act quickly in adopting sustainable energy.
We need to care about this for a few reasons.
First, our own survival but more importantly the survival of our children who we're forcing to come into this world people that did not have any desire to come into this world, no have nor have any responsibility for the harms that global warming are going to wreck on our environment.
We only have one planet and our species survival totally depends on ensuring that we don't ruin that planet in the next one hundred years.
Sustainable energy in the form of clean energy is essential to make this happen.
The CO two emissions, the methane emissions that we are currently producing are the reason for this global warming and sustainable clean energy that doesn't have these types of emissions will go a long way in preventing the worst possible outcomes.
Secondly, the economic boom.
We think that sustainable clean energy is already profitable and is only going to become more so in the future.
This doesn't require expensive clean energy doesn't require expensive and potentially harmful drilling and mining procedures.
Not only harmful to the environment but also harmful to the workers that are there in these dangerous environments.
Secondly, clean tech becoming more is becoming more and more efficient every year and there's a much faster rate of increased efficiency than coal or oil powered engines are able electrical generation are able to compete with which means that per energy created clean energy, green tech sustainable energy is going to become more and more valuable while oil and coal and these other type of fossil fuels remain stagnant.
We also think that there are new jobs in these developing fields whereas if you look at coal mining for example in recent years, there's a dramatic drop off in the amount of job opportunities which means that this is good not only for efficiency and not only for electrical output but also good for creating jobs.
We also think that these fields require more technical innovation and technological innovation which we think is likely to open up the development of new fields and even further jobs based on the need for that further tech.
We think that sustainable energy is the clear solution to one of the most significant threats that humanity faces and for these reasons, we should further exploit sustainable energy."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should adopt mobile payments.
What we mean by this is that we would prefer a world in which the use of mobile payments is normalized and preferable to the use of credit or debit card or cash, and that you would make stores compatible with apps such as venmo or other mobile payment apps.
Two main areas of clash, the first on efficiency.
We tell you that mobile payments are much easier to use than other regular ways in which people transfer cash.
We think that the other ways in which we pay each other oftentimes involves either exact amounts of cash, which requires you to either have change on you, or have like preplanned what you are doing, or it requires you to like have an active debit or credit card, which can often be something that is very stressful for an individual, but also like easy to lose, easy did like not have on you at that moment.
We think that what mobile payment allow you to do is that because everyone often has a phone on them, or some sort of mobile device that can allow you to transfer money one another, is that it lets you lets you make transactions without extensive planning beforehand.
It is much easier to split payments between multiple people this way and eliminates the cash dilemma when there's not enough change or if someone only has solid bills.
A lot of tension in friend groups and between individuals is caused by difficulties with money or difficulties with like trust and with regards to whether or not someone will give you their money back.
Apps like venmo, that let you easily pay someone back an exact change at that exact moment, create a freer exchange of goods.
We think that it is generally positive when people have more options and aren't limited by the cash that they brought.
This is both good on an individual level, because someone gets to make more autonomous decisions about where they want to spend their cash.
You no longer have to make a lesser like a decision of lesser quality because you're limited by how much you have on you at that moment, or like something similar, or limited by the amount that other people have on them at that time.
But we also think that it's good for the economy.
Because we think that it's the case that a lot of people sometimes go out hoping to like do a certain thing and then end up not being and like if they see something along the way, end up not being able to purchase it, or purchase this service because they didn't plan for it that day and didn't bring that money with them.
Mobile payments eliminate this and make people much and make it much easier for people to exchange goods and services in a like easier flow of cash way.
Our second main area of clash has to do with why mobile payments are much more secure.
It's important to understand the alternatives, which are basically sending money through mail, if you're paying someone for a large purchase such as rent or something like that, exchanging cas cash with each other or using a credit or debit card.
We think that it's a lot easier for checks to get stolen and for debit and other cards to get compromised.
Because oftentimes it's as simple as someone sticking an appendage on an ATM and hoping that you don't notice, and suddenly they have your credit card number.
The use of of apps and like other mobile payments is that oftentimes these are private and on your phone and it connects only to your device, so it's very difficult for someone else to acquire the information that you are typing in and it usually uses end to end encryption that protects you much better than, like using mobile payments, than other things like exchanging cash or cards is.
So in addition to the fact that it is just more fluid and allows you to have more exact amounts, it is also much more secure and protects you from theft.
We also think that we should prioritize the safety of the money given that when people feel more secure in the money that they spend, they are more willing to spend more of it, or do riskier things with it.
So we think that things that allow transfers between cards as well as accounts such as venmo are very positive for people's personal feelings and this gets kind of expounded when they choose to spend on the outside world.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"We should protect the antarctic continent.
So by this we mean that antarctica should be made an international nature reserve where nobody is allowed to drill for oil or minerals, or exploit the wildlife, or whatever other resources may exist on the continent.
And on top of that, we think that under the scope of protecting it, it should be considered as international property in the same way that the open ocean is in the status quo.
So with that in mind, we have three arguments for you.
The first is about antarctica as the last major wilderness.
So this is the last big territory that hasn't been exploited for resources yet because technology hasn't made it possible to do so up until the current day.
Recognize that the value of antarctica as a wilderness is irreplaceable.
After you have exploited virgin land, it can never go back to its original state.
Any damage that you do is likely to be permanent especially with things like mineral extraction that can fundamentally change the shape and lay-out of the landscape.
We think that there are probably unknown benefits and bounties to this continent that we can't exploit right now.
We think that if you destroy the local biodiversity and things like that, they will never be able to be replaced because once those things are gone, there simply gone and we can't recover them and that since we don't know what their benefits might be, we should leave them for posterity.
We think it's important that future people have every bit as much of a claim to use antarctica as current people and that the most responsible way to use it, therefore, is to act as stewards rather than as miners or exploiters.
We all should we also think that it's important to avoid past mistakes.
At other times in history when people have discovered new continents or had technology open up previously inhospitable regions, the first thing that they've done is stolen everything they could and taken it back to the places where we already live.
We think that this has drastically damaged the ecosystem in places like alaska or the american west and that we should learn from those mistakes and not do the same thing in antarctica.
We should plan carefully how will interact with it and the best way to ensure that this happens is to treat it as a nature reserve in the meantime.
Our second point is about reducing conflict.
So recognize that right now it's really unclear who antarctica belongs to and what part of antarctica belongs to what countries.
There is a group of very complex and conflicting international claims to different parts of the continent.
Argentina, chile, britain, norway, the US, russia, all claim different parts of antarctica for their own and many times these conflicts or claims overlap.
We think that as oil and other minerals are discovered in antarctica, there's likely to be a lot of conflict.
Up to the early twenty-first century there wasn't conflict over antarctica because it was basically worthless ice and it was only claimed because it was convenient to do so.
But if there's suddenly hundreds of billions of dollars worth of oil, hypothetically, discovered then we think countries are going to go to war, potentially, over that resource especially as mineral resources become more scarce in more easily accessible locations.
Without limitations and treaties and plans about how to deal with antarctica, rudimentary steps have been taken in this direction but enough we think.
Without these steps, we think that ultimately you are more likely to have conflict in the future and antarctica will simply go to the strongest rather than be allocated fairly.
So I think that on our side, what we promote is a world in which countries should be able to share equally in the bounty of antarctica, rather than have strongest countries take everything for themselves our last claim is about urgency.
We think that antarctica is becoming more and more accessible due to global climate change and rising temperatures and due to increases in technology.
So recognize that right now most of the continent is hidden under an ice cap but it seems that in the next couple hundred years the ice cap is going to melt and all of that land will suddenly be exposed to the surface for the first time in thousands of years.
We think that it will be very easy for countries at that time to exploit resources that right now are very inaccessible.
We also think there will be great demand for easy to use resources at that time since places like the US and russia by that time we'll have had many of their resources exhausted.
We think, therefore, that it is urgent to deal with the problem of antarctica right now before it is possible to access the resources.
Once people are already mining or drilling on the continent, we don't think it's going to be easy to make them stop and we don't think it would be just to overturn existing property claims.
We need to act before those claims are actually state.
If the ice caps are going to melt, we need to have plans to deal with this in place and on our side we think that the best way to do that is to promote international cooperation and to prevent exploitation of these resources until some sort of plan is in place.
So for these reasons we think it's clear that we should protect the antarctic continent.
Thank you."
"Single-sex schools bring more harm than good because they're an incredibly valuable resource for empowering women.
They empower women, firstly, by creating academic role models, symbolic role models and just generally being icons of the achievements of women.
And secondarily, they also work more directly in empowering women in society and in their classrooms.
So, before we get into those arguments, let's talk about how we actually look at this context thing.
Obviously we're going to defend that single-sex schools bring more good than harm.
However, this does not necessarily mean that this should be exclusively one system or the other.
We think that it's important to have a hybrid of both systems and that individual women should choose to go to have the ability to choose to go to single-sex schools if they feel that that is a a better fit for them.
So, first let's talk about symbols and role models.
It's obvious that oftentimes when you look at a single-sex school, schools like wellesley or smith or mount holyoke, you look at schools that produce powerful female role models.
For example, hillary clinton was is an alumni of of wellesley.
And this is very important because when you have a powerful female academic, powerful female businesspeople, lawyers, politicians, that are able to thrive as a result of these environments they came from, this is very important for inspiring and encouraging women to actually get involved in certain things.
Because oftentimes women are told by society that certain occupations are not necessarily for them, that they should be pushed away from certain things, whether it's like stem research or or politics or things like that.
It's very important to make sure you have female role models so that women feel more comfortable and empowered so they can go into these fields.
But additionally, it's also important that you look at what these school what single-sex schools produce us as academic work.
Because when you look at feminism as an ideology, a whole lot of the contributions to the field, scholarly contributions to the field and also practical contributions to the field, such as like organizing people who are involved in organizing, people who are involved in like fundraising or operations or outreach, things like that, a lot of these people oftentimes come from single-sex schools, and a lot of work for advancing feminism comes out of single-sex schools.
So it's very important to make sure that we're that we are empowering this progress to continue because feminism is quite an important thing that we need to make sure that we keep defending.
This is also additionally important this entire symbolic context, because symbols are incredibly important in society.
When you think about the confederate flag in the united states, for example.
As a symbol it doesn't harm any it doesn't exactly cause like physical harm to people.
But as a symbol it's important because it's a representation of the continued oppression of african americans in society.
This is in many ways similar for single-sex schools because while even if we're not able to show that they achieve like a practical or tangible support, although I already think that we have done so, they're immensely important for the symbolic aspects of the way in which they empower women.
So, next, let's talk about some of the ways in which single-sex schools directly empower women.
There is a concept that's oftentimes called the confidence gap, in which women feel less confident or comfortable expressing a lot of their opinions, particularly when they're in the presence of men who are often times much more comfortable expressing their opinions.
So in order to combat this, single-sex schools can oftentimes be a very good solution to this problem.
Because in single-sex classrooms, when you have all women, you're going to have women that are going to be feeling more comfortable contributing in class, contributing work, and all of those kinds of things are gonna be good.
But additionally, it's also important to recognize that single-sex classrooms and schools are more likely to be less biased against women because when you look at women's academic achievements and performance in comparison to women, especially when it can come to like presentations or speaking or competitive spots on a team or things like that, oftentimes women are more likely to get their contributions are more likely to get undervalued, and this is something that's less likely to happen when they come from a single-sex school.
And all of this in turn makes it more likely that women will be high-achieving and therefore more likely to achieve later in life, which ultimately corrects a lot of systemic imbalance in society.
So for all of those reasons, single-sex schools do more harm than good."
"We think the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were justified and they were justified for three main reasons.
One, that the japanese were ultimately instigators of the conflict in the first place.
Two, there were no reasonably a reasonable alternative courses of action.
And three, that ultimately this would achieve benefits in the long run by accomplishing future deterrence.
So, let's start with japanese instigation.
Obviously, the japanese initiated a war against the united states by attacking pearl harbor.
So, why is this important?
The reason is that the united states was now necessarily entered into a war against japan and it had to fight japan.
And this is important because when it chose to attack hiroshima and nagasaki, those targets were picked as ultimately more industrialized and productive cities.
So by attacking those cities, they ultimately eliminated their ability to eliminated their ability to have more productive power, which hurt japan's military capacity.
But it also hurt the morale of japan in a very unique way, which ultimately was more likely to contribute to a war in which america did not start in the first place, but was forced to confront otherwise.
But additionally, I don't ultimately think that you can even really assign moral harm here, because there are no real alternatives.
Why is this true?
Because recognize that an invasion would not only be costly, but would likely accomplish the exact same in terms of civilian casualties as as well.
So when you look at the cost that this would have on american lives, this is something that we simply can't understate.
The soldiers that would be dying, possibly in the tens of thousands, each individual one of them is an american life, someone who probably has a family back home, or at the very least a whole future of their life to live.
This is what america has an obligation to protect, and if they can make a decision that would save countless american lives, they should definitely do that, and they should especially do that if there's no even real guarantee that there's going to be a difference in civilian casualties.
This is true because if it weren't for the unique terrorizing nature of the nuclear bombs, it's possible that a prolonged military occupancy would have been necessary, and essentially a US conquest of the entire continent piece by piece.
That would have required fire bombings of cities, fire bombings of plants across the area of where workers were, there would have been widespread damage anyway.
These are all casualties that would have likely arisen anyway, there likely would have been rebellions and uprisings, all things that would have resulted in a whole lot of damage and harms as well.
But, we finally want to talk about the future deterrence effect that this has, because I think that this is incredibly important as well.
And I think that this is important because the use of nuclear weapons made it more likely that you're not going to see nuclear weapons used in the future.
And I think this is true because of the way human beings think, and the way human beings act.
They're visually they're visual thinkers and they when they see something that is visually powerful, something like a tragedy that fold before their eyes, or something that has tremendous human casualty, things like with the radiation and the likes of the bomb.
I think that what this ultimately accomplishes is a much more powerful aversion to that.
So this is why when you just hear statistics about tens of thousands of deaths in a place like syria, that's ultimately a lot less powerful than looking at actual pictures of the carnage that you see there.
You're because because what it does is it evokes a base human instinct a base human emotional connection.
So I think this is incredibly important, because obviously there was a whole lot of devastation and damage from the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki.
What I ultimately think this led to though, is more of a human aversion to nuclear of nuclear weapons, and I think this is one of the big reasons why we haven't seen anyone actually be willing to use a nuclear weapon.
So at the end of the day this could've actually saved a whole lot more lives and made the world a whole lot more stable in the long run.
So for all of those reasons, I think it's quite clear the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were justified."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of today's motion, that we should ban lotteries.
The model here is pretty intuitive: we would just say that governments ought not, even at the state and local levels, have any sort of government sanctioned lottery.
Given that the scope of the info slide specifically regards state run lotteries, I think it is completely fair to say that we are fine with private lotteries, and things like casinos continuing onward, we would just say that government sponsored lotteries are a bad thing, and should be abolished.
So, three independent points of analysis under this: first, we would say that this facilitates gambling addictions, and that that's a bad thing.
Second, we would say that there is a disparate impact on poor individuals in the society.
And third, we would say it is a bad form of revenue raising for the government.
So, first argument, that it facilitates gambling addiction.
I think it's pretty intuitive as to why this is true, right?
Like, you have like not just a large pot to be won, so like people with the most significant incentive to gamble, in the most serious addictions, are going to be drawn to this pool, insofar as it is like the biggest shiniest pool, you have a multi billion, or multimillion dollar pool sometimes, that are extremely attractive, and because of just the scale of the lottery, you're always going to beat out whatever the private casino or whatever might promise, but we would say that, that is problematic right?
Addiction itself is a bad thing, we don't want to facilitate addiction, but we also think that when the state becomes involved in the gambling industry, and becomes a significant actor, that has a financial stake in ensuring that these people these likes quote unquote whales keep coming back to use the gambling services, that's when you like, erode at the actual state infrastructure, that is designed to help these people that are in need.
The state now has a financial incentive to overlook its moral obligation to assist those that are suffering from severe gambling addictions.
Likewise community members, that are profiting off of these lotteries, like shop owners, also have an incentive to turn a blind eye.
So, we think it is necessarily problematic, then, when you create a structure, that uniquely puts the state in a position to overlook this extreme form of suffering.
My second independent point, that poor people are disparately harmed by the lottery is also fairly intuitive.
Rich people don't need to gamble, because gambling is something that, generally speaking, people start doing because they believe that it will get them to riches.
These are generally people that are the most destitute within society, that have the least to lose, and as a result, are the most likely to engage in what is an inherently irrational behavior.
Lotteries are built on the assumption that they will bring in more money than they will put out, that is to say, that your probability of winning is significantly low enough, sufficiently low enough, that that would dilute out the expected winnings, weighed against your percentage probability of winning the lottery.
So it is an a rational behavior, that is generally fueled by a need to rise up in society, that is not felt by those that are already doing well.
So, we would say this is a bad policy, or this is a bad thing to have at the status quo, because it perpetuates the inequality that is systemic to lotteries.
My third independent point is that this is a bad way to raise revenue.
So, we would say that, generally, the argument that side government is going to make is something to the effect of like: but we increased state coffers, we put this money towards like education, or welfare, or whatever thing that the government does that you enjoy.
The problem with this is that presumably, the services that you think we really need, that are historically underfunded, are the ones that go to the poor.
Things like funding for homeless programs, or funding for job training, or welfare, or whatever, right?
But the problem is that, at the point where you're taking the money from the people that are worse off in society, this reasoning doesn't make sense.
It's a regressive tax, because you're just taking from the poor, and then giving some of that money back to the poor people, that needed it the first place.
We would say that this is inherently irrational way of raising the money, that is necessary to provide these important social services.
Proud to propose."
"We should ban human cloning because it's not safe and that's really big problem when you're talking about human lives and it's also a threat to humanity in a broader sense, in a macro sense.
So let's start by talking about why cloning is so unsafe.
And the thing about dolly the sheep that was in that's interesting besides the fact that it dolly exists in the first place, is that dolly died after a couple of months of like some kind of disease like dolly didn't last very long and a lot of cloned animals do not last very long and the reason is that because despite the progress that's being made in testing, to some extent, it's still very imperfect when you're talking about cloning another human another another species in its totality.
And if we can't really do it with a lot of animals in perfect way then we definitely shouldn't be risking with humans because unlike when you're cloning an an animal like if you clone a lamb and the lamb maybe fifty percent of the sheep live and fifty percent of them die and that's okay when you're talking about sheep.
But when you're talking about human beings these things have huge consequences and if you bring a being into this world and it dies a couple of like years later or a couple of months later, even of some kind of weird cancer or some kind of strange disease, then you've basically caused suffering to a living sentient being and that's obviously something that's like really, really a big problem.
Not something that you can underemphasize in the same way in which like we wouldn't deem it moral to like essentially like inject some kind of disease into a regularly birthed child that makes him more likely to have problems it's really not fair to do it in cloning because you're basically just doing a procedure to create a child that is more likely to be dangerous.
So that's like a big problem.
But the next thing is that it's also a threat to humanity in a broader sense in a couple of ways.
So while it's tricky to look at this in the short term because things like evolution happen over a macro sense, a lot of ways this undermines the basis of life in that the reason why human beings exist is because of evolution.
Human beings exist because they evolved a lot of good traits, like opposable thumbs, like having good brains, things like that that like are things that you evolve over time.
They don't happen at once.
And cloning essentially eliminates the ability to actually have evolution because when you're just cloning something you're creating something that's absolutely identical.
That's like that's why like with asexual reproduction you don't really get like a whole lot of a difference there cause you're creating exact identical copies.
But when you're talking about like natural mating, the crossing of two different species, you create more of an opportunity for evolution to happen, for mutations to happen, because you're not allowing a simple clone to exist.
But beyond that I also think that this has impacts for the importance of genetic diversity cause especially when there's like a risk of like like we see this with crop failures, where when every crop is of the exact same species and some kind of disease comes in, all of the crop dies because there's no genetic diversity and that's like one of the big reasons why genetic diversity is important.
It makes a species as a whole strong.
So like in a time where there is like risk of like bioengineered like bio weapons maybe or like accidental release of like a mutated diseases or things like that having like genetic diversity in a human population is like a pretty important thing.
But the final thing is that it's not really necessary to have human cloning in this sense because alternatives are sufficient.
Therapeutic cloning is fine if you want to clone a lung, if you want to clone a liver, something then that's fine you can do that, that's different.
And also you can just have organ donors, you can have in vitro fertilization, there's like there's a lot of alternatives to reproduction besides cloning that people can use if they can't reproduce naturally.
So for all those reasons we should keep banning cloning."
"Prenatal diagnosis does more good than harm for two big reasons.
First, it's better for the parents, and second, it's better for the possible future child in the long run.
So first, why is it better for the parents.
As far as financial costs are concerned, there is incredibly exorbitant ones oftentimes, and the reason for this is because people who have diseases or disabilities often require two things: they require specialized care and accommodations, and they require medical treatment.
Both of these things cost money.
In fact, both of these things often cost quite a bit of money.
For disabilities and diseases, especially ones that are less common, these can often have incredibly high healthcare costs, especially in places like the united states.
And additionally, oftentimes getting care or assistance, getting special equipment to deal with somebody, or getting a special person to watch over somebody who's qualified to look after somebody with disabilities, these can also be incredibly hefty expenses, expenses that first, a lot of people can't afford at all, and secondarily, it's also can be an expense that people just aren't prepared to invest, because people have the choice to make that that's a choice people can make with their lives, if they think that spending that much money and that much time is worth it.
And the next thing is the emotional costs that are put on parents.
Because it's important to consider that parents are real people, that they're not these infallible human beings that we should thrust moral obligations on too lightly.
They're regular people and while we should celebrate many parents who would be willing to give all of the love, care and support to somebody with disease and disabilities, a lot of parents simply just aren't the right kind of people to put that emotional energy into it, and simply will just feel drained and upset the possibly while doing that.
And we think that that's a legitimate thing that people should be concerned about.
If they simply do not think that they are the right kind of person that they can burden themselves with having to care for somebody, oftentimes possibly throughout their entire lives they might have to care for this person, that could be a burden that they're just not prepared to take, and it could be incredibly draining.
That's an important consideration, and therefore something that can be prevented by prenatal diagnosis.
But the next thing that I want to talk about is the impact this has on kids.
Because the problem is that oftentimes, existing in our society with a disability can be incredibly debilitating for you.
Oftentimes there's bullying and teasing towards people who look different or act differently, because they're because kids can just be mean or they don't have an understanding of what people's conditions often are, but additionally it can oftentimes be difficult in our society to find accommodations that are helpful.
It could be difficult to get the right education with if you have a learning disability.
It could be difficult to do things like walk upstairs sometimes if there's no elevator present.
There's a whole lot of things in society that just make it more difficult for you to exist in a lot of ways.
So I think that this could have a couple of pretty major impacts.
The first of which is that with especially with regards to the bullying and the teasing, you may feel this may increase your likelihood of mental illness, depression, a whole lot of other things there.
It could also oftentimes lead to social alienation or not being able to have as many friends.
But this also means that you're going to have your job and career prospects severely hurt, not for any fault of your own, but because we simply don't exist in a society that is prepared to accommodate, which is rather unfortunate but a sad truth.
Look, here is.
And the final thing that I want to talk about is the actual moral costs that this that this is accumulating, as a harm to conflict to what this could be.
Because obviously there are harms that are extant here.
But the problem is that we're not murdering anybody, I don't actually think that there's any real moral cost here, because I would say as a good standard as for whether or not you're actually accumulating a moral harm, it would would be the sentience of an actual actor, the the average sentience of a human being.
And since they're so young, it's the point of which they're not able to have any kind of sensory inputs at all, they can't eat, think, breathe, really do anything, I don't actually think that it's really even worthwhile considering someone at this such early stage of development as actually viable.
And therefore there's no real actual moral harm in possibly aborting this fetus during after the results of prenatal diagnosis.
And it's for all of those reasons we're incredibly proud to propose."
"National service in the united states should be mandatory.
We think the model in this debate is quite simple.
We'd say the united states should adopt a similar method of conscription that exists in places like israel and south korea, in which all citizens are required to serve up to two years in the army or in or in public service, national service.
And this doesn't mean people are being forced to fight in combat roles per se, but it means that they have to go through army training, that they need to be indoctrinated through the same system as everyone else, and they're put in fields in which they can best specialize and be of use to the national service.
Okay, two reasons why we should have mandatory service.
Firstly is a quality of obligation.
Recognize that in the status quo, there's a massive disparity in national service in which minority and poor individuals are constantly coerced by the by the united states military and other national service sectors to join their ranks.
The reason for this is that with the rise of higher education and competitive job opportunities outside of national service, and the fact that the united states army and other national service bodies have been increasingly seen in negative lights due to recent wars in iraq and afghanistan, we think that individuals educated individuals and individuals that have other opportunities are much more likely to not join the army.
But furthermore, recruitment for the army and for other types of national service are overtly directed towards poor and minority communities.
There's an active effort by the united states to recruit from these communities, because they can offer things like future employment benefits, they can offer things like opportunity for advancement in educational benefits, that make these jobs look alluring but in reality, end up putting these people on the front lines.
Defense is a collective responsibility.
We are all equally responsible for the defense of our nation.
We should all have to face the burden of defense because it is something that benefits every person.
While maybe we pay taxes into allowing the army to exist, there's a clearly a disparity not a burden that individuals are being forced to face, especially given that people have overwhelmingly been joining national service, because of the impoverished and because of the discriminatory backgrounds that they face.
We think you shouldn't coerce the few to serve the whole.
If we had conscription on a national level, it would ensure that these coercive measures that currently exist would be expunged.
It wouldn't be necessary, and it would mean that there is an equality of of service required amongst all people for an equal benefit that we all gave.
We also think that , secondly, mandatory national service would increase concern for how we use the military.
We think that when more people are forced to serve, this means that more people have a direct connection to the military.
Whether this means that you have a brother who's serving the military or a father or a son or a family member or a friend, it means that everyone has some sort of connection to the military service.
This means that when it comes to how we're going to use that military, people are now deeply invested in it because they know that choosing to send soldiers to a war in iraq or afghanistan means that their own children, their own friends and family, could be the ones that are fighting on the front line, rather than the nebulous other that composes the military for many privileged groups in the status quo.
When this happens, we think that it's much more difficult for the military industrial complex to push the united states into wars because there'd be more political advocacy against things like unjust wars, things like going into wars without enough information, which is what happened in iraq and in afghanistan, and we think that more restraint on the military overall would be likely.
It also meant that when we went in to conflict, there would be a concern for ensuring that the conflict lasted as little time as possible and had as little casualties as possible, because there would be immense public backlash if suddenly droves of citizens were dying under the united states wash, and no matter whether you are poor or rich or white or black, your son or daughter could be the one that is facing those circumstances.
When people are invested in the military, the military is used better, and when all people contribute to the military, the few the few do not need to be coerced.
And for these reasons, national service in the united states should be mandatory."
"We should ban live exports.
Three main arguments, first on animal cruelty.
Recognize that live exports oftentimes come at massive cost to the livelihood and the essential like security of the animal that you're transporting.
These animals are kept in creates with no space for weeks as they are being transported across the ocean or over air.
When they are in these crates, they have no ability to use their muscles and they often times have very little food so many of them will actually die in the process.
You end up with mass amounts of muscle atrophy and pain.
This is just like the definition of suffering, right?
Like everything that is natural about an animal is to be outside to have space to run around to be free, and when you have live animal transport and export you go against all of those natural impetuses and you just create the least comfortable situation possible.
So even if you don't think that animals have that many rights or are equal to humans, it is definitely the case that animals shouldn't have to suffer unnecessarily for human desires.
Like there is no difference between the pain that an animal feels and the pain of that the human feels even if the animal has a smaller brain.
Like that's an arbitrary difference because suffering has to do with your motor neurons and your sensory neurons and those are things that both species just experience completely the same.
This is just a classic situation of higher order pain versus lower order pleasure.
We just don't think it's worth the trade-off to make animals suffer so much so that we make it marginally more convenient for a couple of humans, given that those humans are going to be fine either way.
Our second argument is that there is a lack of necessity.
We just don't understand why you can't just send dead meat instead.
Like they are already specimens of most domesticated and farm animal breeds on different continents so they have the ability to breed on those continents already.
There's no reason that they should be sending live animals except some marginal amount of convenience or money, but this just doesn't outweigh all of the reasons I'm telling you it's bad, right?
Like we also just think that a lot of the times you use live export to cover up smuggling because you are able to hide so much when you're able to just have these like untransparent crates with live things inside of them.
This includes things like drugs, you can smuggle like people in sex trafficking because you have the body heat and smell of the animals and and the crates to disguise these criminal goods.
And sure we like don't think that banning live exports will completely abolish these illicit dealings, but we do think that it'll make it significantly more difficult to accomplish them and make it a lot cheaper to catch them because it's also really hard to investigate and kinda like go in and look around these kinds of live export situations.
So we think that making it more difficult to smuggle and stopping those other forms of smuggling is something that we're definitely a fan of.
Our third arguments about the environment.
First recognize that animals are a vector for disease and it's really hard to track or like completely prevent these things from spreading because you can have in asymptomatic animal that is carrying a certain virus or a certain bacteria.
And even if you like go through the animal's fur to see if it's carrying any parasites that's not something unnecessarily fine and spores are really tiny.
So this is just like a very high risk activity.
That means you can transfer bacteria and viruses from continent to continent in ways that it could never have been done before.
And this is what allows like some species that might be fine in north america then become really parasitic and really bad in other countries.
Like there are some like grasses and some mushrooms that have done this before and like you can infect the soil or the people in those other nations.
And we just think that the fact that that risk can have such large impacts is always going to outweigh the marginal benefits of being able to have live exports.
Like we just think that protecting those people is more important.
Proud to propose."
"Recall elections are beneficial.
So, by this we mean a system in which, let's say you had the governor of a US state, and that person was doing a poor job and citizens wanted to recall them.
They would first have a referendum that would work like a normal referendum in order to determine if they wanted to recall the governor, and then if they voted to recall him, they would replace him using whatever technique they would normally use to fill an empty seat, so maybe, the lieutenant governor would become the new governor, or maybe they would have a gubernatorial election in that state.
So, we think that, broadly speaking, it would be as similar as possible to the current system but adding a way for people to recall governors, members of parliament, and other government officials who are elected in the status quo.
And we would like to see this apply to all elected officials.
So, our first argument is about accountability.
We think that a huge problem right now is that the interests of politicians are not aligned with the interests of their constituents.
It's very easy for a politician to tell lies on the campaign trail, and say that they're going to do x, y and z as soon as they get into office, and then turn around and do something completely different because they're not held very accountable.
If elections are five years apart like they are in britain for members of parliament, or six years apart, like for american senators, most people probably can't remember what the issues were that the person ran on in the first place when they were first elected, so people aren't held accountable, or the political sphere has changed so much that those are no longer relevant and they're not held accountable.
We think that, furthermore politicians are able to get away with a lot of abuse that you couldn't get away with in the private sector.
Things like, british members of parliament taking advantage of their expense accounts for unofficial businesses, or poor job performance even many, mps don't show up for votes, many american senators also don't show up for votes, many governors don't bother to try to pass laws, and ultimately they don't do the things that they're supposed to do.
You would get fired from a regular job if you didn't do what you were meant to do.
So we think that there should be a similar mechanism to be sure the politicians actually care, and that in this way you align their interest to those of voters because the only way for them to get job security is to do what's good for the voters or what voters want from them so now they have the same interests.
Our second argument is about political engagement.
We think that right now, there's not a lot of reason to stay informed for most people in non-election years.
So if your country has parliamentary elections every five years, people probably follow the news much more closely in an election year and then, become less and less invested in the off years.
But if you know that there's a potential that you can punish politicians for their wrong doings, we think you have more of an incentive to stay informed, and more of a reason to actually care about what's going on day to day even if a lot of it seems kind of abstract from your everyday life.
We think also that people will feel more control over the political process and that this is a good thing.
If people feel, in other words, like they matter as a citizen and like they have the ability to change things, then they're more likely to have faith in the government, and more likely to want to participate in things like off year elections and referenda.
We tell you that we do this by having recall elections because it's very obvious how you affect the government if you're able to take people out of government for doing a poor job.
A lot of the things that people are asked to do to participate in government are sort of abstract.
You vote to fund something or you vote to allow someone to do something in parliament, but you don't have a lot of direct control over the people who represent you.
We give you that kind of direct control and we think that this will make people feel more invested in their government.
Lastly, we think that you get a better politician citizen dialogue, so there's not a ton of reason why you're not campaigning for reelection for a politician to spend much time with their constituents, hearing about their concerns, and representing their interests.
We think that you're a lot more likely to try to have a good relationship with your constituents and to spend a lot of time there rather than in the capital if you know that they can recall you if they're unhappy with the job that you're doing.
So we think that there actually is more accountability for this reason also, and that this leads to more engagement between these elite politicians and everyday ordinary people.
Who would be voting in a recall election.
So we think recall elections are beneficial because they lead to more accountability and better political engagement.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should subsidize higher education.
We mean by this is that we would start by making all public colleges completely free while simultaneously massively raising the governmental aid that comes through the form of need-based scholarships for those who might have gotten into more prestigious private universities.
Two main areas of clash, the first on education as a facilitative right.
We think that there are current that there are basic rights that everyone tends to agree on.
The right to live a free life, the right to have access like equal access at the beginning to certain opportunities, like the right to live but all of these rights are individually facilitated by other things and we think that blocking your ability to access those other things are synonymous with blocking your ability to get to those very basic human rights that everybody agrees upon.
We think education is one of those jobs insofar as it becomes it has become more and more difficult to access a basic standard of living and basic opportunities if you do not have a higher education in the status quo.
We think we see this with the automatisation of more blue collar jobs as well as with like the general air of nonchalance that people have to the approach of like a living minimum wage.
As such we think that part of the government's job is to make sure that people have the equal tools to self actualize and participate in society and access those basic rights, and because in the status quo education is simultaneously more necessary to different jobs where previously it wasn't and more expensive than it's ever been then it becomes the obligation of the government to make sure that people have access at least to the most basic form of higher education especially since without it it's often the case that people end up forced into poverty and we need to prevent there from being this like institutionalized barrier to being able to access it.
Like we think at the end of the day people should be able to have equal access to choose between different opportunities even if not equal access to those opportunities at the same time and we think the only way in which someone can meaningfully choose to work a job that doesn't need education is if they have the ability to work one that does if they so desired.
Our second area of clashe is about how it's good for the united states on a few levels.
First, let's talk about how it's politically beneficial.
We think that generally people who are more educated tend to be more politically active.
This is for a few reasons.
First it's because they're taught to use their informational sources effectively.
We think that that part of the problem is that it's like surprisingly difficult to find non-biased news sources if you aren't someone who was been regularly exposed to like methods by which you find them when you were younger.
We also think it's because you're surrounded by people who facilitate you being politically knowledgeable like I'm a science major but I have plenty of friends who happen to be politics majors and because of them I recognize why it's important to be politically active.
But third we think it's just because at the end of the day working higher education jobs tends to be physically easier than working those that you can access without an education.
If I'm spending hours of my day on my feet because I work something basic like something that doesn't require an education whether it's working in the mines or working at mcdonald's this is physically a lot more exhausting than any kind of mental work that someone ought be doing.
Like you come home and you don't have the energy or the ability to keep yourselves up to par on everything else in the way that in the way that those who are more privileged with a job from a higher education do.
So we think that it generally leads to more democratic systems when you have more people who are politically active.
We also think it's beneficial for the economy insofar as if you have more people earning more and since it's more likely that you'll have people living above the minimum wage once you have more people educated, it means that you have more people buying stuff and paying taxes which is good for the economy but also less people relying on government services which means that the government can spend more on other things.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should legalize public nudity, for a few big reasons: first, because I think that banning public nudity is inherently immoral, because it restricts the way in which people are able to express themselves with their body, in a way in which doesn't really actually affect other people, and secondarily, because I think that it fosters a culture of body shaming, which leads to a lot of bad norms with regards to like, mental health, but also stigma as far like safety for the body, things like that.
So, let's start by talking about the immoral nature.
I think that generally, if you want to live in a liberal society, that is accepting of individual lifestyles, the ideal that we should focus on is, as long as it doesn't actually hurt other people, and as long as, if there is some kind of perceived harm to other people, that harm is actually legitimate, then you should defer to allowing people to express themselves in the individual ways in which they choose.
And that's important, because individual ways in which people express themselves are like a very like inseparable part of their identity.
It's a very important part of like well being and identity.
So, these things are very important.
So, now let's talk about why there's nothing wrong with public nudity, and about why any perceived harm for this are just an illusion.
Because, recognize that, this is in many ways a distinctly western, the like the idea of banning public nudity, is distinctly western concept, and at that, not only a western concept, but a very religiously rooted in like, judeo, christian, islamic values.
What do I mean by this?
If you go to like some places in africa, you're going to see that it's very common that, people dress with little to no clothing, and that there's a lot of like body painting that exists, and like other kinds of body art, and things like that, and that, this is the way in which people express themselves, as opposed to just like wearing clothing and covering up.
So, I think it's important to recognize that, all of this is contextualized based on the culture that you live, and the culture that you grew up in.
Most people in western society, from the day that they were born, had clothes put on them, and were told every day: you need to wear clothes, you can't just go outside naked, you can't put your body out this way.
And over time, obviously this becomes a very powerful part of your identity, it becomes like a very powerful notion of shame, but, that doesn't actually mean that it's valid, and it doesn't mean that it's correct.
So, if people want to not wear clothing, they should have the right to do that.
The fact that it may offend somebody, that you're not wearing clothing, shouldn't actually matter.
It doesn't actually hurt you, it only hurts you in like a perceptual sense, because you grew up with a certain expectation or lifestyles.
But, that's no different than like someone being gay, and having a like a gay wedding hurts you.
It hurts you in like the ethereal sense, because it goes up against the values that you grew up with, but it doesn't actually lead to any like harm to you in and of itself.
So, that's why I think it's like a very very important, on like a principal level, to make sure that you allow people to go into the public in the nude, if they want to, and that this is actually very problematic notions.
But, I also want to talk about body shaming and stigmas, because I think that that's important too.
So recognize that, when you're brought up, from the day that you're born, in a culture that emphasizes a need to cover up your body, a couple of things happen.
First and foremost, you're going to there's going to be a lot more stigma with issues related to the body and your sexuality.
You're going to be much less likely to have sexual education, you're going to be much more likely to do like less safe things to your body, because there's like a social pressure and stigma against having open discussion about the body, and against open discussion with relation to sexuality, because like, that's the root of not wanting public nudity.
It's like a fear of sexuality of humanity.
So all of these things do lead to like more of a prevalence of unsafe sex, more of a prevalence of unsafe pregnancies or STI, all these things.
I also think that, secondarily though, there's problematic mental health issues, that are associated with this too.
And that's because, from the day that you're born, you're constantly questioning your body, constantly told to, like, shame your body, to cover up your body, which is, in a lot of ways, unhealthy.
It's not something that's natural, and it's not something that we should be doing.
So for all those reasons, very proud to legalize public nudity."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should subsidize public service broadcasters.
Two independent points.
The first is that public service broadcasters provide a public good.
I think this happens in a lot of different ways.
The first is just information.
So there are news organizations that operate in the public sector.
There's a lot of you know very good journalism coming out of you know national public radio institutions like that, and I think the fundamental reason for that is that they're not beholden to a financial interest you know whereas something like fox news or MSN BC has a financial incentive to you know skew their news in a particular way in order to secure a certain client base public radio doesn't really have that incentive.
They have the capacity to be oh you know pretty hard-hitting and you know be pretty frank and unbiased in their reporting by virtue of the fact that they're you know not looking to secure a certain fan base or anything like that.
There are certainly going to be like allegations of course that they're left-leaning.
That's probably true that they're broadly left-leaning but I think the reason for that has more to do with I mean quite frankly the nature the facts of what they're reporting on that you know just a lot of the issues that are currently relevant lean left when you look at them through a factual analysis something like healthcare which is pretty objective that republicans are botching.
Something like you know right structures like right and things like that which is you know clearly you have just like the left on the right side of history and I think that's the product of where you know public radio's bias comes from but not a real bias but we're just biased towards factual analysis.
The second justification for why public radio has a public good is the educational component and I think this is a lot more objective is it is things like for example mister roger's neighborhood back in the nineties but you know more modern day something like sesame street has a really serious educational value to it.
This ranges from you know really simple things like teaching kids you know spelling and counting and things like that all the way to like really big picture lessons like sesame street will quite often have segments about you know you know mental health stigma or disabilities or things like that, things that children might not often get access to in school certainly because schools are much more focused on academic things but also through parents because a lot of the time you know you need this education coming from someone that's a professional in what they're doing teaching about mental health stigma from a parent you can certainly attempt that but I think you're just always going to get a much better lesson out of someone that's an actual professional in the mental health field and public service rate public broadcasting enables that education to come straight into someone's home from a professional's mouth at you know of course no expense to the family.
And lastly I think there's a public good provided by the fact that public broadcasting can experiment more.
This is getting back to the financial interest really, is that you have more room to innovate in the public sector in this which is a bit counterintuitive but because you're not beholden to you know a particular fan base and you're not looking to secure a specific audience, you have the freedom to innovate and you have the freedom to really push the boundaries.
I think there's a lot of radio programs out right now that demonstrate that, things like s-town for example and it's it's valuable when you have that innovation both from an entertainment perspective but also from an educational and information standpoint.
Our second independent, briefly, is just that public radio broadcasting broadly can't survive without these subsidies.
This isn't a profitable endeavor.
This is something that actually you know is able to provide these things because it doesn't have a financial incentive.
It specifically targets people that cannot pay for these services and at that point then it's important to ensure that sort of public sector or governmental support for the programs because without that support you don't get these benefits.
There isn't an alternative policy that solves for this, there isn't alternative way to get these types of benefits this is it and I think that justifies a subsidy.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should introduce a carbon tax.
I think we are placing this in the united states and we're going to apply this carbon tax on all corporations, and it would scale with the amount of carbon that you omit, so those that are less carbon-producing would pay less money on this tax and those who are more carbon-producing would would take would have more.
In addition to this, we would say that we would invest all of the resulting funds into fighting global warming and global warming outreach and education.
With that, two independent points: first, on creating an incentive for corporations to change their environmentally unfriendly behavior.
Recognize that currently there's an economically it is economically preferable to be awful to the environment insofar as this means you get to use cheaper labor and cheaper materials, and a lot of the infrastructure that already exists in the status quo is in the most environmentally damaging way that would have to be then replaced.
So like smoke stacks that have filters on top or massively a creation of the current time period.
So any kind of buildings or factories that were built before then necessarily don't have this technology, but also this technology is more expensive just by virtue of the extra work that had to be put into it.
What we think a carbon tax does is it stops making it economically preferable to have to not follow good environmental standards or take care of the environment because it costs money now.
It incentivizes a decrease in carbon emissions that doesn't currently exist.
It's also important because corporations, factories, are some of the biggest structural polluters there.
We think that changing individual behaviors is always going to be marginal by comparison to changing the behaviors of the hundreds of large corporations and factories that exist in the status quo insofar as even one of those make up the pollution of over a hundred individual people.
So we think in terms of best policy action, it's always going to be preferable to target corporations rather than to target the individual consumer and individually environmentally unfriendly person.
If we want to stop global warming, you need to stop individual corporations from propagating it.
And also, I think it's important to note exactly how bad global warming is.
It destroys coastlines as the sea level rises, which sucks up entire cities and villages, killing people and displacing them into other areas that then become more and more overpopulated.
It changes the weather in areas so that the crops that usually grew there can no longer do so.
It makes it so that there are more diseases as areas that previously were much colder heat up, and suddenly malaria can survive there.
And it like also destroys livestock that like previously could exist in that area but no longer can adapt to the to the surrounding temperature and weather.
It also just like, besides these kinds of like very bad impacts in the short term, recognize that global warming's a terminal impact insofar as it leads to the literal heat death of the universe.
This is something we think you ought prevent insofar as it destroys all of humanity as well as all of the animals, etcetera, that live on the earth.
We'd prefer a world in which that didn't happen.
Our second area of clash is about encouraging green technology innovation.
Once there is a real demand, that's when people are capable of producing and innovating at their top peak and selling it for the cheapest amount possible.
We think currently the demand for green energy technology exists only on small-stick operations and smaller groups that are take it upon themselves to be environmentally friendly, but insofar as the vast majority of corporations and individuals still don't care, we don't have enough demand to make this matter.
We think the only time that you get enough demand is when you make corporations care enough to create it, and we need that to occur in order to stimulate the innovation that will make it cheaper later for smaller corporations or school buildings or individual people to adopt that technology to themselves.
We also think you just end up with creating more efficient technology insofar as it inspires competition now that there's a demand to do so.
We think what happens in the status quo is that maybe one group makes this thing, but if no one really cares about it, then there's no incentive for other groups to make that thing better.
So we think it's actually quite good when you stimulate the economy and do all of these things that are like socially good by having a carbon tax.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban hate sites.
We mean by this is that the government would ban and take down any kind of website that promotes hate speech, racist speech or sexist speech, or anything that is like definite defined in like the legislature as hate speech.
Three main areas of clash, first on government signaling.
The way that the government lays the laws and then forms and then like enforces them forms individuals' behaviors into the long term.
A really good example of this is that although segregation was an incredibly unpopular policy government enforcement forced people to go along with it and change public opinion into the long term.
Like if you post a question now to the united states about whether or not segregation is good or bad the vast majority of them would say it's really bad eventhough like fifty years ago that wasn't the response.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, we saw that trump's election and racist policies allowed some of the most hateful displays of speech that we've ever had before.
Like for example the charleston riots were massively allowed to happen because they weren't afraid of anything being enforced against them because they knew that the current government was on their side and was willing to support for them and apologize for them.
If the government bans hate sites, it signals that that behavior is unacceptable and that's really important because it means that we'll see less of that behavior being exhibited.
People see it as more of a risk to say and do things according to like hatefull ways of thinking and so they don't do it as often.
It also signals to those targeted that the government is on their side that they can trust them which is also really important in building like long term solvency of like I'm willing to communicate with my government, I'm willing to report criminal activity, I'm willing to take an active part in voting, etcetera.
Like all of that happens when individuals feel connected to their governments.
Our second area of argumentation is about targeting recruitment because op will come up here and they're going to say that we're just pushing sites underground and we're fine with that.
We think that this is true that individuals are probably just going to go on a deep web and have these organizations there but we're fine with that because we're worried more about the accessibility of the sites since that's how people on the margins are going to get recruited.
Look, super duper racists are going to be super duper racists on both sides of the house.
That's just going to happen because we already see those people aren't groups that want their opinions changed or can have their opinions changed.
The question is if a dumb thirteen year old can get on to the sites and get brainwashed then do we see that as an acceptable thing that ought be promoted within society.
We think that that's exactly how young racist replenish the ranks of those who are dying off.
We think that like what happens is that they're able to easily access this kind of media like easily access people who believe in these kinds of things and the only way in which you stop that accessibility is by forcing these individuals out of the public sphere out of the public eye.
If they all die out or at least there are dramaticly less of them then that's a win.
Our third area of argumentation is about protecting individual rights.
It prevents people from having to see these sights because they accidentally clicked on a page or someone sent it to them which we think is actually a ridiculously common occurrence right like someone is targeted by like their peers because they're a person of color or something and so they get sent really hateful messages and like very hateful links and so we think that like on our side of the house you no longer have to be subjected to that which is actually really important because op is going to come up here and they're going to be like the right to free speech and they're going to talk about it but the right to free speech isn't absolute.
We see this with things like libel and slander where even though these are words that I'm saying it's not inherently my right to say them insofar as they harm other people.
We think that hate speech is really really similar because it harms other people, because it makes them feeling unsafe when they want to say something.
For all those reasons like we don't think that this is something that is like a valuable or protected way of like exhibiting your freedom of expression.
These sites cause violence a majority of the time also insofar as they are used to like make people feel more violent towards certain groups, they're used to gather and organize and all of these things are very real rights violations that far extended a violation of them being able to type this.
Proud to propose."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of today's motion that we should ban boxing.
Two independent points, but first the model.
Generally we would define boxing by a sniff test.
I think that you know this is something that's probably hard to pin down, what exactly constitutes boxing, especially when it's a sport that is practiced in many different ways, in many different countries.
But I think this is something that when you see it you kind of know what it is.
That is if someone is punching somebody else competitively we'll we'll call it boxing.
I think for all intents and purposes we're comfortable with that definition.
In terms of how we would ban it, you know we'd ban it the same way that we ban other organized sports that we deem unsavory, so like cock fighting, for example.
We just like institute like jail time or large fines on people who engage in it.
We would probably like punish the like participants differently from how we would like punish the like organizers would be punished more harshly than the participants.
So two independent points.
First is inflicted violence.
That is the violence that is in harms and suffering that are just intrinsic to the sport itself.
I think much in the way that we see cock fighting as something that is like cruel and inhumane to the animals that participate in it, boxing is something that inflicts serious damage upon the participants.
Generally speaking, we're looking at things like concussions, long term brain damage, obviously just like surface level things like lots of broken bones and weakness pertaining to that.
There is very clear, visible, and systemic suffering that is intrinsic to this sport.
The problem though, and this is where people will say there's like a difference between that and cock fighting, is that generally supporters of the sport will say, oh well people like are actually consenting into this, they agree to engage in boxing.
I think the problem is that this isn't an entirely consensual agreement.
This is true for two reasons: first, as an information asymmetry, that generally promoters will paint a rosy picture of what boxing looks like to their perspective participants in order to get them into playing.
We think this is coercive though.
That sort of selling somebody a false picture of what their future will look like if they're a boxer is something that we are generally not supportive of and, more importantly, something that we don't think constitutes meaningful consent on the part of the participant.
But secondly, it's targeted towards people towards poor people and minorities.
And the reason for this is because they are in such a desperate position in their lives that they're so bereft of alternative opportunities and normal passive employment and prosperity, that they have to resort to this sport that risks their lives in their future prospects.
This is a problem.
We don't think consent is meaningful when your surroundings and the society that you grew up in and your lack of opportunity force you into this thing that will almost objectively make your life worse.
I do want to stress that objectivity.
Because for every mike tyson out there, there are hundreds upon hundreds of boxers who failed at the sport, weren't good enough, and only walked away with blunt force trauma and lifelong concussions.
We don't think then this is like a meaningful path to prosperity.
We don't think the false dream that minorities and poor individuals are being sold is worth the trade offs.
Our second independent point is the normalized violence intrinsic to the sport.
So this is external to the actual participants.
People who view competitive boxing, I think, see this and they see it be as something that's like being endorsed by mainstream society because of its presence on TVs and in like large arenas like TD garden and they say, oh this is a thing that's normal.
This is a thing that is okay to glorify.
And as a result, you see like small children are really into boxing and like the violence that it endorses as a result of it.
And as a result become more violent themselves.
That obviously has sort of like trickle down effects onto society all the way from just like willingness to have schoolyard fights, all the way up to like not look not like batting an eye when like other people engage in acts of violence on the street, things like domestic violence.
We think this is a problem for society.
Proud to propose."
"We should limit the internet of things because the internet of things has it'll have an incredibly dangerous impact on our lives in a lot of ways if we don't have sensible regulation.
There's been a whole great deal of technological progress over the past couple of decades to the point where in a lot of ways the fabric of society in our culture is completely changing at a faster pace than ever before given the forces of technology and I think in a lot of ways we're not prepared for it at the start we want to I want to talk about cyber security because I think in a lot of ways the internet is incredibly unsafe and that a lot of your data is incredibly unsafe and the premier example of this is like throughout the past year there's been a a a great number of high profile hacking incidents whether it's like equifax getting hacked or other similar attacks that were employing the use of ransomware.
By and large these tools and tactics that were being used were as a result of literally the CIA getting hacked and CIA hacking tools getting released to basically the entire internet which kind of presents a problem when like in theory one of the most advanced hacking like public agencies in the world, like in theory the CIA probably has pretty good cyber security, if they can't even protect their own systems and the tools they use to attack like people and corporations and governments, then got released the entire internet that was a big part of why we went from seeing run of the mill hacking to more recently much more widespread hacking.
Obviously there's other high profile examples too like russia hacking.
Like the united states literally hacking US elections and hacking the emails of like political parties.
Horrible things that prove that the internet just is not secure and I think in a lot of ways the internet of things make that worse.
It is going to centralize your life into single locations so when all of these devices your car, your phone, your your refrigerator, are all connected into a single server you're the it's it's you're much more likely to be vulnerable because rather than having to break into each one of those individual things to get access to personal information, instead of having to break into your car and your house and your refrigerator and your phone they now only after break into like one centralized location.
I think in addition to that obviously just the greater number of things on the internet just creates more vulnerability so that's the second thing.
But third and foremost I also think that there is more likely going to be quality distinction from cyber security.
And this is like so it's like for example you could maybe look at like password like encryption on websites where like by and large if you like were to call like if I have my like I have a password with IBM and I call IBM customers support, I probably can't just be like hey I want you to reset my password for me because IBM will presumably say we don't have your password it comes it like it's encrypted and like we don't it's a security thing, we don't have access to these kinds of things.
But there's probably a good deal of websites maybe like shadier parts of the internet, especially if you're like not as informed about things, where maybe these things like are just like sitting around and this could be the same with various devices where there's going to be quality distinctions there's not gonna be necessarily quality common controls on these kind of things to make sure that it's going to be safe.
But the next thing is also just like an issue of like privacy and autonomy because besides all of those things, besides like hacking and things like that there's also a privacy risk in corporations.
Corporations being able to sell data on you, information on your identity on literally every aspect of your life what you eat, how you sleep, how you drive, how you walk.
Corporations can sell that to basically anyone who wants that information and that's important because that's can be like like your online identity in a lot of ways nowadays encompasses a huge amount of your identity.
The final argument is I think that this is going to be really bad for user experience as well.
I'm imagining a future in which toyota makes a multi-billion dollar contract to use apple maps instead of google maps because apple pays them more and that really sucks for me if I have a toyota car because I think google maps is better and all kinds of like technological implications, proprietary software implications that are probably not going to be all that great.
So for all of those reasons, we should limit the internet of things."
"We should abandon feminism.
Now we want to be very clear in our model.
We're not saying that we should abandon the ideals of equality between men and women, but we're saying that the current organized approach for spreading that idea, the modern feminist movement, is not working and it's something that we should abandon for a different system to try and push those types of ideals of gender equality.
So that's what we're gonna talk about.
First the counterproductive image that feminism has, why it's intractable and why it's always going to under perform, and second why even in its modern form if it was successful it's not inclusive and spreads ideals that are harmful to many women.
So first on its image.
People view feminism as antimen, they view it as something that's politicized, something that is highly political and liberal and to a vast agree and has had a bad job of creating done a bad job of creating a brand that pulls people in.
One of the reasons this is that it was historically radical at the time that first wave feminism rose up it broke norms about women participation in government it broke norms about where women were supposed to be what roles in life they were supposed to serve how vocal they were supposed to be all these types of things that were incredibly radical in the past and feminism has been a radical movement and has always push the boundaries of what people believe women should be able to do.
They're also fringe sections of the movement that really are antimen but because it's been highly politicized these groups are often blown up on TV by places like fox news in order to paint feminism in a bad light and in part because of that there's a feedback cycle cycle that makes it even more hyper politicized.
It means that there's no chance to expand the minds under the to expand minds of people that don't already agree with you under the banner of feminism and the thing with social movements is you need to reach out to people that don't agree with you.
Social movements can't have any sort of growth, they can't have any sort of change, they can't have a foundation if they're not able to reach out and create that base and feminism clearly does not have a large enough base in the status quo to make all of the changes that it would like to see.
This is important because movements need broad support to succeed feminism support is capped by both demographics and political lines.
We would rather have another movement rise up and many people like emma watson the he for she movement etcetera exist as alternatives.
These would likely lead to more actual change but in order for them to do this they need to completely disassociate themselves with the feminist movement in order to be removed of that history removed of that politicization and allow people to simply see what the feminism movement is at its core that women and men should be treated equally.
But even if you don't buy any of that that it's counter productive we think that what feminism puts forward as feminism as good for women is not really good for woemn.
Even if it's not counterproductive mainstream feminism is bad for two large groups: first mainstream femenism is largely white it's just not inclusive intersectionality if you look at leaders the feminist movement historically they've been white if you look at leaders of the feminist movement today they are very white and it doesn't highlight the plight of minority women who make up fifty percent of the population and these women experience unique harms you can't just advocate for white women and expect that all the harms of the black or hispanic or asian women in modern society are going to be fixed.
It's simply not a big enough tent, it's become a movement for women who are best off the white working class and upper class liberals who were able to be advocated for in the movement but these are not the people that need the aid the most and we are rather have another movement that voices intersectional ideals.
Finally, mainstream feminism is incredibly it almost entirely excludes trans people from the movement and especially from leadership roles and it creates an increased stigma against these groups.
It creates divisions against queer against queer people and trans people in a way that simply shouldn't be tolerated again by social movement that needs to create as big a tent as possible.
For these reasons, we should abandon feminism."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban homeschooling.
Two main areas of clash: first, on how it doesn't prepare students academically.
Recognize that homeschooling has a very low barrier for teacher quality.
It's essentially just someone saying like, "" look, I'm qualified "", and passing a short online test that they could have faked in a million ways given that the internet exists.
This means that there's no way of ensuring that parents are actually prepared or allocating the correct amount of time in which they can teach their child everything that is necessary in school.
It also means that there's no actual oversight once the process has started.
So, even if you think that there's some kind of meaningful way in which we ensure that parents are initially prepared, it doesn't it means that like once things get busy and they have lives and jobs, they are very likely to get lax.
There's also no oversight against the students.
So even if parents are doing everything right, we think it's infinitely easy to slack off when your parents are gone for multiple hours of a day because they have a job than in a world in which your in school during that time and teachers oversee you for you.
We also think there are just like empirically too many subjects for one parent to be good at all of them.
Like students end up underdeveloped in specifics spheres, which is really bad, because it means that they never match up to like the the students that are trained by individuals who are specifically trained in those fields.
So you're always going to have a worse education, even if your parent is the best homeschooler in the world.
It this is bad on two levels.
First, it means that colleges are going to take your application less seriously.
Whenever they get a homeschooling application, they take it to mean that you are someone who is less prepared than your other people because, let's face it, you are, but second, because you are necessarily a risk that they have to take.
Even if they trust your resume and trust that you've done all the work, there's no way for them to guarantee it in the same way that they can guarantee it of someone who went to a regular school.
It also means that you're just going to physically be less prepared for tough classes than your counterparts who have been practicing with incredibly structured homework for the entire of their high school career.
It also lets religious people be incredibly oppressive of their children.
We think that religion, although something that can be empowering, is something that ought not be enforced upon young people the way that it is, where they are forced to grow up in religious environments and are never provided an alternative.
We think going to secular schools is necessarily something that shows children that there is a different way of living, that they may choose if they so want to.
We think that what religious people do is that they manipulate science and teach only creationism, which necessarily forces individuals into a religion and misinforms them about the way the world actually works.
Our second area of clash is about how it doesn't prepare students socially.
Recognize that school's important not just academically, but also because it teaches students social norms and behaviours that allow them to function in the real world.
Recognize that you can be the smartest person in the world, but if you don't know how to personally interact with someone or like process those ideas and give them to someone else, it doesn't matter how smart you are, because all of that information just gets trapped up inside you and never projected onto the outside world or meaningfully used in a real way.
We think insofar as the rest of your life is going to be interacting with other people, working on group projects, being in a professional environment, you need to have these kinds of skills, and it is bad that homeschooling does not provide you with them.
First, let's think about this on a social level.
If I don't go and interact with individuals my own age on a day-to-day basis, I will lever learn how to communicate with them or how those power dynamic work.
And so we think it's really bad when you're then released into college or the real world where you have to do this on a daily level, but you never have those heuristics.
But second, we think the real world is one in which you interact with teachers and other professionals.
Recognize that your future professors and bosses won't be your parents, and you need to know how to interact with authority that doesn't involve just making puppy dog eyes and begging your mother.
We think that this also involves like very simple skills, right?
Like knowing how to write a professional email, setting up a resume, these are things that often don't get taught in homeschooling because they're not seen as fundamental like skills in the same way that high school naturally develops them, just because you use them a lot.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"Airport racial profiling in the united states is justified.
So what we're talking about is that in the US, if you go to a major airport, the TSA, which is the big security agency, we'll look for people who they believe are of arab or perhaps persian heritage and attempt to search those people at a much greater rate and more thoroughly than they would search say white americans.
And we're arguing that this is something that the state should continue to do because it's just.
So, two main arguments.
The first is that we think that this racial profiling ultimately will stop acts of terror.
Recognize first of all, that there was relatively little racial profiling before the nine eleven attacks the nine eleven attacks happen.
Now there's a great deal of racial profiling but there hasn't been another major terror attack in the united states.
Conversely, rates of hijacking have continued to remain high in other parts of the world.
They've really only decreased here since nine eleven.
We think that greater security measures including profiling are the like the reason why.
It's true that it's difficult to separate the effectiveness of racial profiling from the effectiveness of greater airport security in general, but we think that clearly this tactic is working and since the purpose of airport security is to reduce hijacking and acts of terror, that we ought not change what we're doing.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
But on top of that, we think that it is ethically acceptable to profile given that it is effective.
We think that clearly if well, this airport profiling may be you know uncomfortable or frustrating to certain individuals, that the benefits to the general public of knowing that they can fly in safety are much greater.
On aggregate, the benefits of this policy to the majority of people are much greater than the harms to a small minority of people who suffer as a result of this policy.
We're perfectly fine with saying here that the ends justify the means.
If we get safer travel and if we do it by discomforting a small minority of people, then we're perfectly okay with risking that harm in order to achieve the greater end.
We think that what would be unjust would be to say that the right of a small minority of people not to be profiled is greater than the right of others to travel in relative safety.
One, because of the number of people affected and two, because we think that the potential harms of terror attacks grossly outweigh the harms of being felt up by a security official in an airport.
It's certainly unpleasant, but at the end of the day it's not the end of the world, where is for someone on the hijacked plane, that may well be the end of the world.
So with these arguments in mind, we think that it's clear that this is a just policy because it stops terrorists.
Our second argument is that this is a just policy because it is the public will.
We think that in order to be just, a liberal democracy like the united states must obey the public will and the american people clearly support profiling at airports.
They re-elected george bush, they were broadly supportive of the creation of the TSA, and if they resent the TSA now it's because they don't like having to take their laptop out at security, not that they're opposed to the agency in and of itself.
We think that the american government has an obligation to act as it's people would have it act.
The senators and congress people in the US are not trustees who act as the betters of the american people to make decisions for them.
They are representatives who reflect the will of the people.
At that point we think it would be very much unjust for them to ignore this.
We think that the policy is justified because it is supported by public opinion.
Now the other side is going to tell you that individual rights can't be subject to majority approval, but we tell you that the right being violated here, namely the right to travel in comfort at the airport, is of a fairly low level.
We're not talking about hurting people physically here.
So at the end of the day, we think that this is acceptable.
For these reasons, we think that airport racial profiling in the US is justified.
Thank you."
"Immigration to the united states brings more good than harm.
In this debate round we're going to be talking about two aspects in which immigration has a traumatically dramatically positive impact on the society of the united states.
So we're going to talk about the economic impacts of immigration and we're going to talk about the cultural impacts of immigration.
Firstly, we want to talk about how when people immigrate to the united states the economic impacts tend to be positive despite the fact that there's rhetoric that goes on in spheres of political discourse that immigrants to the united states steal american jobs and and harm progress and do things like this.
The evidence is rather to the contrary.
Firstly, rather than stealing jobs, immigrants to the united states provide two types of labor that are crucial.
Firstly is low skilled labor.
Currently in the united states there's a massive lack of supply of low skilled labor.
There's a lot of people that are driven to go into higher education and there's a general stigma amongst the populace in the united states that your education shouldn't result in you going into trade work in low skilled work like construction, farming, etcetera.
But immigrants to the united states are able to fill these jobs which are crucial to the functioning of society, whether it's developing infrastructure that allows people to function to live their lives and for the economy to grow or it's doing things like agricultural work that feed our society.
These are crucial jobs that are necessary for the economic productivity and the general stability of american society that without an immigrant work force, in the united states simply would not be able to fulfill because of the lack of supply from labor sources within the united states itself.
But secondly, we also think that there is high skilled labor that ends up coming to the united states.
And this high skilled labor is also incredibly useful.
High skilled labor ends up coming to the united states in large part because of the education resources that we have here.
So a lot of foreign individuals come to the united states to have their education and then end up staying here after their graduation.
These individuals are also incredibly useful.
Firstly because they end up going into higher paying jobs which provides a larger tax base that the united states can tax from and then we distribute for the good of the society to do other positive things.
Whatever the government may see fit.
But secondly it ensures that innovators are coming into the united states and continue to make progress within the economy.
Oftentimes immigrants that come to the united states come with a different understanding of harms that may be going on in society or a different understanding of niches and niche opportunities that may be fulfilled within the market and they're able to bring this revenue into the united states in a positive way that we think adds to the again adds to the marketplace of ideas that exists in economic discourse but also allows for greater economic growth.
The second way that we think immigrants are positive to the united states are through cultural impacts.
Immigrants come with an entirely different understanding of how the world works in some instances and some instances it's it's fairly similar.
But broadly we think that immigrants end up bringing a diversity to the united states that is positive.
When multiple cultures er exist within one community, it allows for a growth of culture.
It allows for cultures to borrow from one another and allows cultures to simulate between each other in a way that allows for people to become more well rounded, to have a different understanding of the world that is outside of what they've been taught in their own backyards, what they've been taught from their families and their neighborhoods.
It allows them to get a more diverse understanding of the people that exist within the world and a more empathetic understanding of the struggles that people go through in other areas.
While people may have hostility towards immigrants in certain areas, in areas where people interact with these people on a daily basis and are able to understand the struggles that they've gone through in order to be in the united states, we think it bridges cultural empathy beyond just the borders that exist the united states that doesn't just help the people in the united states become more caring and more understanding and also have many opportunities and and cultural experiences that they wouldn't have wouldn't have had otherwise but also is helpful in directing the united states to be a positive force for good in the world broadly.
And for these reasons we think that immigration to the united states brings more good than harm."
"We should further exploit small modular reactors.
When we say we're going to further exploit the small modular reactors, we mean that we should further increase our use of these things, both in more remote areas that struggle to get their electrical needs and for businesses, large manufacturing areas that require immense amounts of electricity that may want to move off the grid, and we think that this should be subsidized in large part by the government in order for people to adopt these things en masse.
Okay.
So, two reasons why we think that small modular reactors are good: first is that nuclear energy is generally quite clean as compared to fossil fuels and and other alternative energies, and the second is about the immense energy potential and why this is so important, especially moving forward in a developing world.
Okay.
So, on clean energy: compared to fossil fuels, nuclear reactors and small modular reactors having much lower impact on the environment.
They don't because the type of deforestation and environmental degradation that fracking and other types of drilling cause.
They don't require you to clear out large swathes of land in order to use these types of things, and they don't create the excess CO two that leads to global warming.
This is crucial, because it's important to recognize that global warming is not only happening, but it's happening dramatically and quickly and that we need to quickly shift away from what we're doing in the status quo in order to prevent the worst effects of global warming from happening.
In order to do this, we need to take advantage of all of all the resources that are available to us for renewable energy.
We can't just we can't just resort to solar and wind and say that the job is done.
We need to try and move the entire grid off of fossil fuels as quickly as possible.
To do this, we think that small modular reactors are going to be a necessary way of enacting these changes, especially in areas that are much more remote than others, that aren't able to get access to these other types of renewable energy, for example, in areas where wind power and solar power simply is not going to meet the burden.
It's also important to recognize that meltdowns generally are quite rare.
So when the opposition may say that small modular reactors are bad because you're more likely to get a meltdown, firstly, these are actually less likely and more efficient than large nuclear facilities to have a meltdown, and the rates of some sort of a meltdown are incredibly low compared to, for example, the likelihood of an oil spill from an oil rig contaminating and ruining the environment for decades to come.
These things happen much more likely, yet we don't completely force people to to flee from fossil fuels.
We think that we have a comparatively cleaner technology that we should adopt, especially due to the impacts of global warming.
Secondly, on the immense energy potential.
The type of energy creation this is the type of energy creation that can be done in almost any environment.
So unlike other types of renewable fuels and other types of fossil fuels, you don't really need to have any sort of particular geographical advantage in order to use a small modular reactors.
They also be lower cost of energy than almost any other source once you get the energy up and running.
Once you have a bulk use of small modular reactors, they're much easier to create, on the cheap, per kilowatt of energy than other types of energy, and this is why we should try to subsidize these things.
So that we can get the market up to scale in order to make it efficient enough and cheap enough to be worthwhile.
We would say that the grid is only going to be more heavily used in the future as more and more people become developed and start needing the electricity to live a modern life.
Given that this is the case, we're going to need more to power the future, and it needs to be done more efficiently than possible or than has previously been done and is certainly being done in the status quo.
In order to do this, we think a clean technology such as nuclear is a smart way to go and for these reasons, we should further exploit small modular reactors."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of today's motion, that we should adopt open source software.
So, the model here's, I think, kind of intuitive, in that this is just a thing that we find to be good for the market, good for consumers, good for corporations, that on balance this has done more good than harm.
So, under this two independent points: first, that this is a beneficial thing for corporations, and secondly, that this is beneficial for consumers.
First, on the point regarding corporations: I think it's important to recognize, that this is a product that decreases production costs, this is true for two reasons: first is that it decreases the labor costs associate with the product.
Think something like, google chrome for example, which allows lots of extensions to be added onto the initial product.
Now, normally, if this was a standard browser, without this open source aspect to it, you would have to engage it like, hiring lots of people that would make these extensions, that would tweak the browser in this way.
But secondly, you also decrease overhead production costs, things like server costs, and maintenance, and things like that, because you're able to outsource a lot of the processing, and a lot of the actual development to basically your users.
You're not the one making this product, a lot of your users do it for you, and that decreases the labor costs.
And, there's any number of ways that can benefit the corporation, they can decrease the cost of their product on the front end, which then increases their sales, they can invest it into other products they are potentially developing, there are any number of ways this could benefit you.
But secondly, it leads to better technology, that again is something that benefits the corporation, because it actually increases the value of your product.
When you're able to target the individual needs of consumers, by allowing them to make the tweaks that they need, and you are able to look at the tweaks that they made, and say: oh okay, this is what they want, these are the types of things we should be working on, because these are the issues that they currently have, that makes your products a lot better, because you're more able to efficiently target what the market demands.
So, that in turn increases the value of the thing you're producing.
My second independent point regards how this is beneficial to consumers.
So, to things under this: first is that it that it increases the quality of the technology you are using.
The technology you're using.
So, two reasons why this is true.
First is that it allows more personalized options.
When you allow this open source technology, when you have this proliferating across the marketplace, you have, like, more development on an individual product.
Again using the example of chrome, there's lots of different ways you can customize this program, in such a way that allows you to basically say: okay, this is what I as an individual person need.
And maybe there's a group of you, that needs a particular thing that, generally, the market wouldn't have an incentive to provide for, because you are such a niche group of people, even at the individual level.
So, that in turn means that the open source nature of the software allows people to tweak it that aren't it just people working in, you know, google headquarters, people that are on the ground using the product, and that in turn means that you are uniquely benefited by the increased quality of this, insofar as it benefits you as an individual.
But secondly, that there's more collaborators on the product.
So, when there's just, you know, more heads working together, basically saying how can we make this thing better, you are going to get a better end product at the end of the day, something that is just, you know, better at doing whatever it is designed to do.
But beyond just the quality of the product, the price also goes down under open source software for you, for basically the same reasons that it does for corporations, because the decreased labor costs and things like that are inevitably going to, in some capacity, be transferred off to the consumer, because the corporation has a financial incentive to keep their products cheap.
That, in turn, benefits you for what are probably pretty intuitive reasons, when things are cheaper, you have more discretionary income, you can spend that on things that you as an individual find valuable and so forth.
For all these reasons, proud to propose, and proud to support a world that has open source software."
"We should ban smacking because it's a form of child abuse, because parents have no right to physically abuse their kids, because it's absolutely something we can enforce and because I'm you know what it's a form of paternalism for parents' parts because it leads to worse parenting anyway, and it raises their kids in a worse way.
So let's start by talking about why physically beating your child is absolutely wrong.
It's wrong for a couple of reasons: first because it harms the kid.
Because even if something like spanking may seem harmless, it's a fine line between spanking and abuse.
Especially if you do it continuously, especially if you do it particularly hard and this is oftentimes likely, because if you spank if you're spanking your child, it's probably because you're pretty pissed off at your child.
The kid did something that you don't like so you're going to physically you're gonna spank them to like pay them back, try to teach them a lesson.
So given that parents are doing this when they're not in a very good mood, when they're angry, when they wanna teach their kids a lesson, it's not necessarily incumbent on them to be in the mind set where they're going to be particularly gentle.
Especially because it's not like kids if they're being like gently touched, you're not really teaching them that much of a lesson.
So the entire point of it is that you need to cause them pain.
You need to make them cry or something like that.
And that's simply something that's not right.
It's not right because it's mean to the kid but also because who do parents think they are that they can just do that to kids?
Parents don't have ownership over their child.
They're it's it's like a slave master mentality where you can whip somebody.
It's absolutely ludicrous that you think that you have the right to hit another human being, to make them physically suffer, to make them be physically tormented, to physically do something, to physically try to harm them just because you want to teach them a lesson.
Just because you think it's going to make them act better or behave better.
It's absolutely horrible and it's absolutely not something that we should allow to be legal in a progressive society.
But besides that I also think that it's quite bad as far as the values that it's going to ingrain in societies , and in our children, for several reasons: first, because I think that it normalizes violence.
I think that when kids are exposed to spanking at a young age as a means of discipline, it implicates in them the idea that violence is a positive means to get people to do what you want them to do, and that if you physically harm somebody you're going you're going to get results from them.
And it's these kinds of stupid ideologies that make people think that things like torture actually works.
It's these kinds of ideologies that make it think that things like making people suffer is a good way to ultimately make there be more justice in the world and ultimately fix problems in the world.
And those are things that are incredibly bad.
But additionally it's foolish to actually think that these that spanking is actually going to lead to better discipline for kids in most cases.
Because when you physically spanking your kid, it's not like you're actually going to really teach them all that much.
You're likely just going to teach them the hide from you, to lie to you, to deceive you so that way they're going to avoid the problem.
That's the same thing with torture, where people lie because they want the pain to stop.
Like, kids are just going to figure out ways to do what they do but be more deceptive about it, because they're smart and because they want to do things that they're doing that parents don't like.
That's kind of how human nature works.
But the next thing that I want to talk about is that I think there's more effective alternatives.
And those effective alternatives could be things like grounding a kid, not letting them go out and hang out with their friends.
Taking away like an electronic from them.
That's a perfectly acceptable nonviolent way to get your point across and it's equally persuasive and much more humane.
So for all those reasons we should ban spanking."
"We should introduce a flat tax.
In the status quo the majority of income taxes in western liberal democracies are progressive taxes that disproportionately tax wealthy earners and take their money even though they are the people that are least likely to take government services.
For this reason we would propose that the states or that states introduce an income tax that is a flat tax that ensures that all people that are capable of paying taxes were not going to eliminate a minimum earnings limit that allows you to have a taxable income because we think that certain people simply cannot pay taxes because of the situation they're in.
But in instances in which people can afford to pay taxes, all people have to pay the same proportion of their income into the government.
So we think that it's essential that this occurs because recognize that all individuals are exist under a coercive apparatus of the state.
No matter how wealthy one is or how poor one is, all people have been forced into the state by circumstances of where they were born or because of where they had to go to live for jobs or other types of social reasons.
No one entirely freely chooses to be within the state, and even if they did the state cannot simply, because of consent, choose to abuse its people.
The state can only be justified, can only exist in a just way, if it serves to benefit all of its people.
This means that the state has an equal burden to all citizens, even if certain citizens, through their own free power and capabilities, are able to earn more within the state apparatus then other individuals.
What we think this means is that when you have other systems of taxation such as a progressive tax, you choose to ignore the claims of representation that certain members of your constituency have.
And it means that you're saying that the freedom of property the freedom to accumulate property and accumulate wealth is different once you get richer.
It says that the humanity and the claims you have to ownership are diluted when you are a more wealthy human being.
And it's more important to recognize that the vast majority of wealthy individuals in western liberal democracies are not individuals that are taking the types of social benefits that taxes go to pay.
They pay into certain things that they're simply never going to use.
Things like welfare benefits, things like social security, these are things that wealthy individuals are forced to pay into but gain little benefit from.
Yes, it's true that these individuals gain benefit from infrastructure, protection from the army, all these things just as everyone else does, but it is the case that these individuals simply are not getting as much out of the government directly as poor individuals are.
What this means is that it is unfair, principally, to force these people to pay more and that when you have progressive taxes it allows for drastic spending to take place because it because constituencies and a base of people in the public know that they will not be the ones that have to bear the burden, the spending burden, that increased government spending costs.
We think that if you're going to institute no new government programs if you're going to place more coercive power into state hands, if you're going to ensure that the state is more capable of taking from the people within the state and stealing the property that they have earned, it is important that all people bear the ramifications of this equally.
Yes it is the case that less less wealthy individuals have less disposable income at their at their disposal but this doesn't mean that their claims to ownership change because of the quantity of ownership that you have.
Rather claims of ownership matter because of the importance of valuing property in a broad and principled manner.
We think that flat taxes to the best job of representing that and flat taxes do the best job of ensuring that not only do all people bear the same burden, but all people are given the same level of right to property as anyone else.
In the status quo there's a system that allows spending to run wild in the government level with the burden being pushed dramatically on a small segment of society.
That burden isn't fair given the responsibility the state has to all citizens and the conception that the state serves to serve exists to serve all.
Given this we should introduce a flat tax."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban herbal medicine.
Two main areas of clash: the first on long term efficacy.
So recognize that herbal medicine is always going to be less effective than the than the one that is actually tested and provided by hospitals and professionals.
This is because most of the organic compounds that work have already been incorporated from herbs into proper medication.
So if you're trying to actually fix or cure a condition it will always be more effective not to use the herbal remedy.
This is important because the way that diseases change in mutate mean that even if this might work a little bit, a lot of disease is not covered is not cured completely, and then can mutate and come back stronger.
Or if you don't cure it all the way, it just stays around for much longer and wreaks more havoc in your body so at the end of the condition you are much sicker when you actually gain real treatment.
It's also dangerous because real medicines are less likely to work afterwards.
Because if you have a condition that has gotten stronger over time or a condition that has mutated, and thus no longer responds to your previous medication, it it can become immune to the medication that hospitals offer as well.
This is dangerous because it affects not just the individual who is using the herbal remedy, but rather spreads to other people as well.
Because now this mutated form of the disease is also spreadable through contact or whatever way by which that disease was spreadable before.
So at the point that it can have this very large effect with regards to efficacy, we think that it ought not be permitted.
We also think that it decreases the overall quality of hospital care.
When it doesn't work in when the herbal remedy doesn't work, these people still end up filling the hallways of hospitals and waiting in line to get there.
So now you've made it worse and so your wait time for others is much longer, and because it's much more difficult to treat it is likely that the doctor will have to spend longer with you and you're going to have to spend longer treating it, so like follow up visits, etcetera.
We also think that it makes you more sick in the long term.
If it comes back it's going to do so in a stronger form and a lot of the time there are side effects to herbal medicines that are since they're are very rarely verified as safe for humans, often sold by third party vendors and other such situations.
So, we think that the point that using this and we also think that a lot of the time people can have allergy impacts that they didn't know they had before and so they take this medicine that was supposed to cure one thing, not only did it not work and not only did it cause side effects, but it also created a situation in which they now have allergies to it.
And more than this, it's also very easy to miss-dose because when you're using actual medication, provided to you by a verified provider, you're going to have medication based specifically on your weight and your characteristics.
But when you're going to getting herbal remedies it's a much more guess and check kind of method.
They're not really, like their measuring it out based on past experiences but not necessarily based on scientific fact.
So that can be very dangerous in so far as now you might be taking much more of a compound than you actually need which can make you much sicker in the long term.
Our second area clash has to do with economics both on a personal and a hospital based level.
So on the personal level we think a lot of the time herbal medication specifically targeted at populations that distrust hospitals or are trying to save money.
The problem with this is that it ends up more expensive over time, because not only do you have to buy this herbal remedy but when it doesn't work you're going to have to pay either for more herbal remedy if you haven't learned your lesson yet, or for the actual medication that you were trying to avoid buying from the beginning.
And often times if you made the condition worse or if it changed forms or if you caught something else at the same time, the medications that you have to buy are even more expensive than they previously were or you have to afford a higher dose.
If people avoid this entirely from the beginning, they're actually going to be not only cured much earlier, but paying much less in the long term.
So we think that's enough to ban it in the first place.
Second though, on hospital based economics.
Frivolous diseases mean longer wait time for others and longer time spent by doctors.
Which means they're actually like requiring more money based on your visit with them.
We also think that it wastes hospital resources for no particular reason, which raises the cost.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"We should abandon the insanity plea.
Basically what we mean by this is that the insanity plea would no longer be a valid plea in court.
You couldn't get a reduced sentence or acquitted based on it.
Three main area of clash.
First, we want to talk about the definition and the definitional integrity of what a crime is.
Because a crime isn't about the context, rather it's about the act.
Even if someone was incredibly poor and stole a loaf of bread, you still wouldn't say that they were excused from punishment for that crime because stealing, regardless of the context behind it, is still a crime.
Like you might feel bad for them, but they would still be in the abstract deserving of the same amount of punishment as someone who was stealing that same loaf of bread just for the sake of stealing.
So but in in the same way, being crazy while you kill someone doesn't change that you killed them.
That person is still dead, and you're still the one who committed the act.
Our criminal justice system doesn't exist to diagnose.
It exists to apply an objective standard, and it needs to be separated from society, and it needs to be something that isn't influenced by societal turns because, in the end, you're judging the act of an individual, not what they were thinking while doing it.
You need to have like they're we also think that criminally insane still means that you're a criminal, right?
Like, there are a few purposes that our justice system and jail have.
A few of them include making sure that those people are separated from society so they can't do more damage and providing retribution for the victim offended affected.
And both of these things still apply to the individual, even if they are insane.
And we think that rehab still applies.
We also think that what happens on their side of the house is that you turn trials into the push and pulls of a psychiatrist because in the end, you can find one that'll say literally anything.
Like, one side's going to bring their psychiatrist, the other's going to bring theirs, and it becomes a competition to see which one happens to sound more professional or happens to be more approachable.
We prefer to stick to as objective facts as possible when you're deciding issues of someone going to jail for a really long period of time or basically life-altering decisions.
Our second area of clash is about how the insanity plea lends itself to unjust bias.
Insanity is a perception dependent defense.
People have to have a conception of what insanity looks like, and this means that someone has to present in a way that might look prone to insanity.
So, a white woman is much more likely to get away on an insanity plea because there's a preconception in society that they are weak, hysteria prone, and fragile of mind.
But a black man would never be let go based on insanity, because they're perceived as angry and violence prone and so, regardless of whether the actual mental state of that person was insane or not, they would never get the plea because society perceives them as willful in their violence.
Celebrities often get off on it because the public eye sees them as people who are prone to cracking.
Like, we have so many stories about the celebrity who started as a kid and then went crazy when they got older that it's almost become automatic to excuse celebrity actions based on their perceived mental state.
We think that in the end, there's the insanity plea depends too much on emotional appeal for it to be an objective standard used in a court of law.
Our third area of clash is why we think that the insanity plea provides a problematic excuse.
The definition of insanity is incredibly wishy-washy.
Some people conceptualize it as like as simple as someone being gay is considered, like, possessed by demons or insane, while others see like very basic mental illnesses as being enough for insanity.
Like we think that until we've settled on a true definition and something that we can objectively measure in a quantitative way, we don't think that this is something that you can use, and you don't want someone to make it a self-justification.
Like we think recently we've had an upsurge in people that go to court and plead the insanity plea, because they see it as a route by which they can prove their innocence and decrease their jail time.
And we want to take that path away because it doesn't actually take away from the action.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should ban home births.
I think again we're talking specifically within the united states.
By home births we don't mean like someone didn't know that they were about to like go into labor and accidentally had a kid at home rather we mean like the planned event of having a home birth the midwife etcetera.
Like we think it's fine that if someone gets stuck in like a surprise circumstance where they're suddenly having a baby and they don't have time to get a to a hospital, then we think this is okay.
We're just talking about like we don't think that as like we we we should generally expect individuals to go to a hospital.
The government should punish those that are found to have planned out a home birth.
Two main areas of clash, first on validating government paternalism.
Recognize that there are two worlds in which we allow the government to ban things and both of these like either of these things is sufficient to allow for a ban insofar as these are like the two standards that you can meet individually in the status quo.
First we think and we think that like home births justifies at least one probably justifies to both.
So first we think that there has to be pertinent government interest and we think that this is actually like somewhere where home birth being banned is really important because insofar as governments spend a lot of time funding the hospitals that perform the majority of births they have like a focused interest in those hospitals being used properly, efficiently, that money being used efficiently and once swathes of the population are participating in an unsafe practice that can be prevented then we think that this is something the government has an interest in protecting and preventing.
We also think that childbirth is something that is especially dangerous.
Recognize that it's still the leading cause of death in many developing countries for women not to mention like if we go even a century back this is something that like killed copious and copious women copious amounts of women.
So we think that this is like in itself something that has been demonstrated as a threat to the general population then given that the government has to protect its citizens one of the ways it does so is in preventing home births from happening because that's the way in which women died right like that they'd like because there weren't hospitals available they would have children at their house and they would suffer from things like internal bleeding that that like midwives have no ability to handle even in the status quo.
The second way though in which the government gets justified to ban things is when there's a spillover effect.
So even if we buy that a person can make decisions that are personally harmful to themselves we think that this stops being justified when they have when they are like doing something that harms others like there's no right to harm another person.
This is why we do things like ban drugs like hard drugs that like harm other individuals even recognize that like cigarette smoking is fine to harm yourself so we think that like the problem is that even if the mom can like do things that are bad for her we think that the unborn child shouldn't suffer because their parents are hippies who are making poor decisions and we think that insofar that child is a lot more vulnerable than the woman in this case we know that that child's rights are also going to matter more like the woman's already decided to bring this kid into the world it's going to be a live baby we might as well value that this baby gets into the world healthfully and as safely as possible.
Our second area of clash is about the validation of medicine and technology.
Recognize there is no good reason to have a home birth.
Hospitals can do things that facilitate natural births, water births, no epidurals, all of the things that people often glamorize about having a birth at home hospitals can also provide.
Home births are just like this like beacon of hippie nonsense that sometimes works out but like oftentimes ends in especially for like women who are older or less healthy in massive amounts of complications that midwives have to hand off to ambulances anyway but by the time that they did that ambulance ride becomes a lot more expensive and it also just becomes a lot more difficult to treat than if you're able to catch these circumstances earlier as you can do in a hospital and so we think that it's actually really important to protect the integrity of hospitals with this like growing hippie rhetoric like hospitals are more dangerous than being at home, that like natural is good we think it's good when the government signals that hospitals are the most trustworthy and are going to be the safest so we think that this is like a positive intervention.
Proud to propose."
"We should end affirmative action.
So, affirmative action is a policy whereby members of a historically disadvantaged group are given preferential treatment in some way.
As an example of this, public universities in some states in the US, like california, how are required to admit certain amounts of students from different minority backgrounds, not just white students.
We see that in the past minority students were denied access to universities and that this is a way of ensuring their inclusion.
In the US these policies have been popular since the nineteen seventies and are seen both in the public sphere, for things like government hiring and public universities, and the private sphere, in private schools and universities, and in business for hiring as well.
We think that these policies should be phased out over time in developed countries where they probably already run their course.
Three arguments for you today: the first is about the backlash that affirmative action policies cause.
Right now when you have lots of qualified people applying for jobs, for instance, we think that oftentimes people feel that they don't receive a position because of affirmative action.
There's a certain narrative unfortunately in the united states, which is something like: "" a black woman took my job. ""
Whereby white men who feel entitled to certain benefits or positions or spots in universities greatly resent people who they think have only out competed them because of affirmative action.
This sets aside that those people who are getting it instead of them might have better exam scores, or more qualifications or a higher certification.
Ultimately, all of the success that people of color or women have is placed as an effect of affirmative action.
This leads people to have a more negative opinion of those groups, because they think that they're being treated unfairly in comparison to minorities or to women.
But what's more, we think it also undermines the achievements of minorities and women.
When they're successful, it's all attributed to special treatment.
And when they're unsuccessful it's held up as a reason why these people were always going to fail.
We think that ultimately women and people of color would be able to get more respect while facing similar amounts of opportunity if we got rid of affirmative action.
At the end of the day in the US it is no longer acceptable to be openly racist or sexist in hiring, so we don't think that things like quotas are needed as much anymore, while meanwhile they have some real harms as we've just explained, therefore we ought end affirmative action.
Our second argument is that affirmative action doesn't help the neediest people.
Consider for instance which women are the most likely to benefit from affirmative action hiring.
It's likely to be wealthy white women who went to good colleges, rather than low income women or women from a disadvantaged background.
So someone like theresa may or hillary clinton might benefit from affirmative action, but ultimately those aren't really the people that society needs to be helping.
Because we think rich white women are doing pretty well as we as we move on.
So ultimately the benefits aren't accruing to the most needy.
The benefits of affirmative action will always accrue to the most privileged people in whatever strada you try to help.
The richest black people, the richest women are ultimately the ones who are the most likely to be able to take advantage of affirmative action.
So we think that other policies that are more intelligent and target those actually in need, would be a better way to allocate resources.
So our third point is about better policies that are available.
We think that for instance tracking for many parts of a person's identity and taking those into account would be better than affirmative action.
So rather than perhaps saying: "" oh we need more black people in our universities so we're going to admit five percent black people instead of three percent, like my alma mater recently did "" we could say: "" this person comes from a particular background as an individual, and we should respect their background and acknowledge that maybe they didn't have certain advantages growing up "".
And by treating people as individuals in this way, you would avoid essentializing people and have less backlash as well.
So for all of these reasons we should end affirmative action.
Thank you."
"We should ban genetically modified crops.
Now, I want to be very clear.
What we're talking about in these debate are relatively recent genetically modified crops, where companies like monsanto have modified their genes and have patented or copyrighted certain genetic combinations.
We're not talking about the older sense of genetic modification, wherein people would for instance breed a better banana.
We're fine with that sort of thing.
What we're opposed to is the contemporary idea of genetically modifying plants in such a way that you can patent and trademark particular instances of that plant or of that living creature.
Our first argument is that there is a lack of information on the long term risk of this type of gene editing.
We tell you that ultimately because we can't predict the fallout of editing individual genes in a living creature over the next few dozen years, that ultimately there's too great a risk to society to allow this to go on willy nilly.
Consider that if, for instance, we are unknowingly editing some sort of weakness into all of our grain, and then we plant it all across the earth, that ultimately we run the risk of famine in the future.
Now this may not seem likely, but ultimately we have no way to assess how likely this risk is because no one's really been able to assess the effects of genetic engineering in the long term.
We have lots of studies and assurances that this is safe, but most of them are funded by companies like monsanto that stand to benefit directly from these processes actually being legalized and encouraged.
So ultimately we think that it's important to be prudent here with something like our food security.
Traditional food, or traditionally genetically modified foods, continue to supply more then enough food to feed everyone in the world.
Remember that scarcity is a problem of poor governance and not of food production.
Enough food rots every year to more than feet all the people going hungry.
So we think that ultimately we should be prudent with our genetic editing and focus on distributing food more efficiently, so that people don't go hungry.
Our second argument is that genetically modified crops lead to a lack of consumer choice.
What we mean by this is that people don't really consent into consuming genetically modified crops.
As I said before, the long term health risks of consuming these crops are unknown and much of the research surrounding them has been funded by the same companies that stand to benefit from them.
With that in mind, we think it's problematic that people have very little way to know what, especially refined products contain genetically modified crops.
People ultimately aren't able to make an intelligent decision about what they want to consume.
And we think that because there is this lack of information for consumers, the state needs to intervene until some scheme has come up with which allows people to -fully consent to consuming these types of food.
So with that in mind I think it's clear that we should ban these crops until people are able to consent to consuming them in a meaningful way.
Our final argument is about limiting corporate control of the food supply.
If everyone in the US starts planting grains which are trademarked by monsanto, suddenly this one corporation has unprecedented power over the global food supply.
We think that ultimately we need to avoid this level of corporate control, because it poses a threat to providing for everyone in need.
If a corporation decides that they want to, for instance, raise the price of their seed, then everyone in the world would have to pay higher prices for food.
We think this is unacceptable.
And what's more because these genetic edits are trademarked, you can't just go somewhere else and by a different type of seed the way you would otherwise.
You're locked into using it.
I remember reading about one instance where a farmer was sued because even though he didn't plant the corn that was genetically modified, some of it blew into his fields from the wind and grew there and monsanto was able to sue him for letting that corn and grow with the rest of his crop.
We think that this type of corporate control is out of control, and that until further regulation comes into play, we should ban these crops.
So for all these reasons we should ban genetically modified crops.
Thank you."
"Single sex schools should be banned.
On our side we're going to argue that it would be better if there were no single sex schools funded for primary, secondary or college level education.
So whether this be religious or public schools, we think that in general they're a bad thing for students.
Our first argument is that single sex schools do not prepare people adequately to interact with the rest of the real world.
When students go to a single sex school, they're being socialized like anyone else.
School is ultimately a sort of laboratory that teaches us how to interact with the real world as citizens and as workers.
But if you go to school in an environment that's completely artificial, that doesn't reflect the real world, then you're not being trained to work in the real world.
Let's think about how this affects boys first, and then girls.
For boys, this means that they're not learning to interact with women as equals and in a respectful way.
The environment that they're in in an all boys school is one in which women are completely absent.
Unfortunately this reflects many board rooms in the western world.
But what we tell you is that if boys aren't exposed to girls who are smarter faster stronger better than they are, that they won't go on to respect women as much afterwards.
So the comparison is between co-ed schools, where you socialize boys to respect women at a younger age, versus having boys go to single sex schools and then be turned out into the real world with no idea how to interact with women in a respectful healthy way.
Then if you think about all girl schools, many of their proponents would argue that all girl schools help women, because they let them take leadership positions and not have to interact with men in a negative way during their formative years.
But this doesn't really prepare people for the real world.
If you go to an all women's school, or an all girls school, then you aren't learning how to interact in a world where men unfortunately do receive preferential treatment and discriminate against women.
Ultimately, we think that this doesn't prepare you for the challenges that you're very likely to face in your life.
We think that girls in particular will be better served by sending them to school with boys, so that they learn - one, that they're able to compete outcompete boys, but on top of that that they also learn how to interact in a world that is fundamentally very sexist, something that they're less likely to learn if they live in this kind of sandbox environment where they don't interact that much with boys.
Now, my opponents might say that boys and girls will both interact with the opposite sex outside of school, but when you spend eight to ten hours a day in school we think ultimately this is still harmful for your development, for all the reasons that I've explained.
Our second argument is that these schools are fundamentally discriminatory.
First I'd just like to point out that there is a small but growing portion of young people who are coming to terms with non binary identities.
Whether this be transgender people or other groups, who are excluded from single sex schools.
We think that this is unfair to those people, and that for transgender children in a single sex school, their situation is even more precarious because they don't have anyone of the opposite sex to interact with and to engage with.
But we'd also like to point out that they're discriminatory because of the allocation of resources.
Let's say that you have a really good french teacher in your town, for instance, and you have a boys school in a girls school.
This teacher works at one or the other, so either only the boys or the girls get access to this good teacher.
We think that this is fundamentally unfair and that sex shouldn't determine which students have access to which educational resources and which teachers.
Now, some might say that you could have cooperation between the schools, but that seems to defeat the purpose of single sex education.
We'd also like to argue that these are discriminatory because people are paying taxes for schools that their children can never attend, that ultimately yes, we require people to pay taxes even if they don't have children, but it seems wrong to require people to fund a school that their children are, because of an immutable characteristic, never going to be able to use.
Our third and final point is that single sex schools are inefficient.
We think that in general having larger schools allows a better allocation of resources.
Everyone can study with that same french teacher that I mentioned before.
In the same way, we can build facilities like sports stadiums or gymnasiums, we can have things like musical instruments available for students, that are ultimately going to be used by more people.
So this is a better investment of government funds.
For all these reasons we should not allow single sex schools.
Thank you."
"We should end mining.
We mean by this is that we would stop all of the current coal mines that exist in the status quo and just no longer engage in this practice going into the future.
Three main areas of clash, first on why this is inherently abusive.
Recognize that mining is a uniquely dangerous job.
First physically individuals are infinitely more likely to get hit by falling down debris, there are going to be gas leaks that can choke people.
This is why we had things like literal birds that would sit in cages who would sing when they started to suffocate but a lot of the time people just weren't able to make it out in time regardless.
So we think that that's something that is very important but also like after you exit like the rates of lung cancer and other forms of cancer like the rates of pneumonia all of this becomes a lot higher after you've worked in the mining industry.
This is much more dangerous than the majority of the jobs that we have access to because even if things like athletics are likely to destroy your bones they're not likely to make it so that you can physically not live a higher quality like a basic standard of living into the future like you're still going to usually be able to walk you're just not going to be able to work in athletics here this prevents you from being able to do things like breathe or like drink water like very basic acts that you need to do for the rest of your life.
It's also unstable in a different regard in that when you finish that mine in that region there's usually nothing left over, there isn't actually any job stability associated with mining because it is so regional and so dependent on that mine continuing to have coal or whatever your mining in it.
People might say okay but look you can consent to this because you need a job but we also think there isn't meaningful consent because meaningful consent implies that you are choosing from alternatives because only then can you evaluate one to be better than the other and choose that otherwise it would be the equivalent of someone holding a gun to my head and saying you have to mine because that's essentially what's happening if I don't take this job I won't be able to feed my family so on so forth.
It becomes the only option for those that have no alternatives, those who might be uneducated can't find a job who need the money if there aren't any alternatives and there isn't any consent in the same way that we wouldn't call someone holding a gun to my head and making me do something a consensual decision.
Second though we want to talk about why it's bad for the environment.
Very basic things like the fact that it often leaks into the ground and into water systems that poison entire towns we think that flint, michigan is both an issue of the fact that those pipes weren't particularly well-set but also an issue that there are a lot of mines nearby that infected that water like we see fracking happening in rural pennsylvania and like along the canadian border and we see that their water supply gets infected because you are literally underground messing with things which is what mining does.
This impact millions of people who live locally and prevents them from being able to access basic drinking water.
It also has large machinery that often emits greenhouse gases in a way that is a lot worse and like particularly bad for those areas because they create unhealthy air for people to breathe so we see that asthma that the existence of asthma in children is a lot higher when they grew up in mining towns than elsewhere but also like recognize there's other issues like we've literally seen entire villages and entire towns being sucked up into a mining hole because they left this massive gap in the ground in those areas fell into them like when fire start in them that pollutes for years and years and years because no one can get down there to pull put it out like these things are just too risky to be engaged with.
Our third area of clash is about entrenching the use of fossil fuels.
Look unless we start taking action to prevent the methods that people use to obtain fossil fuels we're never going to stop the practice and we all know how bad those are for the environment and the individual.
Stop mining, stop fossil fuels.
Proud to propose."
"American jobs act brought more good than harm.
So, we think that this debate is fundamentally about whether or not on balance the american jobs act offered something that was good for the american people or bad for the american people.
Obviously, there's always going to be some winners and losers.
So, a little bit of background: this was a twenty-eleven stimulus bill proposed by president obama to fund job training, unemployment insurance and tax reductions.
It included tax increases for the wealthy and cuts to payroll taxes which are paid by every american who works and it was focused on creating so called shovel-ready jobs by promoting infrastructure and other types of large-scale building projects.
So, we have two arguments in favor of the american jobs act: the first is about good spending, so to speak.
Obviously, the american government spends lots of money frivolously, but we think that this would have been a really good way for the american government to spend money back in twenty-eleven.
First of all, interest rates were historically low at the time, effectively zero, which means that the government could borrow lots and lots of money and not pay any interest on it.
This is the perfect time to engage in some large-scale spending, of course, because it's cheaper than borrowing money at a time when interest rates are higher and you're going to be paying a lot of interest on it.
It's similar to getting a personal credit card with an introductory zero percent rate.
That's the time when you want to spend money, not later when it's going to collect twenty percent interest.
Furthermore, infrastructure is a good investment because it has a long-term value.
If you build an airport now and you borrow money at zero percent, you're going to be using that airport for fifty, sixty years, even longer, the airport in boston goes back before world war two, and so you're going to keep using that airport long after the debt is paid off.
So, at that point the airport is going to be debt-free and you're going to get an excellent amount of value for your money at this particular time.
But moreover, this is good spending because it helps some of the neediest americans, namely those with little education.
Back in twenty-eleven when we had very little economic growth and the financial crisis was quite recent, those who hadn't gone to college, who didn't have a lot of opportunity, were really struggling to get jobs because things like building that had employed lots of them fell off after the housing crisis.
So, this would've been spending targeted to help some americans who really needed help from the government at that time.
And what's more, we think that this type of spending would encourage secondary private spending which would lead to economic growth.
If you spend a lot of money to build an airport or a train station, then businesses are going to open up nearby to serve that airport or whatever you may be building and businesses are going to open up to serve the people working on the project and ultimately, you're going to encourage economic growth which is what stimulus is all about.
Not just spending money, but encouraging private people to spend money and thus, get the economy growing again.
So, our second point is that we think that the tax adjustments that were part of the american jobs act are fundamentally fair and necessary.
So, a payroll tax in america is a tax that's a flat rate, say, ten percent, on every single person's paycheck every month that gets taken out and goes to things like social security for elderly people.
Meanwhile, the wealthy in america pay some of the lowest rates of tax of any group of people in highly developed countries.
The income tax is not terribly progressive and capital gains tax, which is the tax paid on investment, is very very low in the united states.
So, what we see is that there's a fairly high flat tax on income for everybody and relatively low taxes on the kind of money that wealthy people have.
We think that this is unfair, particularly in times of economic stress, like twenty-eleven.
The increased marginal value of another dollar is much lower to a wealthy person than a poor person, because for a poor person, that might be the difference between paying your bills this month and, for a wealthy person, it's the difference between a yacht or a slightly larger yacht.
So, we can see that we want the wealthy to pay more taxes relative to their income than the low-income people because the money doesn't mean as much to them.
Therefore, we need to shift the tax burden away from the or away from low-income people and onto the wealthy and the american jobs act would have done just that.
So, for these reasons, we think it would have brought more good than harm.
Thank you."
"In places where trans fat has been banned already there's been steep decline in hospital admissions for heart attacks and strokes.
We think, ladies and gentlemen, that that in and of itself is compelling evidence in favor of the motion we should ban trans fat usage in food.
The health risks that are linked with trans fat include coronary artery disease, diabetes, obesity, liver dysfunction, infertility in women, and more but most people don't know that.
Most people don't know that there's a definitive link between those diseases and trans fat and most people don't know to check the packages of the foods that they eat to look for trans fat or how to look for trans fat.
We think, ladies and gentleman, that trans fat is so present in so many of the processed foods that we eat it's cheap, it increases shelf stability of products but it's harming our society and it is the duty of the government to put an end to it and ban trans fat usage in foods in order to reduced the health risks to people.
The government has a clear duty to protect our health.
We think that it is unfair and unrealistic to expect lay people to keep up with all of the scientific and medical discoveries that are being made on a daily basis in our world.
We think that over the course of just a few decades for example, cigarettes went from being something that was prescribed by doctors to increase health to being banned everywhere and because of their health risks.
That's kind of society that we live in today.
Mere decades can can can change something from being prescribed by doctors to being banned anywhere in public.
We think, ladies and gentlemen, that this shows that it's very difficult for people to keep up with scientific discoveries.
It's difficult for doctors themselves.
So who do people rely on today?
When it comes to food we rely on the FDA standards to protect us.
When we stand in front of a shelf in the supermarket we say to ourselves anything that is on the shelf has been approved by the FDA FDA and it's safe for me to eat but trans fats are clearly harming society.
There's a clear link with diseases that are on the rise and there's a clear decrease of these of these diseases and a decrease in heart attacks and strokes where the trans fats have been have been banned from foods already and so we think, ladies and gentleman, that that the FDA and the government have a duty to protect people by banning the use of this deadly ingredient and it's their duty to make sure that people know that there that there is to take that step instead of people, instead of relying on people to stay up to date with this medical information themselves.
We also think, ladies and gentlemen, that when trans fat is put into processed foods, when it's used in processed foods, it is often paired with things that are quite addictive.
Things like chocolate.
Other types of ingredients they're put into foods where people have trouble stopping eating them.
They are cheap foods like french fries, like oreos.
Cheap snacks that we can get on the go and that that we feel is nourishing us and giving us energy even though obviously it's doing more harm than good.
We think that that's a huge problem.
We think that when we're allowed not only to use it in foods but to put it in coupled with foods that are the cheapest foods available on the market and often those that have addictive qualities because they're being paired with other things like caffeine, chocolate, et cetera, we think that that's extra problematic in somewhere where the government has to step in and say no.
This is not allowed.
We're going to take it out of foods.
We're going to protect people from the diseases that are that is plaguing our society so that everyone benefits from a healthier society.
We think it's in the government's interest to do so because it means a healthier society.
We think it's in the government's interest because it has less health insurance payouts and at the end of the day, it has less less taxing on the hospital system, less taxing on doctors.
We think that it's simply a duty that it has first and foremost to protect the citizens of their citizens of the country.
Thank you very much."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should increase the use of personal medications.
We see this as like more money into personal medical techniques, more disease mapping, redirection of hospital resources to focus on the mapping of individuals genomes to track where you can personally interject preventative care.
With that, three main areas of clash.
First on changing the approach to healthcare.
We think that there is has always been tension between preventative care and care for like once the diseases already occurred.
And the tension isn't that like people disagree about which is preferable.
Everybody understands that preventative care is always cheaper, more effective, and less invasive dash dangerous to the individual than care once the person is already sick.
The disagreement occurs over whether one is possible, and oftentimes we see that preventative care is impossible because it's just really difficult to predict what conditions a person is likely to get.
This changes when you are able to use personal medications to track out an individual's genome, predict what they are likely to have, and then assemble a personalized treatment plan based on that.
So we think that what happens on our side of the house is that you're going to have a much more preferable approach where individuals are unlikely to have to suffer through the condition in the first place.
This means that we're not going to have any of the physical pain, but you also avoid the cost to productivity that occurs when people aren't able to work because of the fact that they are having a condition, when people like when friends and family are like impacted by a person who is sick.
And so we think that all of this is really important, because the difference is very simple.
Once I already have cancer, I have to undergo things like chemotherapy, I have to often have like invasive surgeries.
This takes me out of the workforce, it takes me out of my family, it risks my life, and it causes me a lot of pain.
Compare this to a world in which we could predict that there are certain factors that are likely to make you have cancer, then we're able to manipulate those factors.
IE have a personalized plan in which you have a certain set of nutrients that you take per day, or preventative medication, things like that.
And we think that in that world, because you're not suffering as much all at once, you don't have to leave any of those fears that you've ingratiated yourself into.
We also think that it doesn't contribute to drug resistance in the same way, because it would ultimately eliminate that need for like antibiotics to happen after you have a sickness.
You'd be able to cut down on hospital beds per like hospital, so like more efficient use of resources, and it would be really good for the broader population in that you'd be able to identify diagnoses a lot earlier and treat it more effectively.
So you'd be able to avoid medications that don't work or would cause adverse reactions.
Our second area of clash is about benefiting broader research.
Because recognize that when we personalize medical care, we necessarily take down a lot of personal data about that individual.
Oftentimes we take down what genes they have, we map their genome, and this makes it really easy to trace population trends in disease.
So you're able to see dispositions broken down based on demographics, based on biological characterizations, and when you aggregate this data within a research sphere, this makes it a lot easier to do things like identify diseases that are linked to different kinds of genes, or identify like like likelihood of getting a certain condition based on certain factors.
This allows us to essentially map probabilities which makes more efficient treatment in the future and it's good for research.
Our third area of clash is about health care costs and keeping them low.
Recognize that personalized medication streamlines drug development which makes it a lot cheaper.
Because you have a lot less of the traditional trial and error, you're able to more efficiently target the specific issues that are mapped across populations.
It's always cheaper to do preventative care or early care rather than full on treatment later as well, because the things are oftentimes a lot less invasive.
Like the chemotherapy cocktail alone costs upwards of like thousands and thousands of dollars, but being on a certain health care regime is usually a lot cheaper.
Proud to propose."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should close guantanamo bay.
Three independent points: first is human rights.
So, the way that inmates are treated at guantanamo bay is pretty gruesome, to say the least.
It's an area where there's like a significant amount of torture within the jail.
There's , you know, deprivation of basic human rights, like food and water.
There're, you know, large amounts of reports of sexual assault within the prison.
This is not a this is not a place that is operates within the UN convention on human rights, to say the least.
I think that the human rights afforded to prisoners are pretty important regardless of what they have done, for one, they have allegedly done these things.
So I think this treatment is definitely not warranted under the assumptions of innocent until proven guilty.
But secondly, even if they have committed crimes, there are still certain rights that we afford to inmates, even from foreign countries, on the basis that regardless of the crimes they've committed, they are still humans.
They still experience suffering.
These are still people who do not needlessly need to be inflicted harm upon, especially if they are being kept in a high security prison where there is little likelihood of them escaping and committing more harm down the road.
The second independent point is propaganda.
So, I think that the way that gitmo is run, that is, like such an egregious den of human rights violations, paints a very vivid picture for people , specifically in the middle east, where a lot of the detainees are from, that radical groups like, say, al qaeda or , you know, isis, et cetera, are able to paint the west as very inhumane and hostile towards them specifically by using gitmo as an example, by saying this is how I how they treat us, not even the ones that are like convicted of crimes, just the ones that are accused, and this makes for effective propaganda.
To be clear, this isn't the only thing the US government does that makes for good propaganda, but it is certainly one of many elements that factors into a web or a narrative of ways in which , you know, people in the middle east are shown how the US government operates and are then, you know, shown to despise it based on the human rights violations committed by the US government.
In the long term then, I think this really infringes upon our capacity to, you know, meaningfully undermine the support for groups, like al qaeda and isis, because their support is so predicated upon the human rights abuses that we are currently committing.
Our third independent point is basically relations with cuba.
So, the location of gitmo is precarious, to say the least.
It's on a small bit of annexed land, on cuba, that we've held, I believe, since the sixties or so.
This is a problem for a couple reasons.
The first is the cost of operating a prison so far away, and a location that's, you know, not very happy with the fact that we're operating there.
Going to cuba is expensive, shipping supplies to cuba is expensive, ensuring that the military presence around the prison is strong enough, not just to keep them inmates in, but also to keep the cuban government from taking back their land is also expensive.
There are a lot of reasons why this is a poor use of money.
But secondly, it actually harms our relationship with cuba at a time where we're trying to remedy this.
, you know, under the obama administration, certainly, there were a lot of steps taken to ensure that we could have closer relations with cuba.
, generally speaking, possitive relations with any country is a good thing because it mitigates the likelihood of, you know, some sort of outbreak of violence or even a trade war.
But with cuba specifically, we wanted to mollify this relationship because of their proximity to us, that it's bad to have enemies in your neighbor in your backyard.
However, guantanamo bay is really an aggravating point between the two countries because it represents an annexation by the united states, that this is really cuban land that we have just sort of taken and decided to run a high security military prison on.
This, of course, is problematic for our relationship so benefit certainly taking out the prison would include better relations with cuba.
Proud to propose."
"The one-child policy brought more good than harm.
In this debate, we don't intend to defend or deal with horrific phenomena that happened in china, such as forced abortions or killing of female babies.
These are atrocious and undefendable, but not a necessary outcome of the one-child policy.
We are totally in favor of educating and enforcing a smart use of protective measures and to provide abortion services when and if needed in order to make sure this isn't a common thing.
The sanction that we refer to as to breaking this policy is a heavy and deterring fine, according to one's level of income, but nothing more pervasive than that.
We believe that the heart of this debate deals with the question of whether it's justified for the law to intervene in decisions regarding the size of one's family.
We'll have three we have two arguments, sorry.
A: what constitutes a justified law, and b: why slowing down the birth rate is essential for the survival of the chinese society.
So, first argument.
We believe that every law is essentially a crime against the citizens that have to abide by it.
Somebody decided for these citizens, without asking their opinion, that something's forbidden and if they do so, they'll be severely punished.
The law is therefore, by definition, evil, only sometimes it's a necessary evil.
The rationale behind the law system is that even though the laws are restrictive, without them we'll be a lot more restricted.
Even though the law limits my actions by forbidding me to hit other people, for instance, this is what guarantees that I am protected from the beatings of others.
Therefore, the relevant question is never the level of intervention.
A justified law isn't a law that intervenes as less as possible, but one that brings upon a better situation, in terms of freedoms, than without it.
Without a doubt, the one-child policy is massively intervening in the lives of the citizens.
But we need to note that in in special circumstances, we're willing to severely harm people's freedoms to serve the better good.
For instance, by tapping phones and surveilling terrorists, we are infringing their privacy rights for the sake of national security, and we think that that is fine.
Bottom line: the mere fact that this policy is intrusive doesn't automatically render it unjustified.
We have to examine whether there's a bit there's a big enough utility from this policy that can justify it, and that's exactly what we're gonna do now.
So, why is this essential for the chinese society?
Like most populous countries in the world, the booming of the population in the chinese society in the previous century has risen to practically unsustainable levels.
Unchecked and uncontrolled, the birth rate kept on rapidly growing exponentially, leading to devastating outcomes.
In the macro level, the job market was flooded.
There were simply too many people joining the market all at once, all the time, in order for there to be sufficient employment for everyone.
Public services came crashing down.
Schools couldn't keep up with the amount of children.
Hospitals didn't have enough beds, not to mention doctors or medicines.
Environmentally speaking, the density created huge ecological problems and a heavy pollution that exacerbated the health problems, and so the overload overload on hospitals increased further.
This is a vicious cycle.
In the micro level, millions of families became subjected to severe poverty, because there were too many mouths to feed and too little food or resources to take care of that, mostly in rural areas.
The one-child policy that came into effect in the late seventies was able to, like to an extent, reverse this trend in chinese birth rate.
Alongside the economic reforms china has led, this brought three or four decades of prosperity that lifted many families from the circle of poverty.
Had it not been for the one-child policy, would have been extremely difficult for china to avoid the economic disaster that it was trapped in and, in all likelihood, it would have just crumbled under a crushing debt.
In conclusion, had chinese citizens been allowed to bring to the world as many children as they like, chances are these children would have been born to pretty miserable lives and, at the same time, sentence their entire families to a life of poverty and eventually dooming the entire chinese society.
All in all, given the extraordinary circumstances in china, we believe that this policy leads to the maximization of freedoms and therefore, we should support it."
"We should close landfills.
On our side of the house, we think that traditional landfills are very wasteful and not desirable and, therefore, that they should be closed down.
When possible, we'd like to clean them up and restore them to a cleaner, more natural state, and when not possible, we'd still like to prevent them from being further used.
With this in mind, we have three arguments on our side.
The first is that landfills can create a permanent blight on society.
Many landfills are absolutely full of plastic that will not degrade for hundreds of years or massive amounts of trash that can't decompose because of the environment of a landfill.
As a result, you end up with these areas where you have giant hills full of trash that cover large amounts of space.
We think that no one will ever be able to live there again, that people don't want to be in that area and that, ultimately, this creates a permanent blight on a given community.
When there's a landfill in a town, that's space that can never be reclaimed and that's an area that is always going to be seen as lesser, and many people will look down on an entire city just because it happens to have a landfill in that area.
So it's not just a blight on the land but also a blight on the society and the community as well, because of the ideas people have about where landfills are placed.
So we think that that's unfair to that area and, therefore, that we ought abandon the use of landfills.
Our second argument is that they're unhealthy for the people who live around them.
So not only are these shameful for certain people, but also you get pollution of ground water, you get unhealthy animals, you get all of these other issues that arise from landfills being present.
For instance, many times medications or heavy metals are improperly disposed of and, as a result, you end up with pollution of ground water in a way that can cause birth defects or other problems for children in the surrounding community.
Sometimes landfills are covered up and improperly built on, and people get sick or injured because of that.
So we think that there's actually many harms that can accrue to a given community.
The reason why I think this is unacceptable is because it's foisting everyone's problem off to a small group of people.
Usually what happens when we build a landfill is people say, "" oh, it's fine, we'll just put it in this small town.
No one really cares about them, "" and that town gets overridden by the rest of society.
But no one would put up with having a landfill in their neighborhood if they were able to avoid it.
So this usually means foisting everyone else's trash off on those who are least able to advocate for themselves, so oftentimes ethnic minorities or very poor people who aren't able to protest effectively against getting a landfill.
We think it's unacceptable to dump all of society's problems on the people who can least afford to deal with the impacts that it has on their health and on their community and that because landfills are never going to be placed fairly in wealthy neighborhoods, because those people will always be able to resist it, we think that it's just unacceptable to place landfills at all.
If there's no good way to do something, maybe you just shouldn't do it at all.
And our last argument is that this would encourage a lot more recycling.
If people had to pay to dispose of their own trash in other ways, we think that people would be much more fastidious about recycling anything they could.
On our side, we think that almost all plastic and metal will end up going to recycling because people won't have to come up with other ways to dispose of it.
Not only that, if it started costing money for people to dispose of their non-recyclable goods, we think that many people would choose to purchase things that were packaged or were made of recyclable goods instead, and that, as a result, you would actually see much less production of true waste in our society and a much greater recapture of goods through recycling, and that this would have a long-term virtuous cycle of leading to less and less pollution and less and less environmental degradation.
For all of these reasons, we should close landfills.
Thank you."
"We should legalize doping in sports.
To clarify, we'll stand for the legalization of performance-enhancing drugs that aren't psychoactive or addictive, namely, steroids and the likes of it.
In the first argument, we'll explain why doping is part of the natural evolution of sports.
In the second argument, we'll counter some possible opposition claims and discuss the other effects of legalization.
Let's go to the first argument.
We believe that sports is a lot like art.
The main reason we care so much about it is that it inspires us.
Professional athletes serve as an example and a reminder for what beautiful things can be achieved with talent, hard work and discipline.
Therefore, the most important quality that sports need to entail to fulfill its purpose is to, first and foremost, be thrilling and moving and fun to watch.
True enough, there are additional elements that are fundamental to sports, for example, the competition element that symbolizes a friendly rivalry.
But the competition itself also serves, eventually, the higher purpose of inspiration because it helps push the athletes themselves to their limits, and it adds more interest and emotional attachment for the audience.
It's much like music competitions like the eurovision or american idol and so on.
The competition is merely a means to make the musical show more appealing to larger audiences.
We believe that the competition alone can never cut it if the sport itself isn't enthusiastic or exciting, hence, the difference between exciting sports, like football or basketball, that are incredibly popular and sports like, say, badminton that are significantly less thrilling and as a result, less popular.
So the most valuable trade a sport needs to possess to fulfill its purpose is to be beautiful and intriguing spectacle.
Why is all of this relevant?
Because we say it's not easy to maintain a thrilled audience for very long.
People lose interest in new fashions very quickly and in order to keep up and survive the modern age short attention span, sports has to keep changing and evolving for it and for that to happen, it's imperative that new records keep getting set all the time.
No one will be interested in the olympic games if we believe that no record could possibly be beat, that the best is behind us.
Notice how people keep drawing comparisons like is lebron bigger than michael, and so on.
So now we need to ask: how is it possible that new records keep getting set all the time?
Well, it's mostly due to the technology advancements advancements.
We kept making better running shoes so usain bolt is able to outrun his predecessors, better swimwear so michael phelps can do the amazing things that he does but eventually, there is a limit to how much further technology can take us and we're nearing this limit.
Doping is exactly the thing that could take us to the next level and save sports from stagnation.
Just like computers and technology have taken over the art world, and modern artists adapted and came up with ways to embrace this change and use it to complement their art, and not replace it, the same thing needs to happen with doping in sports.
Now let's counter some classic opposition arguments.
So, some might be worried about the negative health effects that come from using these substances.
To them we say that being a professional athlete is probably one of the least healthy things that one can do choose to do, with an incredibly high risk of getting injured.
If they really are worried about the athlete's health, they might as well ban sports altogether.
Some argue that sports all that sports is all about being natural, and it's the artificialness of these drugs that defeat the purpose of sports.
To them we say that for decades now, there's been nothing natural about the way professional athletes prepare for their competitions.
They go on elaborate diets, they use all kinds of food supplements.
In fact, we urge the opposition to explain what's the difference between protein supplements and steroids.
Now some argue that the difference that the different levels of accessibility to such drugs can harm the fairness of the competition.
Well, for one thing, differences in budget are already severely harming the fairness the fairness in the status quo.
Better-funded sports clubs get better athletes, better trainers, better sports gear.
There is no way around that.
Secondly, we think that legalization, if anything, will have the opposite effect, because in the status quo many athletes still use doping illegally.
Case in point, the story of the russian delegation to the two thousand sixteen olympic games.
But some of them are able to get away with it, while others aren't.
Making it legal and accessible can help level the playing field.
For all of these reasons, please propose."
"We should legalize polygamy.
So, just so everyone's clear what we're talking about in this debate.
We think that in countries where polygamy is currently illegal, such as the united states, britain, canada, that these countries should stop prosecuting people for polygamy, should add it to the books as something legal if they need to do so because of a civil code, or get rid of a law that prevents it if they have common law, all that.
But on top of that, by polygamy we mean the practice of someone taking more than one spouse.
We're okay with this being one husband with many wives, one wife with many husbands, or if that district would otherwise allow it, you could also have same sex polygamists marriages, we're fine with that if it would otherwise be legal in that country.
So yes in the united states, no in germany, for instance.
So, with that in mind, we have three arguments today.
The first is that banning polygamy is tantamount to religious discrimination.
Recognize that the reason why polygamy has been banned in countries like the united states or britain is because there's a strong norm against polygamy in certain christian denominations.
We see that the catholic church, for instance, has preached against polygamy for hundreds and hundreds of years, and that catholic countries overwhelmingly, perhaps all of them, ban polygamy.
We think that first of all, it's unfair for countries to make law based on religious norms.
We think that individuals should be free to choose to follow or not to follow these religious laws.
First of all, if people don't have a real choice about following a religious custom, then they're probably not actually doing anything to fulfill their spiritual obligations, but on top of that we think that, for instance, if you are a muslim living in a predominantly catholic country, you should still be able to practice polygamy because that's acceptable within the confines of your own faith.
A good example of this is why polygamy was banned in the united states.
Some of you may know that mormonism is a religion which originated in america and which encouraged, until very recently, its followers to practice polygamy.
So the united states banned polygamy, and used it as a way to prosecute mormons as a religious minority throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth century.
Mormon leaders eventually changed their rules in order to end persecution by the american government.
But we think that this is completely unjust, and that if people wish to practice polygamy due to a certain religious obligation, that they should be free to do so, in the same way that people are free to practice anything else religious that doesn't harm others.
Our second argument is that polygamy is a victimless crime.
In general, we think that government should only intervene in people's personal freedom to limit it, when there are actually going to be third party harms.
We think that, for instance, it's okay to ban smoking because secondhand smoke puts other people at risk of lung cancer.
It's okay to ban theft because you don't have a right to take other people's things.
But we don't see any real harm to polygamy.
Why is this true?
So in order for people to get married they have to enter into a contract, which means that they can't be coerced because presumably they're going to have to go before a judge and say that they weren't coerced, in order to get this marriage contract.
Rules like the minimum age for getting married are still going to exist, so we're not worried about young women being pressured by older men into polygamous marriages, like some people might say would happen.
We think that everyone will have to follow all other existing laws.
So at that point, there's no real harm because people are consenting into this, and it ought be permitted to maximize personal freedom.
Our third argument is that bans on polygamy are unenforceable.
Why is this true?
So in a country like the US, where it has strict laws against polygamy and has had them for over a hundred years, we see that there's still no way to stop people from living in a polygamous fashion.
Lots of people never go down to city hall to get a marriage certificate or whatever you may do in other countries, they just choose to live as husband and wife, treat each other like such.
We see that marriage is predominantly a social and religious phenomenon, and not a government one.
At that point, you can't stop people from having polygamous marriages in a religious or social setting, so there's ultimately no reason to ban it from a legal perspective, because you can't prevent the actions in themselves, only the state recognition of those actions.
So at the end of the day, we think we should legalize polygamy in order to end religious discrimination, because it's a victimless crime, and because the law is unenforceable.
Thank you."
"We should ban organic food.
So in the status quo, in places like the united states and the european union you have government entities that label some food which is produced according to a long list of guidelines as organic.
So the only way that you're allowed to call your food organic is if you go down the sort of government checklist and meet every requirement and they presumably test your food to ensure that you do so.
So what we're arguing for on our side of debate is to get rid of this official label of organic for any given food.
Instead, we think that consumers should be able to read if something is produced according to certain natural methods, but that the actual term organic should not be used.
And certainly, nothing should replace it that's a similar government label that's indicative of this type of quality.
So three arguments.
The first is about why we think that organic labels drive up food costs.
So we tell you that it's much more lucrative to sell food to people who have more disposable income rather than less.
We see that, for instance, there are probably people in san francisco who can afford to pay a lot of money for a bag of rice, and people living in oakland who can pay a lot less money for a bag of rice, so you would always want to be the person producing for those wealthier consumers.
Now, the organic label is an excellent way to get someone to pay more money for effectively the same product.
We tell you that going down this checklist doesn't actually mean that you've done that much differently, just that you've avoided certain chemicals and likely substituted in other chemicals instead.
This may sound a little bit cynical, but most organic food is not coming straight from, you know, your grandfather's farm, it's coming from a massive agribusiness that's just as manipulative is any other food company so we tell you that because it's more lucrative you get fewer alternatives, because stores also want to stock the most profitable foods, which means these organic foods.
So they're taking up space that would otherwise go to regular, cheaper foods.
At that point I think that you get higher prices for the same foods, and that this is unacceptable because this makes it more difficult for people to have food security in their community.
Our second argument is about why we think this label is fundamentally misleading, and I suppose I've already hinted at this a little bit.
So there are no proven health benefits to so called organic food, and this makes a lot of sense when you think about what it actually is.
The USTA in america, or the EC in europe, basically just say you can't use any chemical on this list, and you have a few other requirements for how you store and treat this food.
So it doesn't make any sense that it would have any health benefits given that you're effectively eating the same thing minus a few safe chemicals that have already been approved for use in food these foods have the same nutritional value.
Now, it might be the case that one farmer has a strain of tomato with a little bit more vitamin a than another farmer strain of tomato, but at the end of the day these differences are insignificant when you account for the natural variation between foods because they're a product of nature.
We think therefore that this label is misleading because it exists to mislead consumers.
Basically, the companies that produce this organic food, these large companies like tyson and other agribusinesses, are implying to customers that organic food is healthier and more nutritious.
And even if they don't lie in their advertising, this seems apparent based on how people understand the word organic.
So we think that there's an imbalance in access to information between consumers and companies.
The companies know that the food is the same nutritionally as any other food, but the consumer thinks that they're getting something better.
At that point we feel like the government needs to step in and ban the use of this label because consumers are effectively being taken advantage of and can't protect themselves from these predatory businesses.
Our last argument is about why we think that the organic food label is actually harmful to small farmers.
So because this list is pretty long and requires you to use more expensive chemicals to grow your plants, or to raise livestock in particular, we think that most small farmers actually can't afford to meet these sort of arbitrary regulations for the organic label.
What is that mean?
Now, they can't compete in the gourmet food market, which we already told you is the most profitable food market, but on top of that, we think that they're likely to lose customers because people who probably would have bought produce at things like farmers markets and other places are now going to turn to other markets buying from large companies in order to get organic products thinking that it's healthier.
We think that many small farms will likely go under as they lose their consumer base, which is people with enough disposable income to buy from a small farm in the first place.
And this only strengthens and entrenches the power of large businesses.
And we think that this makes it likely that there will be less competition in the sphere of food production in the long run which ties back into what I told you earlier about driving up costs due to lack of competition.
So for these reasons, we should ban organic food."
"We should nationalize electricity generation.
I think the thing we need to recognize here is that this isn't a debate about whether or not electricity generation will be done in a way that is good, because we think that both the government and private companies are capable of doing the same exact process of electricity generation and distributing that electricity to who needs it.
If only because the government has absolute power to just contract a company that already does it in the status quo and just have them do the the process, but collect all of the money and make sure they are setting prices and doing all of that sort of stuff.
So what this is actually a debate about isn't necessarily about quality, but more about whether or not we think that it is the place of private corporations to be taking care of things that are as important as electricity generation for the general populace.
To main arguments, first on why basic services shouldn't be governed by the free market.
Recognize first and foremost the free market is incredibly discriminatory.
Like even though we have things like supply and demand that are supposed to drive prices down, recognize first that these things aren't absolute.
Right?
Like recognize that companies will want to make a profit either way.
So at some point on that supply and demand chain there's a trade off with quality in order to make the price decrease even further than like than than like maybe the demand is requiring or the supply is requiring.
What this means first and foremost, first, that electricity is demanded by literally everyone.
This means that regardless of how many companies there are, and we don't think they're going to be that many because in the status quo there simply aren't, like we have a couple of main ones and the lot of them are regional, so we actually just don't think they're going to be many options for people.
But those companies rely on charging individuals a price that will garner them a profit and if those people aren't capable of paying much either they don't get a service at all which recognize isn't that uncommon, there many people within the united states which don't have any electricity at all, or they start decreasing quality upon giving them electricity.
And we think that that's something the government just won't do.
Why?
Because first the government actually has an incentive to make sure that the individual is taken care of.
Because when someone doesn't have electricity and that forces them to not being able being able to like drink water or make food or they freeze in the winter, that's all stuff that rebounds on the government.
We think that without electricity people can't access not just the lights in their house, but we think the lights are important enough as it is, they also can literally risk freezing to death in the winter or dying of dehydration in the summer.
Like not having electricity, especially for someone who maybe uses electric pipes to carry their water upwards and things like that can really be a matter of life and death for citizens of this country.
And we think that the government needs to step in to make sure that electricity is provided at a reasonable price in an equitable manner.
And we think that the government is really the only body that has the incentive to go into areas that might be farther away, or less densely populated, or populated very densely but with people who are poorer, because the government is the one that needs to do things like get reelected or prevent people from uprising against it.
But our second argument is about creating incentives to deliver.
Because as we told you the government has a vested interest in the well being of the general populace.
Not just because as I told you the general populace is likely to rise up and overthrow them if they're not if they're not happy, but also because the people who aren't taken care of by the by like electricity oftentimes end up relying on the government.
So if I'm someone whose house has been cut off from electricity for weeks and weeks I'm more likely to end up requiring government housing or government like shelters and things like that.
And we think that's something the government does not want.
It's bad for the economy, it's bad for the individual and it's bad for the government.
We also just think that at the end of the day this is personally around about accountability.
It's really hard for common individuals to sue companies and get a good verdict.
Right?
Because companies have all this money they can spend a law teams and they have all and it's like very difficult for individuals to afford a lawyer to go up against them and things like that.
But the government, you can literally do things like start massive petitions against it, there are like nonprofits specifically created for this purpose.
Proud to propose."
"We should adopt a zero tolerance policy in schools.
So, firstly, we think that the policy would address things specifically like drugs and gun usage and violence, ensuring that images of the these things wouldn't be allowed on school property.
And, of course, if these things were ever found on school property, on someone's person, a weapon or drugs of any kind, they would be immediately suspended.
As far as the punishment that we think is appropriate, we think it would be a sliding scale based on, firstly, the degree that the offense was of, and secondly, whether or not it was a multi-time offender.
So if someone does something, like bring drug paraphernalia into a school, the first time they may receive a two-week suspension, the second time they may receive a longer suspension.
Finally, we think that if this is repeated offenses, expulsion is probably necessary.
We think that we don't want to include things that are that are not currently illegal in the status quo, because we think in those areas there should be discretion.
But recognize that in most of these instances, these types of things, the types of things that are promoted, whether it's by a tee shirt that promotes drug usage or images of violence and images of gun usage, we think it promotes these types of things on school property, these types of illegal things.
And as the school is an arm of the state, has an obligation to introduce individuals, specifically young people, to the norms of the state, to what is acceptable within the public sphere, we think that it's clear that the schools have an obligation to set a very firm message by introducing zero tolerance policies in such a way that it shows students, at a very young age, introduces them to those cultural norms that these things are generally not acceptable.
We think that certain things warrant this high level of scrutiny, because that aside from the fact that there's messaging that schools do, we think that it's also important because you want to ensure that there is a safe environment for the students that are learning there.
We think that the educational system is, first and foremost, meant to educate the young people that go through it and that if you don't provide them with a safe and non-hostile learning environment, we think that it's very difficult for individuals to achieve that goal, to do what they're meant to do when they go to these school systems.
We think that being surrounded by things like drugs and guns is something that is very clearly going to be impeding to their progress, to the individual's progress, within these school systems.
And given that this is the case, we think that you need to ensure that if these things ever show up, ever emerge in the school system, that they're immediately stamped out.
We also think that zero tolerance policies are more likely to deter people from doing these types of things.
We think that if it's the we think it's unlikely that most people are going to bring in things like guns to a school anyway, but we think it's possible that people will go into a school with drugs and oftentimes, they may go into schools with images of these things.
We think that if you send this message, you're far more likely to deter people, to ensure that these types of incidents that otherwise probably would have been punished anyway don't happen in the first place, which means that you don't need to take more punishment measures against more individuals.
It's a way of acting before these types of harms are done to ensure that people have the most safe and welcoming experience within the schools that they're found, within the schools that they find themselves.
We think that it's incredibly important that the students have this understanding and the safety and that they're deterred from doing these things.
We think, finally, that the safety of these students outweighs, so even if you think that there's some sort of harshness to these policies, that context is important, we think that by introducing these types of very stiff penalties, you're less likely to have the very rare occasions in which individuals may do things that could cause violence or could cause damage in these schools.
We think that by sending these messages you're less likely in the even if in it's in a minute set of instances, the harm that could be done in those instances is incredibly problematic.
We think that you'd rather take every step possible to divert those types of harms, especially in the instances of drugs and guns.
For these reasons, we should adopt zero tolerance policies in schools."
"We should abandon social media.
In this debate, we're going to present you with two main arguments as to why social media is a net harm in the world and why we shouldn't be using it.
The first is about social harms, and the second is about productivity harm.
So on the social harms: we think that the way that social media has risen up in our society is a way in which people have become largely immersed and dependent upon it, that people quantify their social relationships through social media, that people categorize them through social media and they understand them through social media, and that the vast majority of people, if they want to have a social a social relationship with someone, they need to be connected in some way with them through social media, otherwise people end up being left behind because they simply don't adopt the newest trends, the newest forms of communication, the newest mediums of interpersonal relationship, and this means you get left by the wayside.
So why do we think this is problematic?
We think that this clearly dampens interactions that happen in real life, between two physical people, because there's there's just a significant difference between the interaction you can have on social media and the interaction you have in real life.
Social media reactions are often much more vapid, for example, liking someone's post on facebook or retweeting something.
This is a very vapid interaction that doesn't prepare you to have a meaningful conversation, a meaningful building of a social relationship between you and another person.
There's also, for example, if you're messaging someone or commenting, these are things that are very different from trying to hold a conversation one on one.
And because people become dependent on social media, there's a tradeoff between them being skilled in that form of communication and the form of communication that allows you to be an interpersonal human being, relating with people on one on one situations.
We also think it quantifies interactions in a bad way.
People tend to prioritize meaningless things, such as likes and follows, overbuilding deep relationships with a few people.
And people that have only a hundred friends on facebook, or people that don't have a lot of posts or don't have a lot of retweets or interactions, all these things, these people are seen as outside of the norm and then people crave to be within the norm.
People crave to have that type of following, that type of social media presence.
But these aren't things that are intrinsically valuable.
These aren't things that provide meaning and strong relationships in someone's life in the same way that fostering a relationship in which you truly know another person, and you can talk to them about anything with a few people, can be truly meaningful and uplifting in a person's life.
We think that social media dampens those types of relationships, and we think that in those ways, it's problematic.
So, on to productivity harms, we think there are a few of them.
Firstly, because people end up posting things on social media that can literally never go away, we think that people are often denied job or other opportunities that can allow them to become more financially well-off, more socially well-off, and put them in a better stable situation in their life moving forward.
We think that by not using social media, you don't set yourself up to this kind of public disgrace, public embarrassment, that social media can often provide.
We also think that it is just a massive distraction.
In your free time, you could be doing this in you can be spending your free time in a number of other more productive ways.
You could spend it learning, you could learn it you could spend it being active, going outside, being a physical human being, or just building real physical connections with other people, and building memories.
These are things that you just don't do on social media.
And at work, these are also major distractions.
Things that cost millions of dollars on the like whole social market, or the whole marketplace, in a country when people are spending time at work that they otherwise are supposed to be spending being productive, doing their labor, spending it on social media.
Because it's harmful to both social interactions and productive capacities of people, we should abandon social media."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition for today's motion that cannabis should be legalized.
Three independent points: first, that it is a paternalistic policy to ban people from engaging in consensual actions, second, that legalization will decrease the power and the harms of black markets, and third, that implementation in the status quo has racist undertones.
First on paternalism.
It's important to recognize that, autonomy is a good in and of itself, that it is the fundamental right that we derive all others from.
The reason that we care about, for example, our right to life, is because we have the ability to do things with that life, so, going off of that, them, it's important that the baseline, that we attribute all policies by, is: does this allow people to do things, right?
The reason we don't like murder, or stealing, or things like that, is because it limits other people's ability to act within a way that actually makes their individual lives better.
So, it's important then that, when there's not externalities, we allow people to just make decisions for themselves, that they can consent into harm at so.
So it's important to recognize then, that if op gets up here and it says that this is a harmful drug, or it is something that creates harm to the individual, that's not enough of a reason for you to vote for op.
It's important to recognize that, the person has the right to engage in that action.
My second independent point is that block markets, in the status quo, are extremely harmful.
So, these exist already, right?
Things like cartels in mexico, things like even just street dealers in some suburb, exist already, and we crowd those out by legalization, because people prefer to buy in a market that has less risk.
You're less likely to be caught up in gang violence, you are less likely to be cheated out of your product, because there's no regulatory body to oversee the person engaging in a transaction with you.
People prefer to operate in the legal market, if it's an option.
So, what are the harms then, of the black market, that we get rid of by legalization?
Three independent: first, cartels, in and of themselves, create lots of violence.
When you have a black market, it is easy for powerful actors to grab up large shares of market, creating effective monopolies, that they protect those monopolies by use of violence.
This leads to huge amounts of death, it leads to mass amount of suffering.
Second is safety regulations.
It's important to note that like, when you have a black market, there's no one able to come into a production plant, and say you're not up to code, you're selling a product that is going to be harmful to people.
We should always prefer a world, where you have that regulatory capacity to step in, and say: this is an unsafe product, you are creating harm onto people by giving that product to them.
Third is access to children.
It's a lot easier for people that are probably not developmentally ready to consume this item, like the people that are most likely to be harmed by it, and the people that have the least information available then to meaningfully consent into it, are most likely going to be reached by the black market.
The reason why this is true is that, it's easy to crack down on the individual sellers, that are going around age age of sale laws like, for example, with alcohol, when you actually have a legal system, that can be regulated.
When this is not the case with a black market, it' this is why it's, like, easier for kids to get pot than it is for them to get alcohol.
So, the people, that are most vulnerable then, are more likely to be subjected to harm, in a world where the black market rules.
My third independent point is racism, and how specifically the implementation of the current law uses a tool of oppression primarily against african american communities.
Is important to recognize that, this isn't a law that's applied equally.
This is a law that is generally used to put large amounts of black men into prison, and largely used as an excuse for other things.
Things, like possession of small amounts of marijuana, can become a front for engaging in a as a means of arresting someone for something fairly unrelated, something like a traffic stop.
People cops will, like, search cars for drugs, in order to justify the arrest, things like that.
So, it's important to get rid of this tool that is used to put down black males in the status quo, and open up, like, our laws in a way that is much more reasonable.
Proud to propose."
"Sex education should be mandatory.
So in this debate, I think that we're talking about sex education, things like condom use, teaching children about pregnancy, how to avoid STD's, things like that.
And we're talking about this in state run schools.
So, when we say mandatory, we think that, you know, this would be a class, probably offered in health, or gym class, at a school.
So two big arguments for you, but they're both about individual health.
So before we get into those two arguments, I just want to say that, we think that the state has a compelling interest in better individual health.
Young people, who are healthy, are going to be better workers in the future, so the hope to grow the economy, if it's a developing country, they're going to help your country to develop.
And on top of that, since states ultimately pay for health care, through things like national health in britain, we think that, ultimately the state has a compelling interest to limit its expenses, with regard to sexual health.
Two big arguments then, the first is about how this limits teen pregnancies.
We think that, most teen pregnancies are ultimately caused by ignorance.
Young people who don't understand how teen pregnancy actually works, because they haven't been educated by their parents, who might be conservative or religious, or even parents who don't fully understand sexual health on their own, because they weren't educated in the past.
So, we think that many young women, in particular, are really grossly harmed, because they have unprotected sex, they don't understand the risks of getting pregnant, and then suddenly they have a child, and their community wants them to drop out of school, and raise that child, so ultimately, their education gets put on hold, they've a hard time getting a good job, and their future earnings are greatly decreased, their ability to you know go on to improve their own standard of living of their family standard of living is really decreased.
We see that, this has huge impacts on these people, especially teenage girls, as a result of teenage pregnancy.
But, it's relatively easy to educate people about how to avoid pregnancy.
You know, everything that you learned in school, especially condom use I think, is going to be important here.
Many young people, even in very developed countries like the US, their parents don't teach them anything about condom use, they might know that condoms exist, but perhaps they don't understand how to safely apply them, or when to use them.
So ultimately, teen pregnancies, that are easily prevented through condom use, are not going to be prevented, and that's to say nothing about forms of birth control, that young woman might not even know exist.
A lot of them probably know about the pill in developed countries, but in many developing countries, they might just be completely ignorant of the pill's existence.
And in the US, they may have a lot of stereotypes, or misinformation from the media about it, that would limit their ability to get on something, that could really help them to take control of their own life, not only with regards to pregnancy, but also with regard to regulating menstruation.
Ultimately we think that, you really empower young women as a result of sexual education.
Our second argument then is about how this limits STD's.
So, everybody today is very concerned about the spread of HIV and aids, and if we look at the regions where HIV has spread the most rapidly, it's in areas with very limited sexual education.
If you look at it in the US, it's been mostly in the gay community that, people been really affected by this awful disease.
The reason why that's probably true, is that schools, even up, unfortunately, until the present, don't teach young people about homosexual sexual education.
They only focus on heterosexual sexual education, which means that young people aren't informed about how to avoid getting an STD, they don't know that they need to use condoms, and things like that, with homosexual intercourse.
So ultimately, we think that, sex ed should be mandatory to limit the spread of STD's, not only, you know obviously, nobody wants an STD, but especially things like HIV, they can actually be life threatening in the future, and obviously they'd run up a huge cost for the government, in the forms of treatment.
So, because we better stop teen pregnancies, and empower young women, and because we limit the spread of HIV, sex education should be mandatory, thank you."
"We should ban breast implants.
We're going to bring you two arguments for our side today.
The first is that this is ultimately going to create an unnecessary pressure, especially on young women, when we have breast implants around, and second is a concern about the long-term safety and viability of breast implants.
So, that said, our first argument is that there is an increased social pressure for women to be conventionally attractive because of the existence of breast implants.
A hundred years ago or even thirty years ago, there was just nothing that someone could do about their bust size.
So there was no way that they could actually augment or change this feature about themselves, and it seems likely to me that people were more understanding of the fact that some people may have a larger or smaller bust size in a world where people had no control over it.
However, in a world where there is surgery available that can increase or decrease someone's breast size, ultimately we think it's likely that people will expect others to undergo this type of surgery.
And now, an opponent might say that this just isn't true and no one has these expectations, but it certainly is true that, first of all, women are unfairly expected to look a certain way regardless of their own background or genetics, and second of all, that there's been a huge rise in cosmetic surgeries in recent years.
If you look at k-pop stars as a good example of this, many female k-pop stars have huge amounts of cosmetic surgery so that they can fit a particular mold of what the record labels and recording studios want their stars to look like.
And no matter how talented they are, the only way that they can work is to fit into this mold of what a k-pop star is meant to look like.
In the united states, we don't see this as much today, but I do think that we're moving in a direction where more and more people get cosmetic surgery and where they get it at a younger and younger age.
So, ultimately, because of the coercive forces that surround women, especially young women in our society, where they're treated as sexual objects more so than people, it's likely that people will be coerced into getting these breast implants.
And we think that that's really harmful because if people are being coerced into getting these cosmetic surgeries, they take on a lot of risks and harms to their health and also to their own self-image and their esteem.
And for people who can't access breast implants or cosmetic surgeries, whether for cost or personal or religious reasons, ultimately these people are going to feel even worse about themselves than they might in a world where these didn't exist, because the pressure to have this certain appearance will be even stronger.
Our next argument is about the long-term safety and viability of breast implants.
We think that, unfortunately, it's unlikely that breast implants are going to be safe and effective in the long term.
As people get older, naturally, their bodies change and, ultimately, these breast implants fail to adapt as one gets older.
So even if you had a very high quality silicon implant that remained very good in quality throughout a person's life, it still wouldn't be able to adapt to the changes in their body as they get older.
So it's likely that this won't just be one surgery to add the implant, but likely a sequence of surgeries over the course of one's life to adjust it as your body ages and changes with time.
So this is going to be a pretty significant amount of time that people spend getting these surgeries and recovering from them and also a pretty significant investment in capital, and we think that people are being misled about this right now.
They've been told, "" oh, there were problems with old breast implants, but the new ones won't have these problems, "" but until we get to the point where these breast implants have been implemented long enough that we have lots of data, we just have no way of knowing whether they're going to be safe in the long term or what follow-up surgeries will be needed in the long term.
So people are being fed bad information and, ultimately, aren't able to make a good decision because of that bad information.
So because of the pressure this creates on women, especially young women, and because of the likelihood of long-term problems, we should ban breast implants.
Thank you."
"We should end the use of economic sanctions because they're ineffective and they ultimately only hurt the people themselves and they don't actually hurt or change the policies of the people in power.
So let's start by why sanctions are an ineffective means and they only just hurt people.
So, for starters, they're designed to change the actions of leaders.
Oftentimes they're targeting autocrats or dictators or single party governments.
They're oftentimes not targeting democratic societies or at least when western countries use them.
And this is important because this means you're trying to attack single leaders or unelected groups in power that are, in a lot of ways, unaccountable.
So these people aren't really going to actually struggle when you put economic sanctions on them.
These people who are occupying immense degrees of privilege because they literally control entire countries are always going to have access to black markets and they're always going to have access to other actors who are similarly sanctioned.
So you put sanctions on north korea, it does trade with china.
You put sanctions on russia, it can do trade with like anyone else maybe iran or something.
You put sanctions on iran, it can do trade with russia and north korea.
You put sanctions on cuba, it can do trade with literally anyone else in the world.
You put sanctions on venezuela, you're in the same boat.
Pretty much like any country that you put sanctions on it's always going to have access to other countries.
And that's a big problem because it's an inherent loophole in the way sanctions work.
Sanctions only work if literally everybody is cooperating, if everybody is on the same page.
And this is something that almost never happens because there's always going to be disagreements in the ideologies that are underpinning the the use of the sanction in the first place.
So you're probably not going to be all that effective.
What is going to be effective?
The ability of the average person in that country to access goods and services.
So while US sanctions on a place like venezuela or cuba isn't actually going to affect the people at the very top, it's probably going to at minimum make the cost of goods more expensive because it's maybe going to have to come from actors that are farther away, actors that don't have the ability to produce things as cheaply, etcetera.
Maybe there's also certain kinds of goods and services that are uniquely produced by america or could be like done cheaper for america by america or other kinds of countries that are putting the sanctions on you and that's going to be a struggle.
So for example, you see in places like venezuela where there's a huge shortage of all kinds of supplies because american companies that supply a vast majority of like products to the world whether it's like like sanitary supply like procter and gamble, johnson and johnson, like things that like basic things like that which are essentially not available in places like venezuela.
Cause you put sanctions on them or inability to access like say american products.
That's not going to hurt the people at the very top, it's going to hurt people on the ground.
Same in north korea, when you make it so that there's no businesses in north korea, I don't think kim jong un's life is going to get any worse, he's going to do whatever the hell he wants.
Who's going to be hurt is the people whose economy is going to be a whole lot worse.
And that brings me to the next argument about why sanctions are ineffective.
I think that they're only going to serve to make the people's lives worse and they're going to look at the people who are making their lives worse, namely the west or the person who's putting the sanction on them in the first place, and this is only going to further support for the government in the first place.
Because oftentimes these autocrats come into power and they're seen as like great they're seen as like protectors of a certain group, they're it's oftentimes an underpinning of like nationalist blood in soil tendencies that push autocrats and dictators and like people like that into power in the first place.
So like like so like the like kim dynasty comes into power during the korean war after the united states drops like like thousands of tons of napalm on their cities and they're burning to the ground and then obviously like the kim dynasty oppresses the people of north korea but the fact that they that the fact that like whether in this case not military damage but economic damage, the fact that economic damage is coming at the hand of a western country, makes it more likely that you're only going to see support for regimes in the first place and their power being further in locked.
So for all those reasons we should end sanctions."
"We should ban school uniforms.
Firstly we want to distinguish between school uniforms and dress code.
So we think that dress codes that explain the parameters that people have to maintain in in order to be within school are perfectly fine ensuring that people can't do things like wear very low cut dresses or wear very short shorts, things that may be prohibitive for people be being able to pay attention in class.
Those things are not within the realm of this debate.
But this about specifically how having a school institute one way that individuals must dress and forcing them to purchase that type of uniform.
Okay so, two reasons why you we think school uniforms are bad.
Firstly, the importance of creativity and secondly, they're classist.
So firstly on creativity: we think that very early on children should learn to be empowered through expressing themselves.
We think that too often in society children are forced to maintain very specific social standards that reduce their ability to be creative.
Creativity is crucial for children learning to understand how to have comprehensive problem solving techniques.
Creativity allows for people to express themselves broadly, to become diverse individuals that learn reach out and explore the things that they're interested in.
Repression through school uniforms runs contradictory to that.
And we think, especially within a school environment, children should be learning to want to explore broadly.
And one way to do that is through their dress.
Secondly, we think that the ability to present yourself in a particular way is crucial for self expression.
We think that the way one dresses an expression is an expression of who one is.
If you present yourself wearing a suit, you're trying to send a very different message then if you're presenting yourself wearing t-shirt and jeans or wearing a bathing suit or anything like that.
And while these things may be aesthetic and solely aesthetic these things are important and send social cues to individuals.
School is a social environment just like anywhere else and individuals within that social environment should be able to express and send the messages that they want to send amongst their peers.
When people are restrained to a specific school uniforms, we think that within this crucial time in an individual's life they're repressed both in what they're able to say to individuals and they're repressed in what they learn they're repressed in the way that they're learning to explore themselves and explore the things that they might be interested in such as their fashion, such as their presentation.
We also think that the way you dress just allows you to be comfortable.
Children shouldn't be focusing on what they're wearing when they're in their classroom.
They shouldn't be constantly caught up in feeling like they're not comfortable within what they're wearing.
And we think that school uniforms often force children into this position.
Maybe you want to maybe you want to present yourself in a certain way because it gives you motivation, it gives you some sort of fulfillment and it gives you an idea of comfort within your own skin.
And we don't think that this should be denied to children especially, people like teenagers that are in incredibly vulnerable social environments.
So secondly, we think that school uniforms are broadly classist.
Children don't just not wear clothing outside of their school.
It's not like they wear the school uniform they have on the weekends when they get home or all day in their extracurriculars.
So what school uniforms are do broadly is it forces parents to buy an additional two or three sets of clothing that they need to run through every week, that they need to clean every week and take care of every week.
We think that this means that poor communities and poor individuals are excluded from these schools and are excluded from these communities.
It means that these children are forced, if you're a poor student in these schools, are forced to wear clothing that is obviously worn down, clothing that may have been passed down, things that point you out as an individual that is outside of the norm and we don't think that's acceptable.
Or the alternative is that people are forced to dress a different way, that they're not able to afford those uniforms and again they're singled out.
Specifically because of their class.
We don't think this is necessary.
Given that the way someone dresses is such an easy way to make someone feel fulfilled, is such an easy way to allow them to express themselves and given that school uniform simply put undue costs on the parents, we think that we should ban school uniforms."
"I'm proud to stand a proposition of the motion that we should abolish nuclear weapons.
Three model of this is, you know basically just we would support a world wherein countries voluntarily surrender their nuclear arsenals, were also comfortable with doing this by UN mandate but I think for the purpose of the debate this is more about the end so I'm willing to just call you out that people will surrender these arms.
So, three independent points under this: first is money, second is accidental launches, and third, sorry four independent points.
Third is environmental harms and fourth is belligerence that is enabled by possession of nuclear weapons.
So first on money, it's worth recognizing that the investments of any given country are a zero sum decision and that money poured into nuclear weapons programs are money that could be spent elsewhere, such on like social safety nets or things like that.
Nuclear weapons programs are very expensive, they cost lots of money to create in the first place, and then even more money to maintain over years and years and years.
The US alone has poured literally trillions of dollars into their nuclear program.
This is trillions of dollars that could have gone to welfare spending, it could have gone to construction of affordable housing, it could have gone to any number of things.
Even just lower taxes.
Any number of things could have actually benefited people on the ground in ways that nuclear weapons have not.
Second is accidental launches.
We think this happens in two ways: first is literally just accidents where people press a button or something like that or mis-read a signal on a computer screen.
This there literally dozens of examples of this almost happening in the cold war where someone sitting in front of a computer computer screen thought that they saw that the US had launched missiles at them or that russia had launched missiles at the US, and almost press the button to launch back only to find out that it was a computer glitch and nothing it actually happened.
So this is an example of a situation in which accidental launch can happen.
Secondly though, it's just like brinksmanship.
So something like the cuban missile crisis, where people are on the verge of using missiles as a threat and both sides almost actually press the button and do this because there is this brinksmanship happening.
This is obviously a pretty high harm, lots of people die in a situation where a nuclear weapon is launched, there's massive amounts of suffering.
Radiation creates long term suffering for generations to come.
This is something worth avoiding.
Third independent argument is environmental harms created by nuclear weapons programs.
So things like radiation, pollution, literally just the workers in the facilities and the cancer that they contract from these things.
These are massive tolls of suffering that exist in the world, where it is unclear what the benefits of having nuclear weapons are.
Things like the environment, it's so hard to actually fix in the long term, because soil is a radiator for huge amounts of time and even the human suffering, just the toll on the people working in these plants is a thing that has to be weighed in this round against benefits that are, again, intangible and unlikely to materialize ever.
The fourth independent point is regarding security.
So I think this is pretty important because it's worth recognizing that the ostensible benefit of having a nuclear weapons program is that it dis-incentivizes uses of force.
That it makes it easier for people to just basically strong arm other groups into backing down and not engaging in acts of force, because you're able to leverage the threat of nuclear weapons.
So, I think one problem with this argument certainly is the arguments already demonstrated about why brinksmanship often can risk the actual use of nuclear weapons, so that's a harm in and of itself.
But secondly, and I think a lot more importantly, is that the use of nuclear weapons to disincentivize force is not inherently a good thing.
The US for example, is notorious in using its military might, that is largely a product of its nuclear arsenal, to get smaller countries, that have often done very little wrong, to back down without a fight, right?
So like for example this was done several times in the middle east.
It was done in iran in the seventies, it was done in iraq in two thousand four with minimal resistance at a point that it took like only a couple, like a year or two for this entire country to just crumble and like saddam hussein to be found in like a hole in the ground.
Right?
I think it's important to recognize that hegemons using these as a battering ram to get people to back down, it's necessarily unfair and it entrenches systems of imperialism that might be easier to break down in a world where there wasn't such massive asymmetry in power between great powers and the developing world.
Proud to propose."
"We should privatize national parks.
On our side, we're going to argue that national parks should be auctioned off to private operators.
We're fine with setting certain restrictions on how they can use those parks, such as requiring them to operate as non-profits or to operate for the benefit of the public but, at the end of the day, we think that private groups could probably run them better than government.
Our first argument, unsurprisingly, is that governments are inefficient at operating these parks.
Because government bureaucracies are so large and so abstracted away from the people that they're helping, we think that, oftentimes, they don't know that much about a local area or have that much incentive to take care of any one park.
This means that if we were to send them off to local administration that it's much more likely that people who really care about that park and who really care about the community around it and the nature within it would run them and, therefore, that every park would get the attention that it needs, something that's oftentimes sorely lacking right now, as national park services tend to focus only on the parks that draw lots and lots of tourists from all around the world.
Our second argument is that this would increase investment in individual parks.
We think that these groups that would come to run parks privately would have much more of an incentive to advertise than the park service does.
If you advertise, then it's most likely that more people will go to parks in general.
Right now, governments don't tend to push parks very hard, except for a few parks that are very popular, such as yellowstone in the united states, and therefore, as a result, many people don't even know about the parks that they have access to or the resources that are available to them.
We think that these groups that would be advertising would then attract much more attention to the parks and, as a result, that more people would be willing to invest money, whether that be because they fall in love with the beautiful nature and want to invest in keeping it pristine and clean, or whether because local businesses see an opportunity to boost their standing in the community by becoming a sponsor of the park.
The impact of all this is that we think that much more funding overall would be available for parks if they were managed privately rather than by the state.
Government funds are always going to be limited because people are just unwilling to pay higher taxes, and because governments have bigger concerns than national parks, like welfare and the military.
But these purpose-driven groups that only care about one thing, namely, promoting the interest of this one particular park or a small number of parks in one area, would likely do a much better job attracting investment and then using that money to actually benefit this particular park.
We think that this would be good because you get a sort of virtuous cycle, where the park is improved and then more people visit, so then there's more money available and then it's improved even more, and that this could be really good for things like wildlife conservation and preservation, for educational opportunities for people to learn more about nature or to go into conservation programs, etcetera.
So, ultimately, this could be something that's beneficial for these parks in many ways.
But, finally, our third argument is that this would be really good for local economies as well.
We already mentioned how this can draw an investment.
And if you're investing a lot in a park, it's likely that you're creating jobs not only within the park, but also to serve the greater interest.
If you double the number of people who visit a relatively sparsely visited park, now another hotel or lodge has to open.
Now there have to be restaurants for those people to eat at.
Now there's gotta be a gas station that's open twenty four hours so that people who are arriving early can get gas.
So you're creating a lot of jobs in a secondary market as well as the jobs that you create directly.
And think about where these parks tend to be.
Oftentimes, they're in very rural areas that don't have a lot of economic opportunity.
So I think this could benefit a lot of people who are really struggling in the status quo.
For all these reasons, we should privatize national parks.
Thank you."
"Prenatal diagnosis should be mandatory.
So prenatal diagnoses are basically when doctors go in and examine the fetus while it's still in the mother's womb at various stages of development.
In this way they can detect physiological problems with the fetus, such as for instance, if the baby is going to be born with a certain disorder, or if the fetus is going to be unable to brought to term and is ultimately going to result in a miscarriage, and I'm sure lots of other information that I don't know about, but that would be evident to doctors.
So with that in mind we think that states should require that women undergo prenatal diagnosis.
And we're going to say that these are harmless procedures that ultimately could be done at the same time as other routine health exams.
So our first argument is that this leads to the maximum amount of information for doctors.
If you are an OBGYN and you are making decisions about a patient's health, you need to actually have access to all of the information about that patients health.
For instance if you don't know if someone is at risk of having a miscarriage, it's difficult to plan a course of treatment for that individual.
We tell you that these prenatal diagnoses make it easier to know if someone is at risk of something like a miscarriage or is at risk of having a child who is not going to live after birth.
With this in mind doctors can better advise their patients.
We think that doctors have a moral obligation to provide the best information possible to their patients.
This is true one, because they take an oath to do no harm and implicitly to do the maximum good for their patients, and two, because patients have little access to information and are dependent on doctors to give them good advice.
We think therefore that the state would be justified in stepping in, in order to ensure that doctors are actually facilitated in offering this advice.
Some people might not want these prenatal exams.
We think that it should be mandatory anyway because doctors can't give them many forms of useful advice about their child and this information or the lack thereof would actually be harmful to the child if not provided.
So we think it would be justified for the state to intervene in order to give doctors maximum information.
Our second argument is that this allows us to assess the quality of life for the fetus.
So for instance you may have a fetus that if brought to term would be born and possibly live a short period of time in tremendous agony, and at that point it's probably better to abort it before it reaches a later stage of development in order to maximize the quality of life.
Or I suppose in this instance to minimize the poor quality of life.
This is unfortunate but sometimes this is the case.
We think that it's always better to have that information so we can make the most humane decision for the fetus, rather than to just let nature take its course.
We don't live in the stone age anymore so there's no reason to treat people like we do.
Not getting access to this information is ultimately condemning some individuals to live very short, very painful lives when that could be avoided overall.
Our third argument is that this should be required because it's a low cost, high reward medical procedure.
If you are a state government for instance, there's very little cost to requiring that a citizen go and get this kind of prenatal diagnosis.
It probably only costs a few dollars in terms of an ultrasound.
We tell you at that point that you're spending very little money on what amounts to a sort of preventative care to avoid problems down the line.
And that doing this can save huge costs later on.
For instance, if someone is going to need an expensive surgery, if nothing is done, but there is an ability to prevent it because we have access to this information, then you've just saved a huge amount of money for the public.
Health care funds are normally not completely elastic.
What that means is that if one patient consumes resources, there are fewer resources for other people.
With that in mind, we think that government should always seek to use preventive care or to assess problems before they become serious so that they can spend more money on people who need immediate urgent care.
With this in mind we think that prenatal diagnosis should be mandatory.
Thank you."
"Truth and reconciliation commissions bring more good than harm.
So truth and reconciliation commissions or TRCs if you prefer, are effectively panels that are set up in post conflict societies, so think south africa in the early nineties after the end of apartheid where they were used for the effectively, which are set up so that people can come forward and admit to crimes that they committed during a period of civil war or under an oppressive regime and then if you come forward and reveal what you did under the old regime to the TRC you will not be punished in a criminal court later on.
So effectively you confess what you did.
You might be ordered to make an apology but you will not be criminally prosecuted as a result of coming forward to these TRCs.
So two arguments for why we think that the good that they do outweighs the harm that they do.
The first is about catharsis.
Recognize that after a civil conflict in particular you're going to have lots of people who are missing, who don't know where their loved ones are, who don't know what happened to people living in their town or village, and that these people have no way to find out the truth, no way to learn what happened, no way to bury their dead even without knowing from the old regime or from the other side of the civil war exactly what happened.
People can uniquely get access to this information because of truth and reconciliation commissions.
Recognize that everyone has an incentive to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth to these TRCs because it's the only way that they can avoid prosecution later on.
This means that many people will come forward and confess to crimes that they committed and it's much more likely that people will learn where their loved ones were buried or what happened to their son things like that.
We think that this catharsis is the most that people can ask for after a conflict.
You can't undo the harms of war.
You can't bring back the dead.
You can't rebuild the things that were destroyed.
All you can do is help people to heal as they move forward and we think that the catharsis that these TRCs facilitate it's going to be a really powerful tool for people to move forward.
Our second argument is about buy-in.
So basically what we mean by this is that in order for the new state to succeed after the civil war or after the insurrection, whatever it maybe, you need people from both sides of the conflict to think that the new state is legitimate.
So if you think about columbia, people from the farc side of the civil war and people from the government side of the civil war now both have to come together and agree that the government is legitimate.
So how do you do that?
First of all, you need to avoid the perception of victor's justice.
You need to make it clear that you're treating people from both sides fairly so that everyone knows that the government isn't going to continue persecuting people from the losing side of the conflict because if that's true, there's no reason for anyone to ever lay down their arms and surrender at the end of the conflict.
They'll just fight on to the death as you see with some members of farc.
So TRCs bring more good than harm because they better facilitate peace, because people have more faith in the idea that they will get justice as a result.
But on top of that they increase buy-in because people will have more faith in civil institutions.
If you're a country coming out of civil war than people are used to solving their problems through violence rather than through the state.
They're used too summary executions and things like that and you need to end those practices in order to have a successful state after the civil conflict.
So what we do on our side is create the idea that people can solve their problems through civil institutions.
These TRCs are a low stakes way to get people invested in institutions of state, which means that in the future they are more likely to rely upon those institutions.
In the long run what separates successful countries from unsuccessful ones is the ability for the government to resolve people's problems without recourse to violence and ultimately be get that better on our side and that good is going to do more in the long term that any harm of not having persecutions would right now.
So for these two reasons TRCs bring more good than harm.
Thank you."
"We should ban smoking.
So I think it's clear in this debate that we're talking about tobacco products writ large cigarettes, cigars, whatever you want to talk about, as well as other forms of smoke drugs like marijuana.
So with that said, we have two main arguments for why we think we should ban smoking.
Before I get into those though I want you to recognize that this isn't a debate about whether smoking is harmful for people's health, obviously that's true.
It's a debate about how the state ought act.
The government of a country is the actor in this debate and that's the perspective that you need to have as you consider what we should do.
Our first argument then is about when the government should paternalize.
When the government should intervene and limit citizens freedom because it knows their own best interest better than they know it themselves.
We're gonna set out a two part standard.
The first is when there is a an asymmetry of information between two actors.
We see that, for instance, governments don't let children enter into contracts.
Now this is of course a limitation on children's personal freedom and it might be the case that some children are intelligent and precocious enough that they would want to enter into contracts but because by and large children lack decision making ability and access to information the government intervenes to protect them on the assumption that adults would always have more information and be able to take advantage of them.
In the same way government also limits adults from making certain choices.
You can't contract yourself into slavery, for instance, because you aren't able to fully internalized the harms that that will happen over the long term so the state intervenes.
Now given that when we talk about the tobacco industry you have huge very powerful corporations with massive marketing budgets and the ability to manipulate scientific information available to the public.
We think that it's clear that adults in a given country do not have enough access to information to make an informed decision about smoking and therefore that the government ought to intervene on their behalf to prevent them from making harmful decisions.
We think that by and large we're okay with people making bad decisions when they have access to information, but not when they're being misled intentionally.
The second part of our standard is when there are third party harms and this is clearly true of smoking.
It's a well known fact that second hand smoke puts people at risk of lung cancer.
This is why in a lot of places around the world like many cities in europe and the united states, you now can't smoke in bars and restaurants.
We think that because even though smoking is a personal choice it affects everyone around you that it ought not be permitted.
The other team might tell you that it would be acceptable to just ban smoking in public and that that would get the same solvency but that still doesn't do things like protect children whose parents smoke or the partners that people who smoke.
We think that at the end of the day, the only reasonable course of action to protect these third parties who are harmed by individual choice to smoke is to ban smoking in itself.
Our second argument, which is completely independent from the first, is about why there's a compelling state interest in banning smoking.
What do we mean by this?
Governments in almost every country in the world provide for citizens health care that might be through something like medicare and medicaid in the states or national health in britain.
We see therefore that governments are ultimately going to pay more money into their health care systems to care for people who have smoked throughout their lives because these people are at such a high risk for diseases like emphysema that are so expensive to treat, what this means is that the state has a financial interest in limiting the number of people who smoke in order to keep down health costs in the future.
This is important for a couple of reasons and should decide how you feel about this debate.
One, money is fungible.
Any money that the state puts towards helping people with emphysema and lung cancer isn't money that's being put towards primary education, or researching a cure for diabetes and other good things that the state could be doing but two, people are making a conscious decision right now that makes them a burden on the state in the future.
We think that we should limit their ability to do so because effectively people are able to free ride in many countries when they have nationalized health and they don't bear the cost of their choice to smoke.
We should prevent them from making that choice because it is antisocial and harms other people.
So because of the standard we set up for when the state can intervene and because of the compelling state interest we should ban smoking.
Thank you."
"We should abolish the presidential pardon.
Three main arguments, first on why it is undemocratic.
When the president provides a pardon, he basically flies in the face of all of the laws and democratic will of the people for whom he's supposed to serve.
Because when a person is found guilty and punished for a crime, they receive the punishment the society has communally decided on and essentially consented into.
This is the one thing that is oftentimes, and it needs to be, incredibly consistent within society.
The idea that similar punishments need to be punished in similar ways because just because you have the status of knowing the president or the status of being some type of person does not exempt you from the punishment that you ought be having, the one that everybody in society opts into.
This is why we see massive movements against asymmetric judges and against people who receive different punishments for the same crime, because the one thing that society all consents to is when you have done wrong you ought be punished and here's the punishment it will be.
So when the president pardons, he places the person he pardons above other members of society and deems them above the law.
This is problematic because democracy should be run by the will of the people, not the will of the one person who has enough power to do whatever they want.
This disbalances the government branches because it essentially provides the president with a way to fly in the face of both the legislature and the judicial branch by basically saying even though I know you wrote this law and even though I know you enforce this law, I get to just be the person who flies in the face of all of that.
We think this is really problematic both because it gives an asymmetric number amount of power to the president but also because it now means that we cannot rely on consistency within our legal system.
We can't rely on pushing for a more fair system because there will always be this one factor led by this one person who can just do whatever they want.
Our second argument is about why this is really nepotistic.
Recognize that in order to obtain a presidential pardon, you oftentimes have to know the president in some way.
Like, the the largest and loudest pardons have all been for people who have been relatively wealthy.
All have been for people who tended to have some personal connection to the white house and even though sometimes you do get some like low level pardons for people who just like didn't deserve to be in jail, this is something that happens a lot less often than just some rich person who knows the president personally or like is politically beneficial for them getting a pardon.
And we think this is really problematic because it essentially just says if you have enough of like an upper class leverage, then you just don't have to deal with the same kind of complications or problems that the general population has to deal with.
We just don't think that you should be giving such a tool when it's going to be used in a inconsistent imbalanced manner and so we just think insofar as it is nepotistic, it ought not exist.
Our third argument is about preventing long term efficacy.
Our world runs on a twenty four hour news cycle so when pardons happen, they end up erasing the important topics that often underlie the reason for them.
When people feel like the government is unjust or a law is unjust, they can rile up against the law, but in order to accumulate that political capital and that political will, they often need to be able to rile around some kind of stimulus or some kind of action.
So when the president steps in first, the displeasure about the law can be dissipated before people are able to come together and start political movements because he just pardons the person who was the focus of that movement or the start-up for that movement.
We think that it is better to remove an unjust law than to continually pardon the people who get messed up by it.
And to do that, the groups need to be able to amass the political will which happens when hot button topics stick around in the news cycle rather than being resolved immediately by a president who pardoned them.
Insofar as we want long term efficacious change so that we can protect the people who are going to be accused of this in the future rather than just pardoning the person who's accused of it now, we think we should abolish the presidential pardon.

"The notion that universal healthcare is a good in and of itself is almost intuitive.
It's worth recognizing that in a world where people have egalitarian access, in a world wherein people with preexisting conditions aren't actively discriminated against, people are better off, people are treated more fairly, people have a higher quality of life.
It's for this reason that I stand in proposition in today's motion.
Two independent points: first, that insurance leads to a higher quality of life for the individual people who are the recipients of it, and secondly, that universal coverage is more fair, thus justifying governmental intervention for a larger societal impact that is beneficial to all.
First, on the notion of on insurance creating individual increases in quality of life.
There are three reasons why this is true.
First, insurance creates expenditures.
You can budget around hundred dollar a month payments, for example, through your insurance.
This is especially true if your employer is actually making those payments for you.
Even if there are decreases on your employer's ability to have some level of optimal economic efficiency as a result of this, it's always true that a recurring smaller fee is easier to budget around.
But something like a hundred thousand dollars all at once that people might get slammed with because of some horrible injury that occurs later in their life, that's really tough to budget around.
That's not something that you see coming and as a result, people are less equipped to deal with it.
So when we smooth out the expenditures, when it's small payments over a long duration as opposed to a big payment all at once, that always makes things easier for the person that is on the worse end of that transaction.
Secondly, it increases the individual's ability to be treated.
People without coverage often forego things like medications, because they simply can't afford it without the coverage.
We give the option then, with government-provided insurance or employers or mandated employer provided insurance, to actually get treatment for ailments, things that create massive amounts of suffering amongst people around the country, and as a result, we create a better life for the individual.
And thirdly is peace of mind.
There is a legitimate psychological toll to knowing that your next financially crushing experience, in addition to the physical pain that it might ensue, is right around the corner.
With insurance, you give people everyday people the ability to say: I know that if something is coming around the corner, something unexpected, it's not going to jeopardize my kid's ability to go to college.
It's not going to jeopardize my ability to keep my home or my car or something else that's systemically important to my livelihood.
And as a result of that, we think this is something that benefits the individual.
My second independent point is that universal coverage is more fair on a societal level.
Again, three reasons why this is true.
First is racial inequality.
Insurers often won't cover people of non-white people who have traits that are often coded language, for example, living in a dangerous neighborhood or comes from a family that didn't historically have insurance.
It's easy for insurers to get around these types of things because coded language is so hard to crack down on.
You but when you just enforce universal coverage, you can't get around that.
You can't like weasel your way out of just having to insure everybody in the country and as a result of that, we ensure an egalitarian system.
Secondly, you don't create an insurance system that necessarily discriminates against women.
This is both in terms of access to coverage, but also in terms of the fact that like being female has just historically been considered a preexisting condition.
That increases costs for women and again, creates a level of an egalitarianism that is unforgivable.
And thirdly, we decrease discrimination against people with preexisting conditions, like say, physical disabilities.
We say that these are people too, that these are people who deserve access to fair coverage and deserve access to the health care that is necessary for them to actually live a happy and meaningful life.
And as a result of that, we create a system that is more equal, that is fairer for them.
I think it's important to note that regardless of what the mechanism is, it is always good to create a system that insures as many people as possible, that creates a system that allows people to have a better quality of life.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should end the use of economic sanctions.
We think this is a normative debate ie we prefer a world in which governments did not use economic sanctions against each other.
Three main areas of clash, first on why they're ineffective.
Recognize that the goal of economic sanctions is to force a country to cease a bad behavior and it's used most against dictatorial and other non-democratic regimes that are being oppressive because there's really no incentive to like harm yourself economically unless this is like an extreme case.
The problem with these kind of with like the way that we use them is that these kind of regimes are the most likely to have built and maintained their power in part by using antiwestern sentiment and by talking about how they're going to keep themselves like kowtowing to the west etcetera and because of the rhetoric that they often use they can't be seen as capitulating to western demands because it hurts their image and hurts their support so like ie a lot of like big dictators are upheld by a few large families that are really really rich but those large families are also often built on patriotism and keep their money by maintaining an isolationist perspective that says that the west is awful so if the dictator was to say no I mean to capitulate to these economic sanctions they risk losing a whole lot more money and a whole lot of political support from their biggest donors.
The other reason that it doesn't work is often because the regime holders are usually selfish individuals and won't bite the harms of losing money either way so they don't care about their populace.
Like at the end of the day, these dictators aren't the ones taking the pay cut.
They're going to maintain the same amount of comfort and the same amount of money in both worlds and as such they have no incentive to care about the fact that people are going to suffer more when we have economic sanctions against them.
The other issue is that like now once you have sanctions you can't you can't remove them until the person capitulates because that looks bad on you and like as a western country you don't want to be the one who takes down sanctions until they work because you don't want to seem weak.
Unfortunately capitulation vever happens so you don't get any kind of long term solvency and we think this hurts long term democratization as well because recognize the best way to democratize a nation is by building a middle class and building some kind of like free flow of speech but that only happens if you are able to exert your influence somehow which oftentimes comes best through money.
We think the best way in which you built like have any chance of building middle classes or having like activism groups is when you have a like a some kind of trade going on when like maybe you've cajoled them into letting amnesty international in so they can provide some kind of service to your people but like sanctions completely cut off that avenue and so can never be effective even in the short term but especially are like stunting our goals into the long term.
Our second area of clash is about how it hurts the worst off.
Recognize like as I told you dictators aren't the ones taking the big cut just because there's less net money now now even less goes to people through existing welfare programs any kind of government subsidies that existed like now if the dictators worried about acquiring food they just take more of it by force like it's not the case the dictators that are harmed it's only the case that you're starving the people you're trying to save from the regime in the first place.
But our third area of clash is about it hurts how it hurts countries who issue sanctions in the first place.
Recognize that international trade is an economic tool that is really beneficial to individual nations and individual groups because if I'm able to like buy something more cheaply here that's good for me and if I'm able to sell to a given nation that's also good for me so the problem happens that when you issue economic sanctions whatever that nation used to provide you with or vice versa becomes either more expensive for you to acquire because you have to go to someone who knows you have no other options and so knows they can raise the price or your own goods become cheaper because other countries can exploit you in a similar manner.
They can say like look now you have no one to sell it to you so you're going to sell it to us for less and we think that insofar as this like hurts you as well we don't think you ought to be doing it.
Proud to propose."
"Open source software is advantageous.
So, right now in the status quo, you have two types of software: closed source, where one company owns the code, imagine microsoft windows as an example of this, and open source, where the code is freely available to anyone who wants to use and modify it.
Think about linux as an example of software that works like that.
And by advantageous, we mean that although there are obviously some pros and cons to each side, we think that widespread adoption of open-source software would basically be a good thing.
Three arguments.
The first is that open-source software is more accessible to more people.
What does this mean?
With closed-source software, companies are able to charge much higher prices for their product than they could for something that was open-source.
Now if you think about something like microsoft word, it costs about a hundred dollars, and many people around the world simply can't afford that product.
If you think about computer users in a country like brazil or south africa, where incomes are much lower than they are in britain or the united states, people there will probably never be able to access these products, whereas a product like openoffice, which is an open-source alternative, are much more accessible to these people.
You see that open-source products sometimes cost money, but generally a much lower rate, because anyone can get the code and make their own version, and other times are free, which is great because it means that people who are the most needy in the world, low-income people, people in the developing world, can access the software.
Which means that people can develop new skills which will let them succeed in the globalizing economy.
We think that, you know, if schoolchildren in countries like brazil or like india are not able to learn about how to use computer software because it's too expensive, that that will prevent them from succeeding as computer skills become more and more important to the global economy.
So we think that this access is really great for the developing world.
Our second argument is that this limits the power of developers.
Recognize that if you have closed-source software, there's only one group of people, the developer, who can help you to use that software.
So if you think about say, the US military using software that's developed by I don't know, lockheed martin, if there is a problem with that software, the only people that they can go to are lockheed martin which means that, first of all, lockheed is able to charge basically as much as they want, because once the US government has adopted the software, it would be very expensive to change to something else.
So lockheed has a lot of control over them and can gouge prices.
But on top of that, you have very sensitive data and now, if there's ever a problem accessing that data, you need lockheed people to be able to go in and retrieve that data for you, which we think compromises the ability to protect that.
We think that, for instance, if another country were to hire a foreign firm and to use their services, that this would compromise their security, whereas with open-source software, someone internally in your government or your corporation can decide what software to use, can build it up from the code themselves, and no one from outside can compromise your data or hold you hostage with high prices.
So we think that this is good for both governments and private firms.
A last argument is that open-source software is more adaptable.
Because anyone can contribute, you have a much deeper talent pool working on a given project.
We tell you that you can also reuse and recycle parts of old software in order to create new software rather than starting over again at ground zero.
When you think about closed-source software, if microsoft has a product and google wants to make a similar product, they can't just start at what microsoft had and then build up to make it better.
They have to begin again at ground zero.
Ultimately, we think it will be better if more companies could reuse and recycle each other's software, that this would propel faster development and more flexible software that could address more diverse problems.
So because it promotes access, because it limits the power of the developers, and because it's adaptable, open-source software is advantageous.
Thank you."
"Suicide should be a criminal offense.
So I want to be very clear that in this debate, we aren't saying that there should be any particular action taken by a state when someone has attempted suicide.
And on top of that, I'd like to point out that obviously people who are unfortunately successful in suicide attempts can't be punished, we're not going to prevent them from being interred in public cemeteries and things like that.
We think that it should be people who attempt suicide or indicate attempt at suicide who should be taken into the legal system, and this is for two reasons.
One, we think that this could actually help victims of suicidal ideation.
So recognize that right now, states have relatively little incentive to take action to make suicide more difficult.
Recognize that when people are contemplating suicide, this is usually an ideation that only last for a few moments, it's not something that's planned out over the long term, and most people who attempt suicide and fail later say that they regret it and are glad that they've lived, and were able, you know, to go on with their lives.
So we think that governments have an obligation that they are failing to meet right now, to make suicide more difficult.
Doing things like installing barriers on bridges, limiting access to firearms for people with mental illness, limiting access to prescription drugs that could be abused in this way, and that ultimately the only way to make governments care is to involve the legal system.
We see that in the status quo, treating suicide as purely a health problem isn't working to get governments to take real action in order to help people who are in this position.
And recognize, these people are about as vulnerable as anyone in our society can get, at the point where their very lives are at risk because of an immutable characteristic.
Nobody chooses to have mental illness and we need to keep that in mind as we go forward.
But so we think that by making suicide a criminal offense, the government will have an obligation to step up to protect it or prevent it, in the same way that they have an obligation to prevent other forms of crime.
We see that governments take action to prevent things like theft and murder, we think that if suicide were treated in the same category, the governments would similarly have to intervene.
So when you think about this debate, you need to think how could we make governments behave in a way that will ultimately reduce the number of suicides.
And I think it's clear that on our side of the house, we're going to win this debate.
And we think that when people are ultimately charged with this attempt, we don't have to go and put them in prison, it's not gonna be like orange is the new black.
We can instead put these people in mental hospitals, we can commit them against their will if we need to, which is something that's very difficult to do in many liberal countries, but that might be the best thing for these people.
We can have them assessed by medical professionals and make sure that they get the treatment that they need free of charge, things like that.
So recognize that the quote unquote punishment that we assign doesn't have to be prison, it can be help that these people really need in this vulnerable position.
So with that in mind I think that we're clearly better on our side for the victims of mental illness.
And our second argument, just briefly, is about how this changes business incentives.
Right now, groups like insurance companies, life insurance companies, are kind of in an awkward position when it relates to suicide.
Life insurance, as far as I know, in basically every country doesn't pay out for suicide.
But we think that at the point where this is a death that is caused by illness, it probably ought be covered in some way.
So what happens when suicide becomes criminalized?
First of all, now there's a very clear legal stance for suicide, it's not something that's grey.
So we think that you'll more likely to see legislation that surrounds this, surrounds the ability ability of these policies to be paid out, things like that.
And even if insurance companies continue not to pay out, we think that it's easier for families to get recourse as effectively the victims of a crime, and then actually have some way to support themselves, if, you know, a primary provider is the person who takes this unfortunate action.
So at the end of the day, we think we're also better for the families by clarifying the legal status of suicide.
For these reasons, I think that it's clear that they should be a criminal offense.
Thank you."
"We should tax plastic bags.
So, by plastic bags, we're talking about the kind of bags you would receive at a store when you buy something, and we think that a tax like ten cents for every plastic bag used would be sufficient.
This type of policy has been implemented in california, in boston, and in many other parts of the US, and we think that it could be effective throughout the world if adjusted for things like cost of living and the prevalence of plastic bags in different countries.
So our first point is that we need to make people internalize the cost of their actions.
The use of plastic bags has a high cost to the environment.
These bags never break down, so they sit in landfills for thousands of years potentially.
In the future, it's going to cost billions of dollars to clean up these landfills and find a way to dispose of all the plastic in them.
But right now, you and I can go to the corner store and pick something up that's triple-wrapped in plastic bags, and it doesn't cost us anything.
So we get them, we use them, we throw them away, and we never think about it.
When you tax these bags, you make people think about the cost, because you're transferring a tiny portion of it from the general public onto that one individual.
We think this would have a few effects.
First of all, people would be less likely to use these in gratuitous ways.
I see this in my own life.
Now if I go down to the corner and I buy one item, I don't get a plastic bag for it, because of the tax.
I carry it back in my hands.
There's no reason why I or anyone else in california couldn't have done this before the tax, but it's much more likely that people will try to avoid paying a fine or a fee, even if it's very small, than they would just do the right thing.
So, ultimately, we think that people are more likely to carry things or even to get other types of bags as a result of this.
Many people have switched to using reusable bags, which are generally recyclable and also can be used dozens of times compared to the one or two uses most plastic bags get.
So we think that as a result of making people internalize these costs, they're less likely to ask for a bag in the first place, and they're more likely to get reusable bags, which can reduce the use of plastic bags astronomically, as they remove our dependence from them.
Our second argument is that this would encourage the production of other types of bag.
Right now, it's very likely that if you produce plastic bags, you're worried about these types of taxes going into effect because they reduce demand for your product.
What's going to happen is that plastic bag companies will switch over to producing bags that are able to decompose in order to avoid having to pay this tax on their product, so that their business will continue.
That might mean that they switch over to paper bags, which is something that you see many grocery stores do when plastic bag taxes go into effect.
They offer everyone a brown paper bag which will decompose in a few months rather than a plastic bag that will still be there in ten thousand years.
So we think that this would be a huge boon to the environment because if large producers switch over to paper bags instead of plastic, then even in areas that don't have this tax, it's likely that they'll switch over to using paper bags as well, since that's what the producers are making.
The other possibility is that these producers will innovate and create biodegradable plastic bags, which we think would be good for everyone.
If that's the case, then we'll see that we won't have these bags in landfills for hundreds of years and that people will still be able to get the bags that they want but the impetus, the the mother of this invention, is going to be the plastic bag tax that creates the cost that these companies set out to avoid.
So, ultimately, because we need to make people internalize the environmental costs of their plastic bag use and because we want to encourage the production of alternative types of bags, we should tax plastic bags.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should criminalize blasphemy.
For the purposes of this round we will define blasphemy as religious hate speech targeted specifically to incite discomfort or unhappiness and we would say that it's distinct from disagreement or questioning of religion in that it specifically insults and targets it.
So the difference between saying, I don't know if god exists or I don't believe that god exists and saying your god is awful, fuck your god.
Two main areas of clash on this.
First on hate speech as violence.
First recognize that there is no difference between emotional pain and physical pain.
The same neurons fire in my brain when you are hitting me as those that when you are verbally abusing me because mental and psychological discomfort chemically does not differ from physical discomfort.
We see this also when we diagnose things like depression or other psychological disorders that these kinds of pains are equally valid to any sort of physical illness that might occur.
So at that point, if we can ban assault and like physical fighting, you should also be able to ban hate speech given that it can elicit the same kind of painful result.
We also think that hate speech implicitly freezes out the people that it's directed at and makes it so that they cannot function in that space without fear.
So because I am repeatedly called names and derogatory terms based on my religion, because you are constantly making fun of this core part of my being, I no longer feel comfortable enough in that space in order to self actualize.
We think that the rights of these people to be free and to like feel comfortable in their own free speech is always going to be more important than other rights to others right to extremist speech because hate speech makes them afraid to talk and thus reduces both their right to free speech and their right to safety to the point where it doesn't exist.
So we think that it's okay to ban this kind of speech when it's going to infringe on the rights of others and their functionality is less than yours.
But are second area of clash has to do with hate speech inciting violence.
Recognize that if you insult my activities I might be unhappy for a little bit but it's not going to change the way that I view the world because in the end I like my thing, you like yours, that's fine.
But insulting a belief system is always more likely to cause violence because it's fundamental to my existence.
It explains why I'm here and you telling me that it's wrong invalidates my existence on this earth.
We think that when the government signals that it's not okay to participate in this kind of speech, it trickles down to the communities underneath that government.
So this acts in two ways.
First, obviously, with regulating extremist groups.
If you say that you can put a nazi in jail for insulting jews, the jewish religion, then nazis are much less likely to publicly do so and cause harm.
But also when you have struggles between different factions and different sects of religion, so currently, hindu the hindus of india and the muslims of pakistan have massive rifts and often threatened violence on each other based on the religion.
But these kind of groups also tend to calm down when they see that there are governmental implications to what they are doing.
So preventing violence from starting we think is enough of a reason to ban this kind of speech in the first place because when multiple people are being harmed in violence not only are their rights being invalidated but it also creates a world in which that violence becomes acceptable and normalized and you lead to more violence in the long term.
We also think that a strong governments' signal on the part of one government can influence others and also its own.
We see this acting in two ways.
First, if you have a law in place that says don't blaspheme you're much less likely to end up with politicians such as donald trump gaining traction who are willing to insult muslims because if that's against the law you don't see it as something that is acceptable.
But it also sends messages to other people.
So if the US says no more blaspheming, that's bad.
It's much more likely that countries that want to maintain relations with them are going to stop being as oppressive to other religious groups as they previously were.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"We should subsidize journalism.
So by this we mean that the state should provide perhaps salaries for certain journalists or subsidize the cost of attending journalism school and otherwise facilitate journalism within a country.
Three arguments: the first is that we need to limit elite control over journalism.
If you look at the world right now, people like rupert murdoch have tremendous control over the media.
He owns different news organizations such as news channels and newspapers in countries like britain, the states, and australia, and has tremendous control over the access to information globally and this is just one very wealthy man.
We think that the only way ordinary people can counterbalance the sort of pro-elite narratives that someone like that is going to push, is if the state intervenes.
We tell you that one reason why we have a state is so that the weak are able to band together in order to resist the strong and that this is one instance where that's necessary.
There is no news company that's owned by low income people for instance, because why would there be?
They have no income in order to support a news organization but the state can intervene and ensure that viewpoints that are important to those people are actually being represented and that elites don't push a false pro elite narrative, which we think does go on in the status quo.
When you see that many news organizations support candidates who are pro big business, pro capitalism, pro whatever majority group, and ignore the plight of minorities or ignore the truth in the matter when they report.
Our second argument is about producing higher quality news media.
When the only incentive for news companies is profit, you get the lowest common denominator.
Why is this the case?
When you produce something that's very very high quality and very perhaps even difficult to access because it relies on a lot of outside information, you have a smaller consumer base.
This means that a news organization that's focused on really in depth coverage of important issues won't be able to make money as one that offers surface level coverage of issues that appeal to a lot of people.
This is probably why there is more coverage of kim kardashian than there is of theresa may in the american media.
Obviously theresa may matters more to all of our lives because she is the prime minister of an important ally but kim kardashian appeals to more people because they want to know what's up with her and kanye, so the news media focuses on them and not what really matters.
We think that the government can subsidize coverage of things like culture that goes beyond popular culture, can subsidize the coverage of issues of national importance, to be sure that ordinary people have access to that information and ultimately that this is the best way to get that information into the hands of voters.
Recognize that right now, sure, magazines like the economist in foreign affairs exists but they're expensive and not a lot of people have access to them, but with government subsidies these things could either be cheaper or there could be government run alternatives that were cheaper.
The other team might say that we're just defending russia today but we're okay with having some sort of completely independent standard like what you have with government funded defense attorneys so that these journalists aren't accountable to public officials but instead are accountable to some sort of independent review board to be sure that our money is spent wisely without you know, ending up with some sort of propaganda organ like russia today.
Our third argument is about preserving minority viewpoints.
I want to be clear, we're not saying that libertarians need a government funded news magazine, although that would be kind of amusing, or that we should be funding you know publishing pravda or whatever in the united states.
What we are saying is that the government should fund news organizations run by and for members of minority ethnic and religious groups.
Groups like hispanic and african americans are systematically excluded from the private media.
Because they are a smaller market than white americans, it's never going to be as profitable to try to appeal to them, so they get ignored by major news industry.
We think that the government can step in and correct for this by providing funding for members of minority groups to go to journalism school providing avenues for them to be able to publish their journalism and this will increase awareness of issues that face minority communities and also the ability of them to advocate for themselves rather than to rely on white journalists.
So for these three reasons we should subsidize journalism.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should make abstinence-only sex sexual education mandatory.
A little bit of modeling: we think that we're in the united states, and we would say that every ninth grade would have a mandatory class that would preach abstinence-only as their main form of sex education.
So, they would talk a little bit about the human body, and then at the end say that the way that you do not get pregnant and stay safe and prevent HIV and other diseases is by not having sex at all.
What but we are not regulating if a school wants to offer multiple classes, then the sex ed abstinence-only one will be mandatory, and children might be able to choose in addition, in a future year, to take one of the others, we think that's fine, even though probably unlikely.
Three main areas of clash: first, on why this is better than no sexual education and why no sexual education is usually the result in schools that do not take up abstinence-only.
Because recognize that most schools currently don't offer real sex ed, because there are conservative constituents, parents, faculty, that don't appreciate it.
And at the point that they try to have a more liberal sex education and they don't get away with it, they usually end up with having nothing at all, because a lot of them are very stubborn.
So what we provide is a sexual education that no one is going to oppose.
People can still learn about their bodies, it just ends in telling people that abstinence only is the only way to prevent like definitively prevent pregnancy or diseases, which is technically true, and we don't think it's actually a problem for children to be learning this.
It also keeps people from pulling their kids out of school because they don't want them to have a liberal sexual education.
We think a lot of the time in very conservative areas, you do have people who are more willing to take their children out of schools than to have them listen to why sex isn't necessarily evil.
And we think that we owe it to these people to protect the the kids' learning first.
Given that the purpose of school is to educate individuals, we think we're always going to prioritize keeping people in those schools so that they can learn all of the other subjects.
Our second area of clash is that in the end, sexual education isn't the role of the school.
Schools teach academic facts whereas sex is an intimate topic that most kids don't feel comfortable talking to adults about.
Schools shouldn't be forcing them into these in-depth discussions or difficult situations in which they're sitting in a coed classroom that is discussing intimate parts of their bodies, and we think it can actually impede someone's ability to learn if they're feeling very uncomfortable in one class to learn in others.
And so, we think that they're going to actually receive more comprehensive sexual education from the internet that is actually tailored to their needs.
This is especially true given that schools can never personalize sex ed to each person whereas abstinence-only is pretty much one-size-fits-all.
Even if I'm a non-binary lesbian, not having sex is still the only certain way that I might be able to not contract any diseases, but having a heteronormative, liberal sex ed class might actually be more dangerous to me, because I'm going to have a very like impeded view of the world in which heteronormativity dominates the way that I think.
And so, we actually prefer a world in which they can get this extra information from their parents and the internet, because it's going to be more comprehensive.
Our third area of clash is about resource allocation.
Because right now especially, we see that public educational systems are struggling with money, and they often have to choose between the programs that they have to cut.
And it's a lot easier to have a couple of classes that say "" do not have sex "", than to have multiple intensive classes that are going to talk about different ways that you have sex or how to be safe.
Like, in general, it's just a lot longer and more drawn out and difficult.
And so we prefer that they spend this money on real classes and educational materials, and they shouldn't be wasting kids' time when they could be building resumes for colleges and jobs.
Like we think that one time slot out of a day is actually a lot, and we prefer for them to be as little as possible so that kids can actually have more time to do their education-based things.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should abolish the two-party system.
So, by the two-party system, we mean something that exists in countries like the US or britain where, although other parties are legally permitted, only two parties ever control the government.
In a country like the US, with a presidential system, this might mean that only two major parties exist, period, and in a country like britain, with the westminster parliamentary system, we think that it might mean that one of two parties always forms government, although sometimes in coalition with minor parties, and the other party always forms the loyal opposition.
We think that the mechanism by which to abolish the two-party system should be to institute a preferential voting system.
What we mean by this is that whereas in britain or the US, whichever candidate wins the majority of the votes in a district goes on to become the member of parliament or the senator.
We would prefer a system in which people rank all of the candidates, and then the candidate that is ranked the most highly on aggregate goes on.
And this would allow people to rank their first, second, third choice so that they wouldn't worry about the greater and lesser evil when they vote, but rather about their actual preferences.
Three arguments for why we should abolish the two-party system.
The first is about maximizing choice.
In a country like britain, you're perfectly free to vote for parties besides the tories or labor, but one of the two is always going to win.
What that means is even if you would prefer to vote for say, a trade union socialist, you will always vote for labor because if you don't, it means that you're throwing your vote away because the tories will be slightly better off because one labor voter hasn't voted for labor.
On our side, you're perfectly free to rank that trade union socialist above the labor party candidate, but then put tory at the bottom of the list and ultimately, you will still end up with a labor member of parliament, but your actual preferences will be reflected, and it's much more likely that you'll actually see a third-party candidate get elected in some districts than what happens right now.
This would mean that representation in parliament would reflect people's opinions more closely, and presumably that lawmaking and decision-making would reflect the will of the people better than it does in the status quo.
Our second argument is that we think that this would better protect minority viewpoints.
So recognize that in many countries, people vote largely along ethnic lines.
In the US, for instance, we see that over ninety percent of african americans vote for the democratic party and large majority of hispanics as well, while predominantly white people vote for the republicans.
We think that if you had a better voting system or multiple parties, then it would be easier for groups to form a party to represent their own interests.
Right now there is no party that uniquely represents the interest of black americans in the house of representatives or the senate, because african americans have to vote for the democrats in order to be sure that the republicans don't win, the lesser evil thinking that I was talking about before.
On our side, we think it's more likely that you would have minority political parties form that would uniquely protect the interest of these groups and that would advocate them for them better than these sort of big-tent parties are able to do.
Because recognize that even if many black people are voting for the democrats, most democratic representatives are still white so they don't really understand what the community needs, whereas on our side, when you would institute this different voting system, you would be more likely to have black people elected to the house of representatives or the senate, and we think that this would hold true for other multicultural democracies as well.
Our last argument is that this would encourage coalition building.
In a country like the UK right now, even though, in theory, they have minority parties, the tories were able to form a government with no input from any other party, which means that the majority of people who didn't vote for the tories have no say in the government's policies.
A minority effectively controls the majority, which is not the purpose of democracy.
Some people in the audience may be groaning because their country has problems with coalitions forming, but we think that at the end of the day, it is always preferable to encourage people to work with those who think differently from themselves rather than to allow one ideological block to control the entire nation.
So for these three reasons, we should abolish the two-party system.
Thank you."
"Abstinence only sex education brings more good than harm.
In this debate, when we're talking about abstinence only sex education, we wanna be talking about it in the sense of a policy, as a broad prescribed thing that is taught within education.
We don't wanna talk about people's personal decisions, about what they choose to teach their children, but we're going to talk about this and the implications of this in a broad social context as a policy.
So, firstly we wanna say that abstinence as a practice is probably good.
Why do we think that this is the case?
Three reasons: the first is that while it's true that there are other methods of birth control and prevention of STD's, no other method of birth control or STD prevention is as effective as abstinence.
Abstinence will ensure that individuals don't receive premature pregnancy or receive some sort of disease that could have a serious and adverse effect on their life going forward.
We think that especially amongst young people the possibility of mis using their their contraception, or the possibility of spreading disease and not being mature enough to share that that information with their sexual partner, we think that these types of things are most likely to occur amongst young people and we think that as an educational system absence or as a policy for people prior to marriage abstinence is a preferable method.
Secondly we think that if abstinence only, or if abstinence is normalized, it creates a sphere in which there's less social pressure to have sex.
We think that in the status quo there's immense social pressure amongst young people to be sexually active, or opposing that, there is also immense sexual pressure to be to, that goes against individuals.
That shames them for their sexual behavior.
We think that if abstinence is normalized as what people ought to be doing or as what people broadly are doing, we think that individuals will face less pressure in their day to day lives to be sexually provocative and to be sexually active in ways that they may not feel comfortable doing but are simply doing to fit in.
And thirdly, we think that when one waits for marriage they are able to have a closer bond with the person that they wait with.
We think that when you have some sort of intense and intimate sexual relationship only with your married partner, we think that that becomes something that is unique and special to you and makes sex even more valuable when it happens.
Why does this why does this link to sex education?
We think that through education you can begin to normalize the idea of abstinence only sex.
Or of abstinence only behavior.
We think that if you want to encourage this type of behavior, the best way to do it is through the educational system.
It's through an educational system that says very clearly that abstinence only is the way to go and preaches the harms and explains those harms of not going along that line.
So even if you don't believe that abstinence is good we think secondly that parents should have the right to choose how their children are being educated.
We think that sex education is only a very small part of what people send their ur send their children to school for and we think that parents have a better understanding of their children.
So they have a better understanding of how sexually active their children are, they have a better understanding of what they want for their children and whether or not they want their children to be sexually engaged within society.
Because of this, and because information to these types of things, to how to use contraception is broadly available on the internet, in media, place, you can get this type of information from a doctor, you can get this information broadly from many sources.
Given that this is the case we don't think that schools are the only way to engage in sex education and to learn about things like contraception and therefore parents should be given the strength and the ability to choose for their children at what pace they're going to learn about sex.
When they're going to learn about sex?
When they're going to learn about contraception?
We think that parents, having an intimate connection their children, have a better understanding of this than schools, and as a policy we should respect that understanding and allow parents to make these decisions.
So because of this and because abstinence as a practice is generally and socially preferable to broadly having sex and encouraging sexual behavior, we believe that abstinence only sex education brings more good than harm."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish the right to silence.
The model for this in the status quo there is a right to remain silent which means that the silence of an individual in like in response to a question cannot be interpreted or seen as a marker of their guilt.
This is primarily in terms of the way the judge or the jury is going to use a silence.
In our world we think that people can still be quiet, they still don't have to answer their questions especially right after an arrest or before their lawyer gets there but now judge jury et cetera can be suspicious of that silence and if that silence is to continue can use it in their rulings.
Two main areas of clash, first on why principally we don't think the right to remain silent is a real right.
Recognize the right to remain silent is there to prevent unjust intrusions of the state and ensure fairness in court.
But the problem is that it doesn't address either of these issues in any kind of cohesive manner.
We think the state isn't intruding when it asks you a question as part of a criminal investigation.
If anything we think the state is trying to fulfill its role in protecting society and as such we think that any right that could be imagined here the state has the right to suspend for the sake of efficacy and for the sake of preventing someone who could continue to harm society from entering back into it.
If someone stands accused of a crime it isn't an intrusion to ask them questions that you might figure out what that crime is about.
In fact it sounds more like an obstruction of justice when individuals who have been accused can refuse to engage and thus just like circumvent the entire judicial process and like wait for a lawyer who talks pretty enough to get them off.
We think that at the end of the day it matters that individuals are forced to provide answers even if that answer is I am guilty because we think at the end of the day regardless of the law it is factually true that refusing to answer is a suspicious action.
If you have an alibi or you didn't commit the crime there's no reason to remain silent insofar as you can just state what your alibi was or say that you are innocent and so we think that the majority of the time the people who are going to use the right to remain silent are those who don't have an alibi who do happen to be guilty and just don't want to admit it and want to see if they can stretch out the process enough to get a plea deal or get away.
We think that not allowing silence to be seen a suspicious only protects criminals who have nothing to say that would protect them on their own and we think that it like creates a like bad judicial system that is willing to defend individuals who don't have the words to protect themselves or physically don't have the facts to protect themselves.
Our second area of clash is about pragmatics because we think that it creates a really problematic incentive structure when we say that like the right to remain silent to something that exists because people who are guilty now have an incentive to stretch out trials because they know they can drag them out by continually pleading the fifth amendment.
If silence wasn't protected pleading the fifth would be bad for the accused which would encourage others either more honesty or end the proceedings entirely and make the whole system more efficient like we think it's a preferable world in which the incentive structure says like it is bad for you because this will harm you like this will make you look more suspicious and therefore it encourages people to do one of two things like either they're just going to tell the truth because they truly are innocent so they're going to say what their alibi was or they're going to explain why their absence of an alibi doesn't mean that they are guilty or they're going to lie but we actually think it's preferable when criminals lie as well because it is infinitely easier to fact check a lie than fact check a silence because we don't know what that silence means so we think that it's actually a lot more preferable to pack check like when individuals are lying and we actually think it leads to more efficient criminal proceedings because silence can place proceedings on hold because there's no way to disprove it so we think is actually preferable when we have a way of saying this is true or false here's the evidence here the facts and now we move on.
Proud to propose."
"We should limit the right to self-defense.
Self-defense is a necessary right within an individual framework.
When individuals cannot strike back against those who hit them in the first place, they will face infinite harm, but if we do not limit self-defense, we let other individuals who are pose a real threat or posed only an optical threat to they themselves face infinite harm.
Because we think that proportional and meaningful self-defense is good but all other self-defense is bad, we would propose the following model: that the united states federal government require individuals to run first when posed with a threat, to leave particular areas if they feel threatened, and to have called the police, and if they've exhausted both of those options, to have a proportional response to threats against them.
We will allow individuals to stay still or to take a few steps back to constitute running away, but we would generally require some harm to be taken first or a active weapon to be present for any response to actually occur.
What we mean by this is if someone is protesting in the park and someone approaches them and threatens to punch them, until the other person has raised their fist, nothing can be done.
Similarly, we would say that if they raised their fist, it would be unjust to then shoot them as it is necessarily not proportional.
Now, rather than individually argue this point, I want to ask a singular question: where do we get the right to self-defense and why is it only just if it is proportional and a last resort?
We think that the right to self-defense stems from the idea of harm minimization against culpable parties.
We think that harm to individuals who are trying to cause harm in the first place is okay, however, we think that that harm must be minimized as much as possible.
So, three reasons why this improves this sort of right.
First, we think that running away improves the ability to identify culpability.
If individuals see someone walking towards them or generally who may be following them and they stay still, they don't know if that person is just walking down their path or chasing them.
We think that running away, taking a different direction than you initially thought you would take allows you to confirm culpability.
In doing so, we minimize harm to non-culpable targets.
Secondly, though, we think that you can determine the extent of culpability by running first, and then responding proportionately.
We think that this, first, reduces your culpability, because if you strike back against someone who they themselves are unarmed or or who had no intent to harm you in the first place, they have similar access to self-defense and a right to self-defense, and then harm will happen to two parties who had no intention of hurting each other in the first place.
Similarly, we would say that it is only just for individuals to strike back if they themselves have been struck in the first place.
We think that it is important that these responses are equal.
It would be unjust if someone took a a dime from me that I wanted to spend myself, however, if I shot them in the back, it would be similarly unjust because I have then become culpable for a far more problematic action.
Third and finally, we think it's about minimizing total harm.
By acting proportionally and ensuring you run first, you will minimize harm against you and the aggressor.
We think the aggressor still has some rights toward security and life and as such, this must be protected.
The second way where we get the right to self-defense is how individuals stand in for the state when there's a direct and immediate harm.
We think that the this legal recognition of the right to self-defense provides individuals legal power to respond, but we must act under the similar assumptions of state power.
The same way in which you would condemn police officers who shot someone who is simply running away or shot someone who's only, say, stealing a newspaper, we think that individuals must they themselves understand that they're acting under the aegis of the state when they act legally to defend themselves, and we must ensure culpability to guarantee that all parties are justly served by the state.
For this reason, we should limit the right to self-defense."
"We should limit freedom of speech.
What we mean by this is that we would keep limits from the status quo things like slander, things that could present a clear and present danger like yelling fire in a crowded theater, and we would also add to this limitations on things like hate speech and other inflate inflammatory language.
Two main areas of clash, first on why the freedom of speech is not an infinite right.
Recognize that rights exist as an equalizing structure.
Everyone ought have equal access because everybody has them equally regardless of your race, your gender, or any other identifying characteristic.
It is defined by humanhood, not on any other identity.
The problem is becomes when you are applying a right infinitely, especially with something like speech, is that it compromises other peoples' access to more basic aspects of other rights that they might have.
People can still sufficiently self express without using hate speech, slander, or speech that presents a clear or present danger.
Things that like call you to hurt someone else or calls to action against a certain like person or body and we think that what the difference becomes is that although you can still sufficiently express yourself, the person who you have threatened might have a threat to their personal security so the right to life or threat to their own freedom of speech to a more extreme degree because they can't express anything about themselves once you have silenced them to such an amount.
I think at the point that we shown you that these kinds of things are limited or are potentially limited, we think the way in which they interact in reality allows us to legally limit them in order to protect individuals who cannot protect themselves.
This is why we do things like have governments in the first place because otherwise you would just have a bunch of people running around with the strongest one beating everybody else up and requiring their possessions and whatever else is good.
But our second area of clash is about the prioritization of societal good because even if you don't buy that this is an if this is a right that we can limit, even if you think it is infinite, we think what you probably don't think is that would you probably would agree with is that we prefer a society that is functional and protects other people over one in which a minority get to exercise all of their rights but nothing else works.
So a world in which every single movie theater was constantly in fear of having someone yell fire and have a stampede out the door is probably a world in which movie theaters can't function very well.
Apply this to everything when it comes to government.
So if people could just infinitely do things like slander others and slander politicians and have that taken as truth and have no recourse against them it would be incredibly difficult as it almost is in the status quo to figure out what is true and what is not true.
We think that we care more about marginalized groups' feelings and their ability to feel safe than groups that are already in power exercising free speech.
Hate speech silences minorities and limits their right to travel and other such things by making certain areas off limits.
You don't want to validate those viewpoints by giving them a free space because it empowers them to continue doing so and make more and more people unhappy and unsafe into the long term.
So arguments that say who cares we still think they ought be able to say what they think are probably untrue because who cares if they sat what they think if what they think is actively detrimental to someone else.
This is why we do things like not allowing mislabelling of products by corporations because we don't care if that corporation thinks their product is going to do things like make your hair shine infinitely.
If that's unproven you cannot put that down with full authority.
We think that this applies to humans as well because who knows how you can tell the difference between someone lying or someone saying a belief if those two things are the same thing so when you have politicians who do things like feed into white nationalists by talking about the danger that immigrants present even if those politicians don't believe it oftentimes the people who spout that nonsense do but we ought to treat both equally regardless of whether they are expressing free speech in either regard.
We think the burden is on op to show us some place to show us why this right is absolute where as all we have to do is show you a a example of where it isn't absolute given that this is just a question of whether or not we should limit free speech.
Proud to propose."
"We should ban gambling.
So, just to be clear in this debate, we're not talking about regulating like small poker games, between friends in their house, and coming with the police and breaking those up.
We don't really care about that in this debate.
What we're talking about is the institution and the market of gambling.
So what we're going to do specifically is we're going to shut down three different avenues.
We're going to shut down all casinos, we're going to end lotteries done by the state, and we're going to end online sports, and other types of gambling, that are done online.
So, if people bet on events, this this often occurs with sports, but it also occurs, for example, there are betting markets for politics, there are betting markets on the economy itself.
These are usually in the form of futures, we're going to ban all sort of speculative gambling on events in the world.
So, there are websites that host these things, we'd shut down those websites, and of course there would be hefty penalties if any of these things were violated.
Okay, two main arguments, the first is about the inefficient use of capital, and the second is about addiction, and why that's so problematic.
So, firstly, we would say that gambling is a non productive use of spending, it's a non productive use of assets, and what this means is that, when people spend their money on gambling, when they spend their money in order to gamble, there's no productive gain, that is derived from that, there's no creation of more assets, there's no creation of an accumulation of value.
It's simply using your assets to try and get the assets of someone else, and this isn't a productive use of capital, and what's more important is that these games are fundamentally rigged.
In order to have a profitable casino, in order to have a profitable lottery, or any type of thing, these games need to be devised in such a way, in which it is possible for a small amount of people to win, but the vast majority of people are mathematically going to lose.
And what this means is that gambling amounts, essentially, to a massive wealth transfer from poor individuals, who are the ones that are more likely to be gambling, to richer individuals.
Whether this takes the form of the state hosting the lottery, or it takes the form of ownership casinos, or gambling sites in which the casinos always win or these gambling sites take a percentage.
And what this means is that there's a net social harm, because capital is being transferred from the poor to the wealthy, which means the worst off become more worst off fundamentally en mass, from gambling, and we think that this creates a social issue that the state has an obligation to address, in the form of banning gambling.
And again, this isn't something that you can just regulate, to take away these effects, it is a fundamental part of gambling, that the poor lose money to the rich, and that there is a transfer of wealth that is regressive in nature, and we think that is a reason that the government needs to step in, and stop this.
Secondly, on addiction.
So addiction may not gambling addiction may not be a widely discussed issue, but it is a problem that many people experience, and we think that banning gambling, at least in this institutional sense, is more likely to stop people from becoming addicted in the first place, and gambling addiction can have real very problematic long term outcomes.
Whether this comes in the form of people putting forward a vast majority of their assets, in order to continue to gamble, in a way that ultimately can harm, not just themselves, but any other member of their household, or people that do business with this individual.
And furthermore, if people have a gambling addiction they can be driven underground, into gambling in arenas, in which you could have real violations of your bodily autonomy, and real harms, physical harms brought onto an individual, if they don't pay their debts.
And gambling gambling addiction in particular creates a cycle, in which you continue to gamble in order to try and remake the money that you've lost.
So, this is a really severe problem, that we think the government ought to address.
Gambling has no net social utility.
It is an unproductive use of capital, and it is a harm to those that end up becoming involved in gambling in the long run.
And for these reasons, we should ban gambling."
"We should abolish the US electoral college.
So for those who don't know, the american president is not elected by the american people.
Instead, the american people vote for representatives to go from their state to a group called the electoral college, who then select the president amongst themselves.
We have a few reasons why we think this practice should be abolished and replaced with a nationwide popular vote.
First, we tell you that the electoral college is fundamentally undemocratic.
Why is this so?
The way that seats are allocated in the electoral college is that every state gets one seat according to the number of representatives and senators they have.
This is a problem because every state gets two senators, and because the smaller states are still guaranteed at least one representative.
What that means is that each electoral college person in california represents hundreds of thousands of people whereas in wyoming, they likely only represent a couple tens of thousands of people.
Some people's votes count as much as five or six times more than other people's votes, and we think that this is fundamentally antithetical to the idea of liberal democracy.
We think that people in california deserve the same representation by the president as people in wyoming.
And recognize that because of the way the system is set up, people don't even campaign in many of the most populous states, like new york, texas and california.
Ultimately, they ignore those voters to instead focus on people who are disproportionately powerful because of the electoral college, like voters in iowa and ohio.
So those people have a huge amount of say and control over the president's policies and the future of the country relative to the vast majority of people, who live in safe states like california, that will always go to one particular party.
Our second argument is that we think the electoral college causes unnecessary conflict and degradation of democracy in the united states.
If you'll recall, in the two thousand election, george bush and al gore sued each other and ultimately, the new president was selected by the supreme court rather than any elected body.
The reason why this is so was that the electoral college is vague and its proceedings don't make any sense.
States allocate their electors according to a winner-takes-all principle, which means that a difference of two hundred votes in florida, which is a rounding error in a state of twenty million people, ultimately decided the presidential election.
At that point, it's up to courts to recount votes if they're challenged by the candidates and ultimately, you lead to months-long, very expensive recount processes that wouldn't need to take place in the event of a popular vote, because no president has ever won the national popular vote by two hundred votes, but that often happens in given states.
But not only does it create conflict in that sense, it also creates conflict in the sense that many people living in larger states are resentful and are more willing to back politicians in other sectors, such as the senate and house of representatives, who will represent their interests at the expense of the nation, because they don't feel represented by the president.
So we think this undermines cooperation and also the perception of fairness in american democracy, and that this is very likely one reason why the US has chronically low voter turnout.
The final reason we should abolish the electoral college, and this seems so obvious that I'm shocked that such intelligent men as james madison let the system go into effect, is that it allows for ties.
Right now, if the electoral college is tied, then the senate, I believe, breaks the vote, not important who, someone in the legislature.
But why would you have a system for choosing the president that allows for ties?
You don't allow even numbers of people on corporate boards, you don't have an even number of judges on things like american idol.
It just seems tremendously foolish to allow such an ineffective metric for choosing the president.
And the other team may say that ties are unlikely, but they're certainly not impossible, especially given that some states always vote in a particular direction.
We think that this shortcoming alone should be enough reason to get rid of the electoral college.
For these reasons, it should be abolished.
Thank you."
"Should adopt blasphemy laws.
So in this round we're gonna say that as a model for this debate that we should have strong laws against religious based libel.
So there are already laws that exist regarding liable.
We would strengthen those laws when it comes to libel against religious groups, against people because of their religion.
In addition, we think that you would expand the scope under which libel can be applied from just from things like journalists to just general people making libelous comments on things such a social media.
So expanding the scope of libel as well as strengthening the punishment.
Few reasons why we think this should be the case.
The first is the personal nature of religion.
As opposed to many other qualities that a person takes on, religion is a quality that is incredibly personal as in terms of beliefs.
While there are other inalienable qualities like someone's race or their gender that is not chosen in such a way as religion is, though for many people religion is something that they are born into rather than something they choose, but even even in compared to things other personal beliefs that we take on that we choose religion is incredibly personal because it doesn't just guide our way of viewing one particular sphere of our lives but rather as a moral compass by which we we point the direction of all of our actions.
Your belief in a higher deity in the moral the moral system that comes with that deity is a way that you view that you should live your life and is something that you believe is the moral way to live and so insulting a religion in a libelous way and degrading a religion in a libelous way is something that degrades not only individuals that are a part of that religion, but the very moral fabric by which they live their lives and again attacks on a religion are attacks on groups of people.
So in much the same way that we have hate crimes laws because if you burn a cross in a black person's yard in the united states it's not just an attack on that person it's an attack on the entire group of people.
It's meant to make that group of people feel lesser, in the case in that example feel fear, but in other ways to degrade that group of people, to belittle them, to make them feel like they're not someone to be accepted within society.
For example, when people make libelous claims about muslims in the united states it's not just insulting their moral beliefs but it's also it's also insinuating certain things that are made are meant to make them feel excluded from larger american society society and thirdly you can thirdly, we think of these laws are justified because you're still allowing people to privately believe what they want.
If you want to believe that muslims are all a certain stereotype in that certain rumors you've heard or certain certain conspiracy theories that you've heard about them as a group are correct, you've the right to believe those things.
But once you go and put that put that belief into the public sphere and in which you either publish it somewhere or you speak it in a public space, these are things that then start to exclude those within society rather than just being your expression of your thoughts.
It's your expression of your thoughts to the degradation of other people's ability to live freely and to live a satisfied and a comfortable life and finally, you can still criticize religion as a concept.
We're not saying that religion should be above all criticism but we're saying that when your criticism is based on lies, when your criticism is based on stereotyping or deceit, we think that that criticism is no longer valid and at that point it shouldn't be protected as free speech.
Once you're attacking a group of people and lying about an organization and a group of people, we think that that becomes an attack again as we've stated on their moral standing.
It becomes an attack on their way of life, a way of excluding them and meaningfully impacts their ability to express their freedoms as protected as citizens within our country and for these reasons, we should adopt blasphemy laws."
"The motion for today's debate is that suicide should be a criminal offense.
What we mean by this is that someone if someone is caught attempting suicide, they are taken before a judge and the judge is allowed to decide their sentence.
We would allow for more unconventional punishments as is currently allowed in the status quo, presumably a lot of the time this is going to be required therapy or outpatient facilities etcetera.
Three main areas of clash.
First, on how this forces people to get treatment.
Because recognize that in the status quo there isn't actually a way to force someone who is depressed or suicidal to put themselves into a facility, unless they bring up the self motivation to do so.
This is because every state currently respects self-autonomy up to the point when a family can prove that someone is not a rational actor.
This is very difficult to do, especially when you are working with older patients who have like who have shown themselves to be functioning adults in the past, etcetera.
What this means is that we have to have a way in a more effective way of getting people who clearly have a problem to seek help.
We think that first, the potential threat of having to face a criminal offense is, and like potential jail time, makes people less likely to attempt suicide in the first place.
But we think that if you do, having to go before a court, being assigned a punishment, etcetera, means that you are actually more like this is one hell of a wake-up call, and it's more likely to push you into finding treatment in the future, so as to not repeat this kind of experience.
Moreover, we think that in these situations, judges are much more likely to be lenient and push them into patient facilities, because it is currently pretty well known in society that depression and suicide is not something that is caused by anything that a person can necessarily control, but are rather caused by underlying mental illness.
More than this, we think that because there are no other people physically injured in the act, judges are more likely to be lenient because they don't need to be clocking jails up, like there's an incentive to keep people who shouldn't be in jail out of jail as much as possible.
And we think that even though sometimes we lose those conventions when it comes to people who might be doing very soft drugs, we think that there's still a lot of programming that judges have with regards to mental illness that will make them specifically more lenient.
Our second area of clash has to do with how it forces the system to reevaluate mental health as a form as a whole.
If you're suddenly getting an influx of depressed people in into your jails, then you have to start adjusting your system to deal with them, because otherwise you just end up with a lot of people rotting behind bars, which I guess technically already happens, but it's a lot more difficult to ignore them if these are people who are suffering from mental illnesses, or coming there for specific reasons.
We also think that even if that's not true, people who are the parents of these individuals or loved ones are much more likely to stick around than if you're just a hardened criminal, or someone who has committed low level crimes and probably comes from communities that care about you less.
So we think that there's actually going to be more accountability in prison systems or in juvenile detention centers, in that are hosting large amounts of attempted suicide survivors.
So at the point that this is true, we think that there are certain overflow benefits.
If you're going to be upping your mental health care specifically for these patients, you're also going to be upping it for the system as a whole, and so we think that currently a lot of people who have undiagnosed issues are much more likely to get treatment on our side of the house.
Our third argument is a little bit more sensitive, because we recognize that suicide is caused by underlying factors which is depression.
But the fact of the matter is that you're still killing a person in the process, and so currently, there are laws against killing or attempting to kill others, and I think the burden is on op to tell us why suicide is significantly different.
Like sure, there are underlying emotional issues, but this happens with a lot of murders but we still punish them.
The underlying principle is still ending the life of someone else, and that is criminal.
We need to thus discourage it in the same way, and we need to keep legal consistency in the same way.
If you're going to be killing someone else, you need to be treated the same way regardless of the of the underlying context.
This is the way that our current legal system operates, and it's unclear why we need to change that.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"Truth and reconciliation commissions bring more good than harm.
We think that it's first important recognize the context in which these things exist.
Truth and reconciliation commissions exist in post conflict societies, societies that are coming out of things like civil wars or mass atrocities.
Situations in which oftentimes structural issues - forced conflicts, divisions between groups of people, forced violence on both sides and where there's no correct side.
Maybe one side has come out victorious but there is no right moral side.
These are often situations such as in rwanda, the former, or south africa, in which apartheid occurred, in which violence occurred on both sides, and in which we don't think that it's that it's possible to prosecute every perpetrator.
The reason for this is that these things occur on a massive scale, which means that there may be hundreds or thousands of foot soldiers on the ground that have committed these acts, that need to be punished, but you have a legal system that is usually in its nascent stage.
These are usually new societies and new governments that are hosting the TRC's and as such, if you were to have trials for all these people, we don't think it would be possible to get through all these people.
We think what the more likely scenario is, is that either trials will be rushed, in which case you can't ensure that justice is actually carried out, or these trials will be faked.
Or the trials will be prejudiced in certain ways, in which you also can't ensure justice is carried out, or people never face trials, which means that victims never get the closure that they need and ever get the help they need.
So we think that there are two reasons why TRC's are incredibly good in post conflict societies.
The first is that it prioritizes healing over vengeance.
Trials aren't built to include this type of healing that is necessary in post conflict societies.
Trials by their very nature are combative, they don't allow for families and for victims to speak unless it is entirely necessary for proving the guilt of an individual, they don't seek information out.
So information about mass grave sites, about how atrocities were carried out, things that allow for closure to be possible victims.
If these things aren't a part of the plan for prosecution and for a conviction, these things never get out.
Which means that victims are never given the information, the apology, the things they need to heal and move on.
And this is crucial because in these post conflict societies, it's not like the divisions that existed during conflict disappear but rather these communities need to learn how to live with each other moving forward.
We think that when you have a system in which one group is overwhelmingly tried because the other group is likely to be the one in power and hosting those trials, we think this only deepens the this only deepens the tension that exists, and it means that individuals are only angry at each other on both sides.
TRC's also allow for discourse.
When you're not in a combative nature of a trial, you can learn to understand why the other side behaved the way it did and it can learn, it can teach people to humanize the people that had previously been their enemies.
We think that this is crucial again because these groups are going to need to live together in the future.
The second reason why TRC's are preferable is because they're actually possible.
Recognized that a commitment to retribution is not fully possible.
There's no way to convict all the people that you're going to get.
These trials are going to be problematic if you try and cram through every individual.
It only increases these existing tension and because of this we can that TRC's are a balance between the justice that people want, it ensures that people are made fully aware of the actions they've done wrong.
People are forced to explain what they did, people are forced to acknowledge the harms that they've done, not only for themselves but for their victims, and it ensures that a a society broadly blame isn't placed on one side.
It ensures that all people get the chance to express their feelings and express their grief.
And while it may not lead to the blood thirsty revenge that some people want after these atrocities have been committed, that doesn't lead to future healing.
That only leads to more crime in the future and especially when these crimes or in, when these crimes occur on a mass scale, we don't think that it is worthwhile to have retribution over rehabilitation.
Both socially and for individuals.
And for this reason we believe that truth and reconciliation commissions bring more good than harm."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should privatize social security in the united states.
Three independent points but first a quick model.
So we'll allow essentially individuals to either do one of two things: either fully consent out of the social security system and just agree not to pay into it but in exchange not receive benefits, or secondarily have their account privately managed by a firm that would presumably be selected in much the same way that government contracts are generally awarded through, a bidding process that is then given to you know the lowest bidder.
So onto three independent points.
The first is that the private sector is more efficient.
This is because the private sector isn't addled by bureaucracy that holds back the quality decision making and new blood that allows the private sector to operate efficiently.
This is important.
Social security is often managed by people that have worked for the government for a long time.
Things like seniority determine decision making capacity and rises in power, rather than their actual qualities as a leader or their efficacy in you know achieving specific goals.
The private sector works fundamentally differently.
It rewards people with leadership roles when they do things that actually get good returns, when they actually make decisions that benefit the corporation.
And specifically we think we can apply this to social security, specifically the investments arm of social security, by rewarding people for making good investment decisions and good management decisions.
Currently the social security administration is addled by bureaucracy that holds it back from its full potential.
We think the private sector can meet that potential.
And this brings me into my second point, that the private sector would be more willing to take risks, so a lot of the funding for social security comes from investments that are made into it.
Obviously if this was just like a money pool that people like flatly put their money into the fund would actually depreciate because of inflation.
So right now the social security administration is only permitted to take very very safe bets that is blue chips things like that.
But the problem is that there is often a conflation between safe bets and risky bets as seeing that risky bats are you know risking a collapse essentially for the fund.
That's often not true because if you have a well diversified portfolio that contains some risky bets, then you can insure large growth within the portfolio sometimes and relatively stable growth held down by the section of your portfolio that's invested in blue chips and the like.
That in turn means that investments can grow faster under private management because there aren't these electoral and political incentives to only take what's perceived to be very safe you know decisions.
And as such when you have a faster growing portfolio you are able to pay more money out to the people who need it later in life.
I think insofar as we see the social security system as existing to benefit the elderly and others who like that people with disabilities that benefit from the money that's in this pool, we want the people to be as large as possible to maximize the benefit that can be given to them, especially if we can grow that pool without increasing taxation.
This last bit there about increasing taxation leads me into my third and final point, that allows opt outs in our system.
We think that fundamentally social security shouldn't be a mandatory system, especially because at least in principle the amount of money you get out of it is directly related to the amount of money that you put into it.
At that point then we think that a lot of people you know basically can manage their that money personally through their like own investment skills or whatever, and as such we think we should give them the option to do so.
That is we should allow people to make the active decisions about whether or not they want to invest in a particular fund with that money rather than simply putting it into social security where it will not grow very substantially.
Increasing that choice isn't just you know something that's tied to someone's individual self-interest, it's also tied to their property rights because it's their money.
We think that that's that choice then, that ability to opt out, is really important.
Proud to propose."
"This house would ban telemarketing.
What we mean by this is that campaigns that use the telephone and cold calling people to sell their products would no longer be allowed.
You could obviously still have areas in which an individual has to call a certain number to make a purchase but you would not be able to specifically market using the telephone like product as we currently have in the status quo.
Three main areas of clash, first on why this is just generally a really problematic way of attempting to sell things.
I think what we have to recognize is that telemarketing relies on this idea that there are individuals who are going to be either tired enough or uninformed enough or don't have enough time to do their research to make a purchase at the moment that someone is calling their door.
We think that it's actually really really coercive in that it basically tells people like look we're catching you in this situation in which maybe you're less comfortable maybe you're in the middle of a like a private matter or in the middle of your everyday life and we're going to use the opportunity to try and sell you something and we think that like even if this isn't something that is intrinsically bad insofar as there are many many or like legally bad insofar as there are many many ways for individuals to sell products in other ways especially with the invention of things like the internet we don't understand why it is necessary to have something like telemarketing which tries to playoff of individuals' weaknesses.
We especially think that it gets worse when we recognize it compounds with preexisting things such as targeted advertisement we think that given that individuals are going to be bombarded with imagery of things they probably don't need but might have mentioned that they want either way we think it's problematic that they can also be targeted over the phone.
Our second area of clash is just that it's annoying.
We think that insofar as governments exist to protect the average citizen and we think that these protections can come in many forms not just in terms of security we don't think that there's anything that telemarketing accomplishes that other forms of sale cannot so we don't understand why it's like an unfair limitation on the market rather we think it's the government just being like look even if this isn't like personal to the safety of our citizens it's still something that brings them a significant amount of distrust and irritation so we might as well keep them from having to experience this and we think the problem is that even telemarketers don't like telemarketing when it happens to themselves.
So and and given that this isn't something that we think is at a significant drop off in jobs insofar as these kinds of jobs just transferred to the other form of marketing that occurs we don't think there's actually any kind of real harm to stopping this as a practice and so the fact that it is like incredibly irritating to individuals and not something that anyone wants to deal with becomes incredibly important and outweighs the majority of anything else in this round because there aren't any harmful impacts on op's upside.
So it makes it something that is essentially just like look like if there's a situation that sucks and you're able to change that situation without actually harming anyone else you probably ought change that situation.
Finally though, we want to talk about the insecurity of telemarketing because we think that in a world where individuals are recording our voices and using them to access our bank accounts and other voice activated media in a world in which they are listening in conversations to listen to things like our car so like our cards we have to recognize that telemarketing corporations usually don't have the money to do things like secure the lines that they are using like make sure that nobody is recording the speech that is being said and so we think that something that happens that is really problematic on their side of the house is that telemarketing campaigns are always more easily hacked than the alternatives which poses a massive security threat to the individuals who might buy something via telemarketing.
Insofar as that is true we think that we ought differ to the things that are more secure so that we don't take these kinds of risks in the first place.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abandon social media.
What we mean is that, it would be a better preferable world, if people didn't use social media to the extent that they do today.
To main areas of clash, the first we think the isolation of people from each other, and from society at large, is massively caused by social media, and is also massively problematic.
We think that social media and the use thereof often leads first to the loss of communication, but second to an inability to communicate.
We think that rather than learning to interact with people, you hide behind your screens and behind your messages, but more so, that social media provides you with this false solvency, and this idea that you don't have to interact with people.
Why should I go and meet up with my friends, when I can read about their lives on facebook?
Why should I crave social interaction, when I can fill my mind, and my day, with a fake social interaction by looking online?
But we also think that, what this does is leads to difficulty in communication itself.
People have more difficulty approaching each other personally with conflicts, when they can ponder every word, and type it out through messenger.
But more than this, miscommunications are much more likely as well.
I can't add inflection, tone, sarcasm, or my facial expressions, to a message, and oftentimes emojis just aren't enough.
This leads to those hours that people spend agonizing over, whether he meant that seriously, sarcastically, whether that period is because he's angry, or whether he just chose to put a period.
We think, what this does is essentially distances people from each other, raises the anxiety associated with social interaction, and then prevents you from ever actually reaching it.
But also, we think the political echo chambers, and political polarization caused by social media, is also very problematic.
We think that, a lot of people get their news from things like facebook, twitter, tumblr, subscribing to different channels, reading the articles that your friends share.
The problem with this is a combination of tracking and targeted ads and articles, and then also who your friends are.
We think at the point that facebook can just isolate me as a generally liberal, feminist college student, they're only going to be showing me articles that I am attracted to, based on those characteristics.
But then, take it a step further, most of my friends are also liberal feminist college students, who are going to have very similar opinions to myself.
This means, I very rarely have any sort of exposure to the alternate point of view.
This is problematic on a face value level, because it's good to have interaction with other arguments, other opinions, and knowing what those opinions are, but also problematic, because you get the general feeling that everyone in the world thinks the same way as you do, because that's all you see on your newsfeed.
It's the only exposure you're getting.
Secondly to this though, we think this also spreads misinformation.
At the point that fake news is becoming an actual epidemic, the use of social media to get your news, the reading of facebook statuses to learn about the recent political climate, or how your friends are voting, is a problem, because it means you never actually getting an objective news source on what is actually going on.
This trade off, between social media and actual news, is dangerous and we think abandoning social media pushes people more towards true news sources.
Our second area of clash is about how people live through social media.
We think that at this point in time, people structure their lives around snapchat posts, and one upping everyone else around them.
Because, if they' that person looks like they're having more fun than you on social media, you have to show that you are up to par.
We think what this leads to is an expectation to constantly have a happy and exciting life, which leaves no room for things like mental health issues, or anxiety, or anything that typical people experience, but never see their peers experiencing anymore, because it's not acceptable to show that side of you on social media.
We think that this is really problematic, insofar as real people do have problems, more than this though, we think that people often begin to value the media standing above deep relationships, and it forces the creation of multiple fake personas, rather than actually creating strong relationships with individual people, because you're collecting the likes on facebook.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should adopt multiculturalism.
When we're talking about multiculturalism what we mean is that we should have a state that accepts many different cultures and the living side by side of these cultures.
These cultures don't necessarily need to diffuse within each other or blend in any meaningful way but we think that multiculturalism means that cultures of different backgrounds, of different nationalities, of different political ideologies, are able to live side by side within society.
We think that there are two main reasons that this should be the case.
The first is that we believe it is simply in the nature of a just state to allow for multiculturalism to arise and second, we think there are numerous social benefits that arise from a from a multicultural society.
So firstly on the just state.
We would say that the state is a fundamentally coercive actor and this is because the state is not able to gain meaningful consent from the people that it governs.
There's no way for me as a citizen of the state to go and give my tacit consent and if I were to not consent to a state, there's no way for me to opt out of the state apparatus altogether.
It's very difficult to move and even if I were to move there's no way for me to just move out of state control altogether.
So no matter what, the state has some degree of coercion.
The state makes up for that by and becomes just by allowing for individual liberty in individual freedom.
The nature of allowing for individual liberty is that laws are based upon limiting third party harms and allowing the populace to flourish.
It means that you create laws to ensure that you maximize the whole societal level of freedom.
So you create laws such as laws against murder, because to undertake that act as an act of your individual liberty, restricts the individual liberty of other peoples that you are doing harm upon.
That is what's creating the third party harm.
We think that the extension of that is to allow for all cultures to freely flourish.
To defend one culture over another, to defend one moral system over another in regards to things that don't have to do with direct third parties harms, we think is the state overstepping its bounds and exceeding what it means to be a just state.
By by defining one culture as the primary culture and holding it up you lower the ability of other people to express their individual their individual freedom, to express their personal beliefs, to take part in the culture that they most closely associate with and in doing so you create a less just state overall.
So we think that if the state is to be just, it must be multicultural.
So secondly, on social benefits outside of the philosophical ideas of a just state.
We think that multiculturalism does a few things.
Firstly, it brings new ideas into largely model cultural states and refreshes the marketplace of ideas and creates new ideas, new ways of looking at the world within our public discourse, new things that we may want to choose to value, and new ideas of how we should address certain problems by bringing new historical perspectives.
This is important because the current system in many western states is stagnant and it's become rather hostile between existing ideas creating partisan ideologies and creating disputes that we think new ideas a multicultural approach could help to solve.
Secondly, contact theory.
Contact theory is the idea that if you are able to interact with the people that you perceive as the other, to interact with those that you otherwise wouldn't perceive as human beings but only learned of through stereotypes and third party accounts, if you're able to interact with those people as human beings you're able to see them as fully fleshed out persons and come to understand them as more similar to you than dissimilar to you.
What this means we think is that when you create a multicultural society you're more likely to create individuals within that society that are tolerant of other beliefs, that are more likely to be kind hearted in their approach towards other states and towards other people's and we think that you create a more hospitable society for all members that live within that society.
We think you get better community relations when people are more tolerant of each other and a more open society that allows for ideas to freely flow between between communities and we think that this is a society that is allowed to flourish the most.
For these reasons, we should adopt multiculturalism."
"We should abandon democracy.
Now by this I don't mean that we should set up some king to tell everyone what to do but that we should have a government in which certain experts and other political figures are outside of the power of the people in order to ensure that poor decisions aren't made by the democratic body.
We think that this might take the form of a party that runs parallel to the nation's government for instance such as the one that we see in china today or the soviet union historically which can guide the country towards prosperity and economic growth even if people make poor decisions in the short term which they often do.
Our first argument is that there is an urgent need to combat climate change and that the globe's populace are unwilling to do so.
Recognize that most people alive right now will never face the biggest harms of climate change.
If you're forty something today by the time major climate change kicks in you you will have been dead for sometime.
Even young people right now are unlikely to see the full effects.
However real people are going to suffer, future people are going to suffer because of climate change.
Entire countries like bangladesh are going to be inundated with water and hundreds of millions even billions of refugees will be split across the globe if something isn't done immediately.
It's clear that radical action is needed and it's clear that democratic countries are unwilling to accept any change to their quality of life in order to fight global climate change, even though that's exactly what's needed.
The current western standard of living is unsustainable without massive changes in technology and government policy and that just isn't happening in the current status quo because of democracy.
People vote based on their belly and their wallet, not what's good for the future of the globe and that's why we need technocrats to make these decisions for us.
There needs to be some body that isn't accountable to the lowest common denominator who can say we must cut carbon emissions so we're going to spend public money on nuclear reactors and we're okay with cutting off people's electricity sometimes or making it harder to buy a car if that means that there's going to be less climate change in the long term.
Ultimately saving millions of lives is worth it even if it means taking away some political freedom in the short term and we think that climate change uniquely creates the impetus to do this as soon as possible especially in the most powerful countries like the US.
We think it's no coincidence that china is building thousands of nuclear reactors at a time when the US hasn't built any in forty years and it's because their government can act in the greater good even when the citizen body doesn't want them to.
And our second argument is that democracies are often worse for people's freedom then a benign dictatorship and remember that what I'm proposing is a parallel undemocratic system.
We're fine with letting people have some voice but we think that ultimately technocrats should have a lot of say.
We think that for instance the rise of fascism in the twentieth century shows the weaknesses of democracy.
Democracies only protect people's rights inasmuch as that's in the interests of fifty one percent of the people.
If fifty one percent of your people want to vote in fascists who will get rid of all of the jews then that's what's going to happen and people say oh that'll never happen again but I think it's obvious from the election of populists around the globe that democracies are easily manipulated and that people will vote for racist or bigoted governments.
In the past we've seen democracies with great democratic approval invade other countries and cause millions of deaths like the US did by invading iraq.
Moreover we think it's quite likely that democracies are more prone to bias such as racism than these technocrats will be presuming that we pick good technocrats to begin with.
Moreover because racism is ultimately harmful to a country's economy and culture these technocrats have an incentive not to be racist whereas the public is just driven by whatever whims they happen to have.
So because we can better fight climate change which is an existential threat and because it will be less racist we would prefer some sort of philosopher kinddom to democracy.
Thank you."
"We should legalize prostitution.
So I want to first start out by recognizing the problem that exists in the status quo which is that in the status quo, the ban on prostitution is massively ineffective.
It leads to the criminalization of marginalized communities above all else, and it means that when women or men enter the field of prostitution largely because of factors outside of their control because of economic restraints placed on them that force them to go into these markets, they're punished.
Rather than even if you believe that this is a moral issue prostitutes are punished rather than johns and pimps, the people that cause massive abuses which will talk about later.
So two reasons why we think we should legalize prostitution.
The first is that the law is unjust and the second is that the abuses of the status quo outweigh any sort of moral claims that are made in favor of the law.
So why is the law unjust?
Recognize that prostitution isn't some new fangled invention of modern times.
It's not some new part of humanity.
It's one of the oldest jobs, one of the oldest professions in the world.
It's something that is a basic core of our humanity and whether we like it or not, the sexuality of humanity, our desire to have this companionship, to have the sexual intimacy with other people even if it comes at a price is something that is a part of our nature and is not something that we can simply ignore by legislating against it.
We also think that there are no clear external harms of prostitution.
What we mean by this is that when two adults consent into a contract that leads to them having sex, as is the case in prostitution, there's no harm on outside or third parties that is created by this interaction.
It means that there are two adults that recognize what they're consenting into, that it fully consented into doing this and just because there's a monetary interaction it doesn't mean that there's any sort of new harm being created in the same way that when any two people choose to have consensual intercourse there's no third party harm created in that.
The only difference is an exchange of money and we don't think that this exchange of money is something that justifies making such an action illegal.
We also think that the right to bodily autonomy must be absolute.
We think that if people are not able to have absolute control over how they use their body in what they use or what they do with their body we can that fundamentally undermines the freedom that the government exists to protect and in doing so this law undermines the entire purpose of the government.
We think that if you want to keep it out of sight you can regulate prostitution.
You can regulate it in the way that you can regulate other markets so that any sort of moral qualms you have with it aren't spread outside to the public but this doesn't mean you have to ban it altogether and it doesn't mean you have to criminalize it in the way it's done in the status quo which caused the abuses that I'm going to talk about now.
In the status quo there's no way for prostitutes to protect against the abuses of pimps, johns, and we think they deserve this protection as citizens.
Prostitutes can be horribly abused by their pimps.
They can be abused by johns and they can johns can refuse payment to them, they can do things like give them STD's without any sort of recourse.
We think that just because these people choose to enter into a profession that something is morally questionable doesn't mean that these people don't deserve the protections of any other citizen and any other person that is currently being employed.
We also think that women have been historically stripped of their autonomy.
That the patriarchal society that we live in is one that restricts women's ability to do what they want with their bodies and with their lives.
We think that should end.
We think that in our current society, if women choose to enter the field of prostitution, if women choose to do this and if two consenting adults choose to enter into a contract in which there is an exchange of goods in this way, we don't think there's any harm to society at large.
We don't think there's any justification for the government restricting these types of things and for these reasons, we should legalize prostitution."
"We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms.
In the united states guns have caused incredible amount of harm to the whole of society due to the lives that they have taken, the accidents they have caused, the crime that is intrinsically and directly linked to gun violence, and the intimidation effects involved with open carry laws in the status quo.
Because we think that guns are so deeply ingrained in the US culture, it is essential for government to be the only actor who can step in for the US federal government to meaningfully strike back against the right to keep and bear arms.
We would as such propose the following model: that in the united states, a gun buyback program would be instituted.
We'll pay a little less than the market price for any given gun, that is to say, any a little less than the price of a new gun.
It doesn't matter if your shotgun's a month old or ten years old, we'll pay the same price to get it back from you.
We don't want individuals have any reason to not want to bring back their guns.
We'll immediately criminalize the sale of guns and the sale of ammo.
Even if we don't have perfect efficacy in solving people who sell guns as we make it so ammo manufacturers simply cannot operate, we think that guns largely become unusable.
We would also makes guns illegal, the possession of guns illegal within two years allowing individuals to operate within the gun buyback program but making their possession a crime immediately afterwards.
We are also operating under the assumption there's a constitutional change involved that the popper proper regulation and legislation that has been passed to allow for the constitution to be changed.
Three arguments then for why this is a good idea.
First off on accidents.
Guns when in the hands of innocent individuals, still cause incredible amounts of harm.
Children who get guns largely hurt themselves or hurt neighbors.
A high powered weapon can shoot through a wall and kill someone.
There've been recorded stories of children playing with guns, pretending by pointing at other people, playing with them, in a the way that they've seen guns used in the past and as such, people dying.
We think government has an obligation to protect innocent individuals particularly children have an understanding of consequence or necessarily what they're doing at a given time and as such, it must ban guns.
May second argument is about crime.
Think that cheaper guns means cheaper crime.
We think that this policy raises the price of guns, incredibly raises the price of ammunition, and makes it risky for anyone to hold a gun at a given time.
As such, we think that in the status quo regular guns do not actually solve crime.
We think it's rare that people have guns and if someone pulls a gun on you, you don't really have a chance to take out your own gun without being shot.
As such, by criminalizing guns all that we do is make crime less effective, less effective for getting a lot of money in the short term, and as such, decrease the total amount of crime.
Secondarily though, we think it also makes policing harder when we have guns on the street.
That cops are likely to be violent.
We think that they're less likely to mobilize efficiently.
But even if they're still just as violent as before, we think that the optics of people not having guns anymore, the idea that juries can say there's no chance he had a gun because they're illegal means that more police will be tried for police brutality increasing the total amount of trust in cops from the public to increase.
My third argument is about intimidation.
We think that guns have been used to silence groups a lot of the time.
Open carry protests have been used in LGBTQ rallies and liberal protests as well where people walk with their signs but also with large guns strapped to their back.
These guns are a clear threat but cannot be solved in the status quo because there's a right to keep and bear arms.
It is essential then the government step in to protect free speech and guarantee individuals cannot use them as a tool of intimidation.
This policy clearly resolves this by making it so anyone who's openly or secretly carrying a gun can be arrested.
For this reason, we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms."
"We should protect internet privacy.
So, right off the top, we want to say that when we're talking about internet privacy, we're not just talking about government surveillance over the internet, we're also talking about the ability for businesses to capture your data and package that data, sell that data, their ability to take your information with or without your knowledge.
We think that all of this is is encompassed by internet privacy and all of it should be protected.
So, first and foremost, we believe that not only is a right to privacy legally recognized in many areas, but it's a right that should exist.
So, many courts globally recognize the right to privacy, whether it's the US supreme court, whether it's the european union's courts that have recognized a right to be forgotten, these are different courts that legally recognize that this right should exist.
And that's important in this debate, because if we're seeing that countries have said clearly that there is a right to privacy that should be respected, it means that that is a promise coming from the state that action will be taken to ensure that right.
It's something that the state has proclaimed for its citizens and therefore should be addressed.
And furthermore, we think that internet use is necessary.
People often give up their rights with little understanding of what they're doing, and they're often given limited choice, given social pressures.
Like when people say, "" oh, you just don't need to get a facebook account, don't need to get a twitter account, you don't need to be on social media, you don't need to have email with google, "" all these types of things, these are people that don't recognize that this type of technology is to modern day what a phone was to people in the nineteen eighties.
If you were if you were living in the nineteen eighties and you did not have a phone number to be so and people couldn't call you, that was a way to be ousted not just from being able to interact with people socially, but businesses wouldn't take you seriously.
There'd be no way to contact you.
There'd be no way to get in touch with you.
People become suspicious in this day and age if you're not online.
It seems like you're hiding something.
And online branding is often one way in which people show off their resume and get jobs, or it's a way that people build businesses for themselves.
And there are certain platforms, like facebook, that that have become so widely used that it's almost necessary, in order to have a social life, to be on these areas.
And facebook intentionally, facebook and other providers, like google and twitter, intentionally make their service their service agreements and terms of service difficult to understand and incredibly vague, so it allows them to capture data on you, even when you don't know they're doing it.
And this is why facebook has faced so much backlash recently, because information was being captured without people even knowing.
We think that the right to privacy is good.
We think that your data has value to it and you should be able to either monetize that data or keep it withheld, if you choose not to be turned into a product that other places can sell you.
We think that you also get a more secure internet and a more secure world overall if fewer places store your personal data.
It's not just that facebook has access to my personal data, but it's that all these apps that use facebook do as well.
It's that there are now dozens and dozens of places across the internet that have my personal information, and I have little way to have recompense against that.
And finally, we think that, this goes without saying, but government should certainly not have the ability to get personal data without a warrant.
This is a clear violation of your right of your rights in a legal system.
It's a clear violation of the right to due process and the right to the right to some sort of privacy in that sense and we think that, clearly, states should have to get warrants in order to get this information.
Current current practices clearly are unjust, but we think that that falls along the same lines of what we've said earlier and for all of these reasons, we should protect internet privacy."
"We should disband asean.
This is the association of southeastern asian nations.
So, members include countries like malaysia, indonesia, thailand and some of their neighbors.
These countries have a relatively large GDP when you add them all together, something approaching trillions of dollars, and we think that ultimately, when we say should, we mean on balance, it would be preferable to what exists now, it would be basically a good thing if it were disbanded.
So, the purpose of asean like, in name, is to promote growth and stability in southeast asia.
We're going to give you two arguments for why we think asean actually undermines those purposes and is a negative thing: so, first, we think that asean encourages economic stagnation.
Recognize that the world is rapidly changing, particularly right now.
We've seen recently the global financial crisis, increases in terrorism and international conflict and this is, generally speaking, a time of great change in the world after the nineteen-nineties were a time of relative peace.
So, what we see is that is slow to act and fundamentally conservative.
It seeks to preserve the status quo, it seeks to encourage things that have worked in the past, and ultimately, the outcome of this is that it prevents its members from taking swift action, be that economic or military action, in the face of crisis.
It encourages them to be very conservative in times when circumstances call for a bit of daring.
We think that this makes countries less flexible and that in the face of a rapidly changing world, it would be better if countries were more flexible, were swifter to face challenges than they are as a result of asean.
The other side might say that the organization can be reformed, but at that point, you're moving away from its core principles and you might as well just disband it.
We also think that there's a certain amount of bias in favor of the status quo, an assumption that just because things have been done a certain way in the past that that's how they ought to be done, inherent in asean's thinking.
It assumes that old economic strategies will work and it also assumes that stability is good.
We tell you that a certain amount of good change, of radical economic policy can work, particularly in these countries that have seen rapid growth in recent years, and on top of that, that stability is sometimes bad if that stability is keeping a harmful situation in place for a long period of time.
So, we think that asean is actually preventing good change and leading to stagnation.
Our second argument is that we think asean is fundamentally undemocratic.
So, two sub-points to this because we think that there are democratic and undemocratic nations affected differently by this organization.
So, in democratic countries like malaysia, where you have basically fair elections and people choose their government, we tell you that this limits the will of the people.
If they want to engage in a popular policy which is contrary to asean policy, they are bound by treaty not to do so, even if it's something that millions of people want to see happen.
So, this might mean the exploitation of local resources or seeking out new trade relations outside of the region.
We think that it is not a good idea for countries to limit the ability of their people to control policy because people know their own interest and should be allowed to vote in favor of it.
But we also see that asean props up dictatorships in countries like thailand or vietnam.
We think that it is unfortunate that the organization to preserve a status quo in which millions of people are not free and are having their rights violated.
We think that this is fundamentally disgraceful and that it's something that ought not continue.
Therefore, it would be better if the organization were disbanded so that there was no one trying to prop up stability for countries where the status quo is harmful and in cases, even evil.
We think, therefore, that asean harms people in member states either by limiting their democratic freedom if they live in a democratic society or by condemning them to continue to live in these dictatorships if they live in a less democratic society.
So, for this reason, it seems better if asean were to be dissolved rather than continued.
So, because it encourages stagnation and because it is harmful for the people who live in these countries, we should disband asean.
Thank you."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should abolish the electoral college.
In terms of the model, we would just transition over to a popular vote.
So just whoever gets the most votes across the country wins.
And obviously because of the electoral college only applies to presidential elections we would also only be applying this popular vote system to the presidential election.
Three independent points: first is that the electoral college can often result in the wrong result, essentially.
That we think that principally the person who gets the most votes across the country should become the president.
That person clearly enjoys the most support of the people, and our underlying principle in a democracy is there representative should be the ones that act on behalf of as many people as possible within that system.
So, it's bad then when a person that enjoys less support nationwide becomes the president.
The justification that's often offered for why the system endorsed by the electoral college happens and why were okay with someone with less votes becoming president, is geographic essentially.
That you know certain states are underrepresented because they have less people and then the electoral college basically allows the smaller states to get some sort of representation.
The problem though is that principally I just don't think that those states should have the same level of you know representation as states that are significantly larger.
The reason for this is essentially created you know by the fact that just majority vote matters.
That there's nothing about a a rural person that makes them any more worthy than you know a person living in a very urban state.
And at that point I don't think that there's a reasonable justification for allowing that outsized voice.
One prominent example is that in wyoming an individual just has about three times the influence on the presidential elections outcome than someone in california.
Because california, by virtue of how many people it has, just has less you know representation in the electoral college weighted out across its population.
This is, you know, pretty problematic the reason for why this happens is because you know the senate factors into the count of how many votes you get in the electoral college, so smaller states that still of two senators get a lot of votes.
All in all then I think there's a lot of problems in terms of representation that are created by the electoral college and the geographic justification doesn't really merit that disparity.
Second independent point is fraud, essentially.
That it is harder to commit on a national level, when you basically you have to alter the result by such a wider factor.
In the electoral college, the race can really come down to just like a small state, like a swing state basically, like ohio for example.
So what you really have to do to commit meaningful fraud in that case is alter result by a few thousand people in a swing state that decides the election.
On a national level however the margin is quite rarely that thin and the effort it would take take you know commit fraud is a significantly larger.
So we think it's easier to protect against you know problems like this in an electoral college system.
The last thing I want to talk about is wasted votes.
And or specifically votes that aren't recognized properly.
And I think there's a lot of ways in which this happens: the first is just that you have people in heavily red or blue states that are in the opposition voice, whose voices are really hurt by virtue of the electoral college.
So democrats in texas, for example, don't really have any reason to cast a ballot.
The same goes for republicans in say new york.
This is, that this is a problem it's not just unfair that these people's voices aren't really listened to, but it also depresses turnout, which has its own benefits like civic engagement.
But secondly, and I think even more significantly, is the strength that swing states have.
States that are relatively purple and have a balance of republicans and democrats are viewed in much higher regard by people campaigning due to their likelihood to swing the election, and people will spend a lot more time engaging with those voters.
That's a problem because it means that people in reliably red or blue states simply aren't listened to in the same way that people in those swing states are, and as such their needs often go by the wayside when it comes to policy making.
Proud to propose."
"Technology is wonderful.
And if we're being honest, so is chocolate, bissli, a cold can of coke.
The problem is the combination of these in such extreme proportions, especially among children today.
Children are eating more and more junk food and they're spending more time in front of their television, computers, tablets and phones.
This means less time running around outside and less broccoli, and a lot more fat, a lot more clogged arteries, a lot more child diabetes and other health-related problems that we never used to see at such a young age.
It is for this reason that we believe physical education must be mandatory in schools, and we need a lot of it.
We think that physical education is no less important than learning history.
Schools are not just about learning learning from the past, it's not just about learning math, rather we expect our children to receive an education, a life education.
And when you are at such a young age, we think that it is essential that you get as much physical activity as possible for many reasons.
First of all, it is habit-forming.
The more often children have physical education, the more often they play sports, the more often they are let outside to play, the more often they're going to do so later on in life.
Why?
Because the more you do something when you're young, the more you're likely you are to do it when you're older.
The more that's the reason, for example, why we give homework in the first grade.
Why?
Because we think it's important that children learn how to sit down and do work, and once they get the hang of it at a young age, they're more likely to be able to do so at an older age.
And the same is true as for physical education.
The more likely the more we we we build in this habit at a young age, the more likely they are to continue doing sports, to enjoy doing sports, and to enjoy physical activity as part of their day-to-day life.
We think that moreover, we have a problem today with children not getting physical education outside of school.
Why is this the case?
For a number of reasons.
First of all, children are spending more time in school and in and in programs run by schools because parents are working longer and longer days.
It's also very easy for parents to sit their kids in front of a television, for example, or in front so that they can get more work done at home or so that they can cook dinner.
And these are options that didn't used to exist in the past and that do now.
Moreover, we have problems with safety at parks.
We think the parents are more and more afraid of taking their children to parks because they have to stand right next to them in order to make sure that nobody else comes up to them.
There cases of child abductions in the united states which scare parents from taking their children to the park, pedophiles, there too many concerns that that impede parents from taking their children outside to get physical activity.
We think that schools are a very safe place for children to get physical activity.
We think that they're safer than parks because they're supervised, they're enclosed, and you have age-appropriate activities that these children can be engaging in.
It also means that you get the benefits of team sports, for example, which which enhance social cohesion in schools, which encourages teamwork.
There are lots of benefits that are involved, that are very appropriate for a school situation, for teachers to be involved with, in order to make sure that it's really an educational experience and not just running around the schoolyard, but that there're benefits beyond the just the physical aspect.
We think that that's also important.
And, of course, we have the question of whether or not children should be allowed to make this choice on their own, there are children who might not enjoy it, but the fact is that children are not allowed to make these choices on their own.
We entrust parents to make most decisions for parents but parents for children, but parents entrust the government they to with their children when they send them to schools for between a hundred and eighty and three hundred days of the year , you know, between five hours and eight hours a day, these kids are spending in in in a schoolyard environment.
And we need to make sure that we take that seriously and we give them a full education that includes physical education, and that we take their physical situation and their health situation very seriously in these cases.
And that's why physical education must be mandatory."
"We should legalize organ trade.
So, what we mean by this is that, individual should be allowed to buy and sell organs on a regulated market.
Right now, if you need an organ, say, you need a kidney transplant, in most countries, like the US or britain, you get put on a list, and you get promoted up the list, as people ahead of you either you know receive a kidney, or pass away.
There's no way to advance yourself forward, there's no way to be sure that you get a particular kidney, and the rate at which people are advanced on the list is determined solely by the number of organ donors giving up a kidney, at a given time.
So, we're saying that you should be able to sweeten the pot a little bit, that individual should be allowed, regardless of their position on the waitlist, we're okay with keeping the wait list for organs that are, you know, given by the deceased, things like that, but for individuals on the wait list, you should be able to purchase an organ from a willing donor at a fixed price.
We're not going to have the like some mad max madness, we're going to have regulations in place, we'll be sure that people are consulting with doctors and attorneys at every step of the process, so that it's very fair and carefully monitored.
Three arguments for why this should be the case.
One: the market would solve supply problems.
Thousands of people in the US, about a thousand people a year in britain, die because they're on an organ waiting list.
They have no way to save their own lives, or those of a loved one, because the only way to advance on this list is for people ahead of you to receive treatment.
We think that, there are very few organs available relative to the number of people who need organs, because there's very little incentive to donate right now.
Basically, you just need to be like a good generous person in order to be incentivized to give up an organ.
But most people, realistically speaking, aren't going to give up a kidney, that they might need one day, out of a spirit of altruism.
We think that forty thousand dollars would probably change their mind.
We think that, on the free market you would likely see that the price of organs would be very very high, but that this would incentivize many more donors, so the overall supply would increase, because realize that, the free organs that exist right now don't go away.
Most of them are from people who die in motor accidents, and were organ donors, things like that.
So, that supply remains constant, you will only see an increase as more people who are healthy are willing to donate part of their liver, or donate a kidney.
We think therefore that, fewer people will die, obviously this is preferable to the status quo.
The second point we have to make is that, even if it's principally unfair that rich people are going to be able to get organs, and poor people are not, as a result of this, we think that it's wrong to let people die over a principle.
Recognized that, whether you're a millionaire or whether you're a million dollars in debt, ultimately you still have a right to life.
We think that it's wrong to force people to stay on a list, when there are organs available, in theory if there were an open market, that no one can claim, and then those people die.
We think that you need to allow people to do what is in their own interest, inasmuch as they're not harming anyone else.
We think that, if anything, as more wealthy people purchase organs on the private market, you would have fewer people competing for those donated organs, and ultimately this would help low income people too.
Indeed, it seems that a rising tide would lift all boats.
Our last argument is that, this is the only way to help people with certain rare conditions or genetics.
Recognize that, you can't just, you know, take any old organ and slap it in somebody, and then sow'em up and call it a day.
They need to have certain genes in common, they need to have the same blood type, all of these things.
What this means is that, if you have a rare gene, or a rare blood type, or if you are a minority ethnicity, then you're going to have a much harder time getting an organ, than some white american with o negative type blood and no special genes.
We think that, if these people could propose a bounty effectively, asking someone with the relevant genes to donate, that it would be much more likely that they would receive an organ.
In the status quo, they're effectively condemned to death.
So, because we think the market would increase the supply, because it's wrong to kill people for principle, and because it helps people with rare genetics, we should legalize the organ trade.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should adopt a direct democracy.
What we mean by this is that in the united states we would make it so that every major bill or like act of legislation would become a referenda by which individual people would get to vote off the internet and whatever the outcome of that vote for their options would become law.
We think this could apply both on a federal and a state level in that if there's like a particular piece of state legislature, than everyone in that state would vote directly and if it's a piece of federal legislature, then everybody in the country would have the option to vote correctly and like it trickles down in the same manner.
So if this is like a local piece of legislation for the region then we would say that everybody in that region or in that district or in that county would be able to vote on it.
Three main areas of clash, first on finding the most democratic system.
We value democracy for a few reasons.
First because in its ultimate interpretation it prevents oppression by allowing individuals to have a direct voice over the way in which their government acts against them or over the way in which the government acts period realistically.
Second because it provides a space for individuals to self actualize.
We think that in a democracy, people often act behind the veil of ignorance which they think about what they themselves would prefer not to be imposed upon them and then use that to become the framework for different laws.
And third because it minimizes government intervention.
We think the way in which people are allowed to maximally self actualize is when the government stays as much out of their business as possible.
The problem is that you can't truly achieve these impacts without a direct democracy because a representative democracy always leaves room for things like lobbying of special interest groups or the ignorant ignoring like a particular individual group because you know they don't have the finances to lobby you or make real change.
So, we think that it's easier to prevent a population from voting for a representative than it is to prevent a population from voting for every single order or act of legislation like we think it fundamentally changes the incentive structures of lobbyers so that now they have to convince the general populace that they are good and not just one individual representative.
We also think that the only way we properly represent everyone is through a direct democracy because at the end of the day it's just incredibly unlikely for minority groups to get adequately represented in a representative democracy.
Like we see this even with gender where eventhough we have like a fifty-fifty split in society there are like maybe four women to every maybe like four men to every one woman in politics but this especially gets worse as you move down to like racial minorities and things like that.
We also think that it used to be impossible to obtain a direct democracy due to like technological limitations but it's important to notice that this is no longer the case, we have things like computers that like can count these ballots and so insofar as we can achieve a better democracy we ought do so.
Our second area of clash is about combating apathy.
Currently people don't feel pressured to keep up on news or politics in part because they know that their representative will take care of it for them but also in part because they feel like there's a lack of control over policies since they know that lobbying and like general money plays a really large role in deciding what policies come into action.
But if they know that their votes have a direct impact on that policy becoming law, we think it creates an incentive to stay informed and it especially engages younger or poorer populations that have specifically become disenfranchised through the lack of control.
Our third area of clash is about increasing efficacy and decreasing corruption.
Recognize that it's harder to lobby an entire population rather than small amounts of representatives that can be convinced using monetary incentives like we think it's really difficult to pose a monetary incentive big enough for an entire country of people and we think that you therefore you avoid this bad impact when you vote directly.
It also avoids bureaucratic time wasters like decisions in the status quo are rarely bipartisan which leads to stalling but it's really hard to stall a body of people that will tell you what the majority opinion is.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"It would be difficult for most people around the world today to imagine living without electricity.
Lights, heat, washing machines, dryers, dishwashers, computers, phones, and that's just personal use.
That isn't even looking at it the large scale, such as manufacturing plants and other industries.
And the number of people with access to electricity is growing and that's great.
Except where does it come from?
And what is the cost we are paying for it today?
And what is the cost that we could be paying for it in the future?
That's what this motion is about.
What we think, ladies and gentlemen, on the side of the government, is that we should incentivize research production and use of wind power through subsidies and tax credits.
We're going to discuss three main aspects: first we wanna discuss the dependency that we have on fossil fuels, and the dangers that lie there in, we're gonna discuss the advantages of wind power and whether or not the government has a duty to invest in effective clean and and and effective in clean energy solutions.
So let's look at the first issue, which is the dependency that we have today on fossil fuels.
We think that there are three main dangers and risks involved here: first, we have the health risks to people.
There is pollution, that is growing amounts of pollution around the world from from from all the use of electricity that we have, and it is damaging our health ladies and gentlemen, that is the first and perhaps the most important, or at least the most selfish thing that we can think about and perhaps will spur us to change.
We also have the health risk involved with the collection of fossil fuels.
We think that when people have to deal with oil rigs for example, that's the kind of an industry that presents a very high risk to its workers.
And then of course with the environmental risks which is again the pollution, but here we have to look more towards the long term and what's happening to our environment, and what kind of world are we leaving to our children, right?
We see that wildlife is is being affected by pollution, we see the ozone layer is thinning, we see that global warming is a problem that we need to look to.
And then of course there's the issue of the dangers of dependency on the fossil fuels and why is it so dangerous that we're just depended on one specific type of fuel?
First of all, because we're dependent on countries that control these resources and we think that it's dangerous when your entire energy consumption relies on their prices and their willingness to sell.
We also think that it's dangerous to be dependent on a finite resource and that's why we need to look to something that is not finite.
That there won't, that won't end up just disappearing whether it's a hundred years from now or five hundred years from now or five thousand years from now, we still need to make sure that we can be that we we are independent and not dependent on a finite resource.
So let's look at wind power and what are the advantages of wind power.
We realize that it's not a magical solution, but it is a large part of a solution.
We think that it greatly complements other types of clean energy, and here's why it's so great: first of all, you can use it on both the small scale and large scale.
That means that you can have wind farms, you can have large tracts of land that are currently not being used for anything or being used for wildlife for for agricultural purposes, but can be shared with with wind farms, and we think that that that's great for for larger solutions, but we also think that we can encourage people to privately invest in wind technology.
We think that we can encourage people, where applicable, to to install for example small scale wind turbines in their houses in order to make it small scale as well and make sure that people are utilizing wind to as much as we can.
We think that offshore wind farms are an option and we think that that solves a lot of problems that we have today in terms of land and space and whether people wanna be living near them.
We think it's a safe technology and that's also an important thing to remember.
So does the government have a duty to invest in these clean technologies?
We think absolutely.
They must protect the health of their citizens, they must look out for the future and they must make sure that we are not dependent on a finite resource that is going to run out."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should adopt vegetarianism.
As a model we want to establish that this is a debate about whether or not it would be preferable for society to voluntarily accept this diet change.
We're not going to implement policies that would force people to become vegetarians, rather we just think that this is a preferable lifestyle choice for people to make on an individual level, but especially on a societal level in aggregation.
Our first independent point is animal rights.
So we think that animal rights stem from just sort of like a pain like a like a suffering slash like happiness perspective that if there is suffering in the world it is bad regardless of where that suffering comes from and we think that intelligence-based you know frameworks of whether or not something has rights are inherently elitist.
At that point then if it is important to respect animal rights, there is obviously a need to become vegetarian, insofar as vegetarianism one reduce eliminates the moral complicity in the suffering of animals of factory farming.
These are obviously pretty extreme forms of suffering.
Chickens that are kept in tight coops for example or cows that are given or really any livestock that isn't given sufficient space, but also the way in which they are systemically executed.
If you think life has any intrinsic value this is bad but also the ways in which the animals are killed are often brutal and gruesome.
At that point then we think that there is a moral imperative to reduce your complicity in it.
But secondly when you have a society of vegetarians you obviously eliminate the demand for this product in the first place and as a result there is a tangible change in whether or not it happens because nobody actually is buying the products that facilitate the suffering in the first place.
Our second independent point is environmental impacts.
We think first that livestock is an inefficient use of land and water that just growing produce is just a better way to use this because it you know demands less from the system.
That in turn means that there are less things contributing to droughts and other resource shortages but other that there is less also that there is less over farming of land that you you know don't deplete soil in the way that you do when you have it you know actually like just absolutely mutilated by livestock.
In that sense then you have a infrastructure for food that is more capable of sustaining large populations at affordable rates.
That's important for things like global hunger but it's also important at a local level for insuring that people's you know expenditures on foods food is lower.
Beyond this though, in terms of the local environment, we also think that there's a significant impact on global warming created by the agricultural industry.
Methane for example that's like common in just like general biological waste generated by livestock is a significant contributing factor to emission that drive global warming.
As such then we think it is important to mitigate the extent to which livestock are actually bred and born in which in turn then contributes to global warming.
Our third independent point is health of the individual.
So we think that just being a vegetarian is a healthier lifestyle.
Red meat in particular is you know there are plethora of studies demonstrating that red meat is carcinogenic.
We also think that you know this meat is often laden with fat and other you know harmful ingredients that just aren't particularly healthy.
And beyond just the individual benefits of being healthy, you know longer lifespan, happier lifestyle, you know the mental impacts of just being healthy there's also larger societal impacts for example decreased healthcare costs which actually have a ripple effect across all of society because no longer do you have a system that requires healthy individuals to subsidize comparatively less healthy individuals.
That in turn means a society that spends less on healthcare costs and more on other things that are presumably you know good uses of your money when you don't have to spend it on healthcare.
Also there's just less suffering now because less people are unhealthy and have to get healthcare in the first place for things like heart conditions.
Proud to propose."
"We should limit genetic testing.
We think first as an overview, we're not saying that we're going to ban genetic testing or anything like that but we think genetic testing of any type must be heavily monitored by appropriate government agencies and that any sort of new procedures or new processes for genetic testing would need to pass some sort of system of regulatory compliance and oversight before going into effect and these would obviously we're willing to take on the burden that these are going to be very strong levels of oversight.
Two arguments for you today.
The first is that we think genetic testing opens unresolved moral issues.
When someone is getting genetic testing for some sort of a disease or to get a particular type of treatment the genetic testing that is common provides way more information than someone may be looking for and we're going to give some examples.
First, there's some sort of propensity for disease that can be brought up in your genetic testing.
There are many there are many genetic patterns and correlations between one's genes and their likelihood to get a future disease or their likelihood to get some sort of ailment in the future but these are things that have dramatic impacts on one's life and one may not want to go in say, you're getting genetic testing done for a disease you currently have, for some sort of illness that you currently have, you're not looking to get that you're not going into that hoping to get back information that in ten, twenty years you might be at risk of XYZ diseases.
There's also in central ancestral data that can impact one as well for example: finding out that you're not a blood relation to your to your to the people that you held to believe you're blood family and additionally, there's data that impacts one's family as well.
So having this sort of information for one person may mean that you can make deductions about the information and the propensity for disease in a wide variety of other people who are not part of the genetic testing.
There's no parameters in the status quo for how care givers should respond in these instances and there's a large potential to come with severe emotional distress.
Until we have some sort of moral barometer and some sort of understanding of how we should answer these types of questions, there must be intense limitations on genetic testing in order to ensure that when it's done it's done in a way that we can have reasonable expectations of the moral outcomes.
Secondarily though, we think that there is a severe slippery slope to genetic engineering that comes with genetic testing.
Having more development of genetic testing will almost certainly increase the capacity for genetic engineering as we perfect tech to work with jeans and we understand our genetic code in a more complex way.
We think that genetic engineering will lead ultimately to horrible social impacts.
We think the biggest one of these is that when new technologies come on the rise, they are always available to the rich and the powerful first.
This means that those people will be able to afford implants and augmentations that make them and their offspring smarter, more athletic, have longer life spans.
There's a whole there's a whole variety of impacts and benefits that could be gained from having these types of from having genetic engineering.
But if this is only being afforded to a small sector of the population, most average people will see little to no positive impact from genetic engineering.
All that we think you get is that you massively entrench current social and wealth divides that exists in our society.
We can see that those tensions are already causing huge problems in our societies and this will only make it worse.
But finally, we think genetic engineering leads to us losing our innate humanity and losing what makes us human, losing that common tie to our ancestors and to each other, about being a part of the same species, about having that same genetic makeup.
We think that when you do this you split humanity farther and farther apart from itself and from each other within within our human relationships.
We think that genetic testing without limitations will certainly lead to genetic engineering and that cannot be allowed and for these reasons, we should limit genetic testing."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish three strikes laws.
Three main areas of clash: first on why they are ineffective.
First, three strikes laws don't stop violent crimes because they don't target the real reasons for those crimes.
Most violent crimes aren't premeditated.
They're done under the influence of alcohol, they're done in the heat of the moment for emotional reasons.
And even if they are premeditated the reason that they are done are often like emotional and irrational, so we don't think that it's actually like that you actually tackle this when you say like: "" because you've done this so often you have to be punished for longer. ""
It also doesn't deter any other crime because those crimes also aren't done for the reasons for reasons that would be affected by this kind of deterrence.
Often times people do these crimes because they think that they won't get caught.
And it also doesn't solve the circumstances that pushes people into the crime in the first place.
IE being in great poverty, living in areas with with a lot of gangs where it seems like crime is your only choice, none of this is actually solved.
And the fact that we can just sign everything off to like: "" hey, because we're so tough on crime people will be deterred "" actually ends up costing a lot of people their functional lives and prevents individuals from ever having a shot at true rehabilitation.
Second under this for why it's ineffective is that it causes a lot of court clog.
People are less likely to take plea bargains when it doesn't reduce their sentences, which means you're having a lot more overloaded public defenders having to argue for real cases.
These drawn out it also means that there's always an incentive to draw out your trial on the third offense because you know they are going to get signed away for life if you don't win it.
So we actually think that people are going to be drawing out things for a lot longer than they usually would.
We also think that you actually end up with more violent people.
If you're arresting a two time felon it means they have nothing to lose on the third time.
So they're much more likely to be violent and resist arrest and cause police and civilian loss of life.
So we think as long as you're not providing people with an option they're always going to act in a the more desperate fashion and in a way that is more dangerous and more bad for the system.
Our second arguments about why this is unjust.
Recognize it punishes people for actions that they aren't responsible for.
Like a lot of people and a lot of felons are pushed to recidivism because they're stuck in poverty through a combination of not being able to get a job post prison, because of the fact that they are now forever poisoned on their resume, and because they were left out of society for so long that it was hard for them to maintain marketable skills.
They're being punished because the system failed with them.
We also think that this meets the the criteria for cruel and unusual punishment.
Three strike punishments are vastly disproportionate to the crime.
Like insofar as I can get like punished on the third strike with life in prison for like taking some marijuana, and just because this is my third drug offense, regardless of what the size of that is, I'm still going to get punished.
This is cruel and that it is disproportionate and this both violates the constitution but it's also just unjust in the more ethereal sense.
Like we think individuals probably don't deserve to be punished for more than is due to them and like it's bad when they are.
Our third argument is about how it contributes to the overcrowding of prisons.
It puts people away for longer than they should be and this clogs up prisons, making conditions very bad because the resources are spread so thin.
Because their side of the house doesn't actually increase the prison budget or build more prisons, which means we're just shoving more prisoners into the pre-existing systems.
This this means there's going to be more violence when prisoners are too close to each other and there aren't enough guards to regulate them, but it also allows gangs to run rampant and increases recidivism rates when conditions in prison are so bad that you can't actually expect to be rehabilitated in any way and like might have to turn to crime.
We also just think this is really expensive.
Prices rise per prisoner when prisoners are older.
So that person that you have on the three strikes offense starting like twenty five, by the time that they're like eighty it is infinitely more expensive to care for them because they now have elevated healthcare costs, but they're also just not a risk to society anymore so it's unclear why they're still there.
-is a major money sink and ought be used elsewhere.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"I'm proud to support the motion that we should subsidize massive online courses.
So our first independent point is that education itself is a right and this insurers that we are going to essentially allow more people to access that right.
We think education is a right because it is facilitative to other more fundamental rights, three in particular: first is speech.
We think that your ability to speak freely on issues that you know matter to you and express your opinion requires you to have a baseline of information regarding the issue.
So, if I want to you know exercise my right to free speech on say taxes or something like that, I have to understand the topic pretty well in order to formulate an opinion that best reflects what you know is best for me and what represents my best interests.
We think that because that right to free speech is so fundamentally important in a democracy and just and society in general, it's important that people have access to the information necessary to formulate those opinions.
Secondly, is representation.
We think that in a democratic society especially, it's important to understand issues in order to be able to communicate your needs and desires to your elected representatives.
We think that fundamentally, a democracy cannot work unless there is a level of communication between the represented and the representers, and without access to information on the modern issues and ability to you know sort of contextualize that to determine what your needs and desires are you don't have a functioning democracy.
Education therefore is necessary to exercise in all of that.
And thirdly is access to money and sort of the opportunity to get higher employment, and then by extension the things that that buys.
So health care for example is a good example of why we need access to money, and we think that sort of higher paying jobs, and things that create a sustainable living are often impossible to get in a functioning society without any sort of like a proper education compared to the rest of your society.
At that point then we think that these large online classes, even if they don't have the rigor of say like harvard university, are still going to be much better than the status quo in ensuring that large amounts of people have access to some amount of education, and have the opportunity to receive that information that's necessary for them to secure their rights.
Our second independent point is that this creates a more competitive educational market.
So we think that a lot of the times, a lot of really basic things that would be easy to teach are still charged exorbitantly for at private and even public universities, on the basis that there isn't much else of a place to get them.
Like things like khan academy and what not exist, but these aren't as like open and like as large as sort of what we're going for here.
And usually they charge like some sort of subscription fee.
So we think then that it's important to create a market that is more competitive, by essentially saying: "" look, baseline stuff like econ one o one, you can get that for free through like the large government course. ""
At that point then we think that colleges are incentivized to essentially create a landscape where they more go in depth because they have to remain competitive with the free product that's now being offered.
That in turn creates an educational system that is of a higher quality.
Our third independent point is that that's a more effective use of subsidies for the government.
So we think that in the status quo a lot of where government subsidies for education go, go towards like public universities and things like that.
We think though that these are often arbitrary, because the people making decisions in the government don't understand the educational system and the complexities of a university or the complexities of the courses themselves, to understand whether or not what they're subsidizing is actually effective.
We think with these types of courses though - a, because they're so basic but b, because they're done on a sort of like online large scale basis, where there's lots of data and metrics readily available, it's easier for the government to measure whether or not they're actually doing a good job with what they're subsidizing.
But furthermore, we think that by subsidizing something that's broad open and accessible for lots of people, you have a more direct impact on the poorest people in society, and as such you're able to do more good with each individual dollar spent on those subsidies.
Proud to propose."
"Affirmative action brings more good than harm.
So in this debate we're going to say that obviously there are some benefits and some drawbacks to affirmative action, our burden is just to show you that the benefits outweigh those drawbacks.
So three big arguments for you about why affirmative action brings more good than harm: the first is about how affirmative action promotes equality.
Recognize that equality cannot only be equality of opportunity, it must also include equality of outcome.
Why is this true?
Society can tell itself that it has equality of opportunity but this seems tremendously difficult to measure.
We think that in a society where the equality of outcome is nonexistent, that clearly the equality of opportunity is only an illusion.
So, for instance, it's true that in the united states right now, in theory, african americans have an equal opportunity as white americans to go to schools like harvard and yale but we see that in practice, when african americans makeup thirteen percent of the population and two or three percent of elite schools that something has gone awry.
We think that in order to have true equality, where you actually see people able to succeed regardless of their race, creed, sex etcetera, you need to see people actually succeeding regardless of their race creed sex etcetera.
And that means that you need equality of outcome, which it seems that the only way to get this is through affirmative action because it's not happening right now in the status quo, due to bias or due to past entrenched failures in society.
Our second argument is about creating leaders from minority communities.
Recognize that if you want to empower groups that have been historically disempowered, be that women, be that a certain religious or ethnic group, you need to create leaders who can express the needs of those communities on a national scale without relying on a more dominant group like men or white people to speak on their behalf.
You need to give disempowered people a voice and the only way to do that is to create leaders for them.
But these leaders necessarily need education and they need opportunities to get into positions where people will hear their voice.
So that means that not only do they need to go to elite universities where they receive the kind of education that the leaders of other groups receive, so go into oxford or university of toronto or whatever the best school in your country is, but they also need to have the same kind of work opportunities and opportunities in government that other people have.
If there are no african americans in congress than there are no congressional leaders who care a lot about what african americans need and who understand their experience for instance.
So the affirmative action must extend beyond merely education into the workplace as well if you ever want to see groups able to empower themselves.
And our last argument is about the future of these groups.
So imagine you think affirmative action is a really bad thing and you don't want to see it in your country.
You should still support affirmative action in the short to medium term because it will remove the need for itself in the long term.
What do I mean?
If you create a norm of having congress be proportionate with the american public in terms of how many blacks or hispanics or women are in the congress, then we think it's very likely that people will get used to that and parties will get used to running candidates from these groups and in fifty years you won't need quotas or whatever system of affirmative action you use anymore because the system will be self sustaining.
In other words the affirmative action process will remove the need for itself.
If you create a society where minority groups or disempowered groups are able to advocate on their own behalf, we think that in the future they won't need majority groups to give them things like affirmative action to succeed, they'll be able to do it on their own.
So at the end of the day we see that affirmative action brings benefits to equality that it creates good leaders from minority groups and that it will remove the need for itself so it clearly brings more good than harm.
Thank you."
"We should discourage the use of hormonal contraception.
I just wanna be clear briefly what this debate is about.
So, hormonal contraception uses chemicals, like estrogen, that are human hormones, in order to trick the body so that people won't be able to get pregnant or won't have their period.
Obviously, this has been a huge factor in women's liberation in the last hundred years but we think, on our side, that today there are better alternatives and that there's no need to keep using these types of birth control, for reasons that we'll talk about later, but obviously we're fine with any non-hormonal birth control on our side of the debate.
So our first argument is that there are alternatives today that don't have harmful side effects like hormonal birth control.
Hormonal birth control often causes many serious physical and mental side effects.
On the mental side, many women experience severe mood shifts or depression and this can be a huge problem, especially for young women who aren't used to the effects that birth control will have on them when they first start taking it, but it also has many physical effects.
So many people might experience harmful changes to their body chemistry.
These can lead to things like acne and also to much more serious illnesses that I won't get into, including greater risk of cancer.
So we think that there are a lot of downsides to using this particular type of birth control.
Today, we have other methods such as copper implants, for instance, that are extremely effective and don't rely on changing your body's hormones.
So this might not be suitable for everybody.
There might be some people who need to take these hormonal birth controls for health reasons or because they don't want to have their period at all, but we think that for many women who just want to avoid pregnancy, there are now more effective measures, which I'll talk about in just a moment, which also don't have all of these side effects for one's mental and physical health, and we'd like to promote those types of birth control, even though hormonal contraception is the norm right now for many people.
Our the next thing that I'd like to talk about under this is about the effectiveness of different types of contraceptives.
We all know that condoms often don't work and this is one reason why so many people take hormonal contraceptives as a kind of fail safe, but actually they're not tremendously effective.
If everybody took the birth control pill exactly as directed, it would be ninety nine percent effective, but no one I know actually does that, and I'm not sure that there's anyone who does a completely perfect job when it comes to taking a birth control pill.
And this is by far the most common type of hormonal contraceptive.
The benefit of many of the alternatives that we've talked about, such as implants, is that they don't rely on a person doing anything day to day.
They just work, no matter what, until they eventually run out and you can just mark your calendar for five years down the line, or your doctor will remind you that you need to get it replaced.
Another great thing about this is that these implants can be removed if someone makes a change about what they want to do, and there's no long term effect in most instances.
So this really is a better choice for most women's health.
It's an enormous problem that we rely so much on this as the default type of birth control in our society.
I think that there's absolutely a place for hormonal contraceptives, but what we want to do on our side of the debate is move people away from relying on the pill as the go-to first line of defense when it comes to contraceptives and, instead, move towards considering a more personalized approach to every individual's health and also considering that there are just better technologies, that didn't exist in the sixties, that we have available to us today.
So on our side, what we've shown you is that there are many types of birth control that don't have the same side effects as hormonal contraceptives, that oftentimes these are really dangerous for young women to begin taking or for certain individuals and that, in the long term, we will have fewer unwanted pregnancies if you encourage people to switch over to other types of birth control rather than hormonal ones.
For all of these reasons, we should discourage the use of hormonal contraceptives.
Thank you."
"International recognition for abkhazia and south ossetia is justified.
So, in this debate, I want to be very clear: we're talking about what is principally justified, and not the best material outcomes.
I think that independence would be good for that as well, but it's not the primary focus of our debate today.
Two arguments: the first is that, the existing borders of georgia are unfair.
Recognize that, these are regions that want to secede from georgia, and have wanted to do so since nineteen ninety one, when the soviet union broke up.
When the boundaries of georgia, abkhazia, and south ossetia were drawn, back in the twentieth century, they were all part of one country, the soviet union.
So we see that, at that time it wasn't a tremendously important, whether these regions we're part of russia, or georgia, because they were all under the same government anyway.
What does this mean?
So, when the soviet union broke up, which I'd like to point out nobody voted on that, when the soviet union broke up, it's not like they had a vote in every single republic.
Instead, it was leaders of those republics, who were appointed under communism, not democratically, making the decision on people's behalf.
So, georgia leaves the soviet union.
It takes abkhazia and south ossetia with it.
The people in those regions never consented to being part of a sovereign georgia.
They, for decades, have been living under soviet rule, many of the people who live there are ethnically russian, and probably would have preferred to remain part of russia when the country broke up, rather than becoming part of georgia, where they're now an ethnic minority.
We don't think that, boundaries, that are drawn without the consent of people that live there, should be treated as legitimate.
Now, the other team could get up and say: look, very few boundaries are drawn with the consent of the people who live there.
Look at catalonia, wants to leave spain because those boundaries are illegitimate.
But, I think there's a big difference between boundaries that had been in place for hundreds of years, like in catalonia and spain, versus boundaries that have been in place for what?
Twenty five years at this point?
Ultimately we see that, this is a problem that would be very easy to solve, as opposed to pulling apart countries that have existed for hundreds of years.
The other point, that I'd like to make under this, is that look, if georgia gets to illegally secede from the soviet union, there was no legal precedent for that to happen, why can't abkhazia and south ossetia not do the same thing for georgia?
If the international community is willing to support countries like georgia, when they leave their country illegitimately, with no legal backing, then I think that we need to be consistent, and allow regions within that country to have the same degree of freedom.
The other side might get up here, and tell you: this sets a dangerous precedent for regions to leave a country that they don't like being part of.
But, given that the formation of georgia was an unconstitutional act, in and of itself, under soviet law, we think that we should look at that standard, rather than a standard for countries that were formed more legitimately.
At the end of the day, we think it would be just to recognize these countries, because it would be applying the same standard to them as to georgia.
We think that justice shouldn't be arbitrary, that we should hold everyone to the same standard, and in this instance, in georgia, that means letting these region secede of their own free will.
And our second argument is that, we think it would be also justified, because it would maximize freedom for people living in that region.
Recognize that, the reason why the people living in abkhazia and south ossetia want to leave georgia, is that they're ethnic minority who is not being treated very well by the government.
These people's freedom is being limited, and I think that it would be better if they were independent, or if they were part of russia.
We think, first, that individuals know what is in their own best interests, better than anyone else, that they can make a reasonable decision as adults living in those regions to say: we're not being treated well in georgia, we want to try something else instead.
That's the first thing.
The second thing is that, we think we should always preference maximizing individual freedom.
Governments, by their very nature, limit individual's ability to make decisions for themselves.
Were okay with that, because they reduce violence.
But, at the point where a state isn't reducing violence, as we see in georgia, ultimately we don't think that, we should force people to remain part of that state.
So, we think that you need to apply the same standards to everyone, and that we should preference freedom over anything else.
So, therefore international recognition for abkhazia and south ossetia is justified, thank you."
"We should abolish term limits.
So our main argument is going to be about the democratic will and why we think term limits are are antithetical to the entire purpose and constituency of democracy.
So, at the center of all democracy is the ability to select those who will represent your interests, the ability to have a say in what the governance is going to look like that in in your state, and who's going to be a part of that governance.
We think that term limits set an arbitrary amount of time as the maximum for how long someone can hold public office.
So it's not like there are certain reasons why, say, holding four terms is going to lead to more or less harm than holding five terms or anything like that.
We just arbitrarily draw a line when you have term limits and say, "" this means that you cannot run for office anymore "", and this de facto limits the will of the popular vote.
We think that this is principally unacceptable.
It creates an undemocratic check on the people's will without some sort of strong justification for removal at that point.
Yes, you can make arguments about why this is used to avoid tyranny, and we'll address those in the future, but all those arguments are not dependent on any one point in the future at which you draw the line for a term limit.
They're just theoretical limits theoretical ideas of what could happen over a long period of time generally, and so there's no rationale for specific term limits, and we think that these are principally unjust for silencing the people's voice.
So, there are also many reasons why long-term incumbent is good for people and why the people would want this.
First, that person likely understands the interests of the community on a deep level.
They've been hearing the vocalize concerns of community members for multiple terms now, and they have a long-time connection with individuals within that community.
So it's not just they understand their concerns, but they're invested in the well-being of their neighbors, with their fellow community members.
It's also possibly the case that a person who's been in politics for a long time as is a strong political operative who has experience in passing legislation, and this can include getting provisions into bills that explicitly help the constituents of that person's that that person represents.
There's also a track record of his of success that comes with an incumbent, and it makes voting for an incumbent a more secure vote than voting for someone who may replace him or her.
The reason for this is that when you've seen, time and again, that an incumbent, someone that has won multiple terms, has served the community well, has brought things back to the community they represent, whether it be funding for education, infrastructure, any of these types of things, they have a proven track record of getting things done and at the end of the day, that is the responsibility of the representative.
And if they do it well, whether it be for four years or for forty years, that person should be allowed to serve and represent the people.
So, let's let's address this "" avoid tyranny "" argument.
So the reason for term limits that is generally given is that if you don't have term limits, it allows people to accumulate too much power, and then they can just stay in office forever and use that power in a tyrannical way.
We think that tyranny is always defined in the eyes of the populace.
It's not some sort of set term that you can say is that you can point it out when you see it.
It's defined by those who are being represented.
If an incumbent becomes tyrannical, we still think there are other checks in the state to prevent total control.
If I'm one member of a legislature and I've been running a political operation in one district, in one state, in the united states, well, this isn't going to be this isn't going to be enough to allow me power to actually turn that state into a tyrannical state.
Even as the president, there are a number of checks and balances that prevent these things.
And finally, you can always still vote this person out.
If suddenly they stop representing the interests of the people, if they stop serving the role they are meant to do, the people have the ability to see that and to vote that person out, but it's not done in an arbitrary way like term limits set, it's when that person is removed from office because they no longer represent the voice of the people.
For these reasons, we should abolish term limits."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abandon feminism.
I think we're going to be talking specifically about the united states.
We also mean that you we're not saying that you ought abandon the fight for equality, we're just saying that we should abandon the brand of like the term feminism, like regroup the movement, maybe name it something different, and figure out kind of a different way to operate for numerous reasons as to why feminism in the status quo, the way that it is named makes it first a bad image, but secondly is very bad pragmatically.
As a first I want to talk about the branding issue that feminism currently has, because recognize that there is a massive social stigma around just the word feminism, around the idea of identifying as a feminist or not.
We think that conservatives have been able to spend years building a platform around the idea that the word feminist in itself is something that is coinciding with the idea of female supremacy over men, the idea of oppression of men, something that is like incredibly unfair.
It makes people who might believe in equality turn away from the overall movement because they don't want to be associated with that word.
Like we think a lot of people come from conservative backgrounds but have relatively liberal ideas regarding female equality, but because they grew up in these backgrounds that have been vilified the word to this extent, there's no way for them to ever identify with it or like be able to identify with it with that without facing massive amount of backlash.
And we think that the feminist movement has spent massive amounts of resources de-stigmatizing the word, rather than actually taking action and focusing on furthering the movement to try and meet its goals.
Like we see things like it hiring different actors and actresses to talk about how they are feminists, and why it's not about a word, and like campaigns like feminist not feminazi, and we think that if we were just able to stop explaining this to people over and over again, recognizing that they're unlikely to change their mind either way, and focus on actually being able to do the things that the feminist movement wants to accomplish, then we'd actually be freeing up a lot of money and a lot of time, and we'd also be able to actually be able to do things like gain allies and spread the population.
Because recognize that that's all that a movement really is is like the population that supports it, the amount of money that it's able to gain, and you just can't do that when a large portion of the population is turned off because of something like the name, before they even learn more about it.
We also think that it's really harmful because it's gained these stereotype of being exclusionary to women of color, ignoring intersectionality, ignoring the way that gender is fluid, things like that, which creates fracturing and prevents the movement from being truly representative when individuals don't want to associate with having this movement, not like maybe because they're conservative unnecessarily but because they see it as being like trans exclusionary, or too white.
And so we think this is like very legitimate reasons to not want to associate with the current feminist movement, but something that is easily solvable of the feminist movement no longer associates with the same movement.
This brings us to our second area of clash which is about corruption in the current movement.
Because recognize that the feminist movement as it currently stands is majorly run by rich white women, it's really ignorant of the intersection with race, transiness, class, queerness, etcetera.
And these are issues that are structural, which can only be solved by rebuilding those who are in charge of the movement, those that make the calls.
Like we think if we were able to have groups like the me too movement leader etcetera being able to be like making the priorities etcetera, this would instantly become a more representative movement that more people are willing to join and represent.
Like insofar as times have changed, we think that these movements needs to dramatically move with it, which only happens when you recognize that what works seventy eighty like a hundred years ago no longer works in the status quo, the people who we considered our equals at that time are are still our equals but we've added to their numbers now, and this isn't something that the feminist movement represents right now, but it needs to.
Proud to propose."
"We should introduce year round schooling.
We think that when it comes to education debates the focus of the debate should always be on what is most likely to result in good education for children, what is likely to lead to a more informed populace in the future, and what is most likely to be effective in actually achieving the goals of educating.
So the model for this we think is pretty clear.
We think that instead of having summer vacation, we would have school all for the entire year.
We think that you're likely to increase we would probably increase the amount of school days that people have but we would also increase the amount of breaks that exist during the school year.
So in the status quo in much of the united states there are like two large breaks during the school year.
One for the spring, and one for the winter.
We would increase these types of one week breaks but we would get rid of the three month layoff that exists during the summer.
Alright so why do we think that this is so crucial?
So the status quo has some very clear flaws.
When we're talking about education, when you're talking about allowing people to really internalize what they're being taught in a classroom, we think that a three month gap every single year between class ending and class beginning is one that is likely going to result in the deterioration of skill.
This is why in many schools the first month, or the first few weeks of class, result in people relearning what they learned in the past year.
For example if you're going from algebra to geometry in high school, the first month of geometry may be composed of relearning the things that you learned the year before in algebra and the reason for this is that teachers and students alike both know that people simply forget the things that they've learned the year before.
Once people pass the test and move on move move on with their life start, enjoying their summer, they're unlikely to actually remember the things that they learned in that class which means that school itself becomes a repetitive practice and it's also a massive time waste that otherwise could be used for teaching other subjects for continuing education.
But more importantly, we don't think there's any sort of consistency to this type of education in the status quo.
We think the way that people are most likely to learn to most likely internalize knowledge is to get a consistent learning pattern develop, to have some sort of study methods that they're able to consistently applied throughout the year but having hiatuses such as summer vacation, don't allow for these consistent patterns of education to emerge and we think that this leads to bad education habits and it leads to people always counting down to summer vacation.
When people always have this one long break to look forward to they tend to turn off especially in the latter half of the school year when they know it's coming close.
If you don't have these types of things we think you have more consistent patterns and what we've seen is success abroad where people have had these types of year round schooling.
In nations that do have this type of schooling, their test scores tend to be higher than the test scores in places like the united states and other areas in which they have this very long lay off in the middle of the summer and we think that we think that arguments that go against this often involve the idea of children wanting to be able to take the time off.
That there's this expectation that parents want to take their children on vacation and do this and that.
But recognized if you give breaks during the year these types of things can still be done.
Children can still get time to take their breaks but you actually also can spread the spread the lessons, spread the tasks out over a longer period of time which means that we think that students while they're in school, are less likely to have the same levels of stress, the same levels of anxiety, and the same pressure upon them as they would when the school year shortened and teachers are forced to cram entire entire courses into a shorter period of time into a shorter period of time and trying to get it all in before they lose the attention of their students who are always looking on to the prospect of summer.
We think that year round schooling has been shown in past instances to be successful.
It is shown to allow for better education patterns, and habits to form in students and we think that simply sticking to the old way of doing things because people are comfortable with it is never sufficient excuse.
We think that year round schooling is likely to result in more educated students, in a more educated populace, and for this reason, we should introduce year round schooling."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should adopt teacher tenure reform.
So a quick model.
Currently teacher tenure occurs after three years of observation it makes it very difficult to fire that teacher and it provides them with like with essentially what is supposed to be more free reign in the classroom.
So I think instead of these kinds of situation we would prefer to lengthen the probationary period of observation would make it easier to fire those with tenure and there'd be a better rating system and like regular job reviews regardless of your state of tenure.
Moreover what matters most in this round is obviously going to be the impact on the children because the purpose of school is to educate children and if you're not being successful or reaching your full potential in that task then you are clearly not meeting your stated goal and there needs to be some kind of reform.
Three main areas of clash.
First on why current tenure creates complacency among teachers.
Tenure makes it incredibly difficult to fire someone and if you're not going to have any kind of threat of losing your job or you don't or you feel overly secure in your job you no longer have an incentive to exert yourself more than you have to especially like people get very busy they start to have families and lives and at a certain point you're going to start sacrificing something.
On our side of the house we think that sacrifice cannot beat your job given that influences so many small lives that are still developing.
So we would prefer that teachers continue to have a professional reason to prove themselves and especially given that a lot of the time when you get tenure you are significantly older and you already occupy a position that potential younger and more enthusiastic teachers could fill.
So you think that you actually have to justify your position to a point and if you're making it so that kids get a sub par education because you are complacent no longer feel the need to prove yourself to the board that is to announce your tenure then you need to be out of there and someone who is willing to put in that effort needs to be begin.
Our second area of clash has to do with why tenure makes it very very unnecessarily difficult to remove incompetent teachers which hinders our school systems.
So tender guarantees a level of security and it's incredibly difficult to breach that level it's hard to prove that there's a reasonable reason to fire them after they're tenured and it also becomes incredibly expensive given that you have to now negotiate with teachers' unions you have to get yourself a lawyer you oftentimes have to like cobble your parents into a situation and it means that most schools don't even bother doing so because if your choice is between a lengthy lawsuit over one teacher versus spending that money to fund other school activities or to pad the pockets of your of your board then you're not going to choose that lengthy difficult lawsuit especially since it often comes with a lot of bad publicity for your school in the eyes of the media.
And you can be very easy to spin the school as a villain.
So once we recognize that it's ridiculously difficult to fire a current member like was tenured we then have to discuss how this can be fixed and we think that reducing that barrier a little bit and allowing it to become easier to fire teachers creates a world in which we can actually get rid of those who are no longer making our school systems better and we don't think that it's going to be over used because it's always going to be difficult to start initiating firing someone.
And there are a lot of protections that unions put in place regardless of tenure's existence and it's really difficult to get around those.
Our third area of clash has to do with how tenure makes seniority the main deciding point when dismissing teachers on hard times.
Especially recently we've seen that schools often find themselves economically strapped.
They have to make cuts.
The problem with tenure is that it changes the order in which we cut our teachers.
It basically says that those who have been around for longer and have tenure are going to be cut last.
This is incredibly problematic because those who need those jobs most and those who are likely to put the most effort in their jobs are actually people who are significantly younger and so we think that if we were able to switch this order it would be much better for children especially in situations in which your school is making a lot of cuts during economic hard times.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"We should subsidize women in science.
And it's very important we do so.
And for starters let's talk about what the problem is.
Women are obviously underrepresented in science right now.
Whether it's because of like historical injustices and historical barring of women from certain scientific careers, or societal pressures that push women away from like stem fields or more rigorous field, and higher paying fields, in favor of things that see were like traditionally seen as more becoming for their gender.
So for example instead of pushing women towards medical schools so they become doctors, society would push women toward becoming nurses.
And additionally women also have to face all other kinds of discrimination.
Whether it's work being discredited or not being looked at is highly because of their gender, like like their research not being taken as seriously, or sexual harassment and things like that that are rampant in all across society and certainly in the science as well.
This is why we clearly see a problem where women aren't as represented in sciences as they should be.
And I think that subsidies can do a very subsidies can be very helpful in solving this in the order of like making it more likely, for several reasons: so first it would it would help because financial incentives always speak incredibly loudly.
So when so when you incentivize something financially with a subsidy it's more likely that this is going to happen.
And then secondarily it also sends a signal that we are going to make, as an active priority, making sure there's more women in science.
So that's also a good way to get this goal and to also send a message to society to empower women.
There's a lot of women there's like a thing called the confidence gap, where a lot of women may like go into college, wanting to go into medical school, but end up deciding that are not cut out for it because they're constantly being like taken down by like male professors who don't take their work seriously, or things similar like that, which is something that I think you can help solve when you're making as an active priority pushing women into the sciences, so that we women feel more empowered and inspired.
And this is also going to have a like a snowball effect over time, because once more women go into the sciences it's going to become a more comfortable place for more women to go into sciences.
So now that we've talked about that, let's talk about why it's just good for society if women more women go into science.
And there's a lot of obvious things there.
So the first and, the first and big reason is that women are incredibly smart and women have a lot to offer in the ways of sciences.
And historically women have made all kinds of like achievements in a society.
Like women in science have had like a long history in science even though they've been suppressed oftentimes and they're not always getting the full credit they deserve, or sometimes even men take credit for the work that women do in the sciences.
It doesn't mean that they haven't been present.
And it's quite simple that when you have more intelligent people in any given field you're going to make it better.
You're gonna have women are going to be able to bring more ideas and more perspectives and more ability to better do research.
And that's gonna be great.
We're probably going to see more breakthroughs.
But it's also likely that the change of perspective can also make it so that there can be more of a focus on scientific research that can be to the betterment of people.
And I think that oftentimes people do scientific research to which it like maybe they find interesting which is why they go into a certain kind of field or something like that.
And I think that if you have more women in the in the sciences, you are also going to be able to better come up with scientific solutions and scientific understanding to the way in which it'll benefit women.
I also think that this would help with things like wage gaps, because sciences often tend to be incredibly higher paying careers and things like that.
But finally I also think this is just a right that women have.
Because in the same way that if a man chooses that he wants to be a scientist rather than a lawyer or any other kind of choice that he makes, that's generally something that we accept as a right.
You have a right to pick your career to a very great extent.
And and insofar as that women are being denied this choice because of historical and current biases in society, the government should do what it can to prevent this through subsidy.
So for all those reasons, subsidize women in science."
"We should limit natural resource exploitation because limiting natural resource exploitation will be both good for the environment and it's the moral and responsible thing to do in the long run.
So let's start by talking about why limiting natural resources is basically a necessity and there's like a lot of reasons for this.
First and most notably, a lot of these resources are finite.
It may like seem like when you're talking about like vast quantities of things, because like the earth is a pretty big place, so when you're talking about like something like oil or gas or even trees, you you in your mind are thinking of something that is basically endless, even like in the conventional sense like with some renewable resources.
But nothing is really can like basically like most of these things don't just like last forever.
You're going to run out of like rare earth metals eventually if you just keep using them endlessly.
You're going to run out of like fossil fuels and even some like renewable sources of energy.
So things like plants if you don't if you use them too much they will die out, and it could take like dozens or hundreds of years for some of these things to like rebuild themselves up.
So if you don't limit your natural resources uses, you might you might just run out of it in the first place and then you're not going to have it at all.
This is further more likely to be amplified when you talk about the fact that human consumption is only growing for a couple of reasons.
First, because humanity is only getting bigger.
There's like already what like seven billion eight billion people in the world.
That number keeps growing.
There's going to be like more and more billions of people as time moves on.
So you're just going to get like a higher base number of people.
But beyond that, people are also consuming more things.
Like western countries consume a whole lot of stuff.
Big countries like china and india are starting to consume more things.
So as like the world keeps developing, you're also going to see like not just like the raw numbers of consumption going up but consumption per individual person is also going to go up.
So you're probably gonna have a crisis of availability of a lot of resources.
So this like lack of availability comes with a lot of consequences.
The first consequence is that it's just not going to exist anymore.
So you're going to have like a really abrupt need to change.
So rather than like responsible long term planning and like needing to like use limited amounts of a resource over a long period of time, there may eventually come a time where it just like runs out and then you're fucked.
So like like an example of this theory could be something like like there is like a lot of like media hype around like cape town in south africa basically in a drought.
It could run out of like there might just there just might not be water in cape town anymore and they'd need to like ship the water out from elsewhere.
Now imagine like on a global scale, if you just run out of something like water because you've used up all of the world's fresh drinking water or even more like you just run out of oil, so now all of the cars that currently exist just aren't going to work cause we don't have oil anymore.
This is something that like is not entirely unreasonable and if we don't like limit our consumption and plan more responsible for the long term, this is going to happen and that's also going to like, besides just like have forcing like abrupt change you're not going to be ready for, it really is incredibly unfair to future generations who are going to have like a lot of like necessities deprived of them because of all of the irresponsible decisions that were made, hedonistic decisions that are being made in the present.
And this doesn't even get into all of the like realities of like responsible climate change and things like that in that you want to like try to curtail climate change, you want to make sure that the earth is actually livable in the long term.
So for all those reasons, we should limit natural resource exploitation."
"We should legalize organ trade.
We're going to implement a model that resembles surrogacy: both sides sit down and sign a legal, formal contract, with an agreed-upon price by both parties.
These entire procedures will obviously require that you go through medical counseling that both makes sure that the chances of the implant to actually succeed are high and that both parties understand the risks involved.
So all of this process is going to be professionally supervised by doctors.
Three arguments in this speech: why legalization is going to solve the problem of scarcity in organs and save many lives, why this is legitimate, why do we have a right to do this, and on black markets.
So first argument.
Right now we have a huge shortage the in organs.
The demand far outreaches the supply, and we are going to argue that this shortage is inherent.
The entire supply side rests on voluntary donations, both pre-mortem and post-mortem.
And now naturally, there's not a lot of incentive to donate organs pre-mortem unless it is in order to save like a close friend or a relative, so we don't get too much of these.
As for post-mortem, the only incentive for people to donate organs post-mortem is a moral one, and there's no actual, you know, physical incentive to donate organs and therefore, most people just don't do it.
They don't sign the the papers that say that they allow for organs to be taken from them post-mortem.
We say that money incentivizes people a lot more than a nice and cozy moral feeling.
We say that that is why we, for instance, need to make tax aversion a criminal offense and just and threaten to lock you up if you don't pay your taxes, because we just don't trust that you will pay taxes out of the kindness of your heart.
So, money is an incentive that does work, and as soon as we allow for trade, we create true incentives for people to donate more organs, which means that shortage, which means more people like less people dying in line for a an implant.
Now, we don't think that opposition can seriously oppose this, so let's move on to why this is legitimate.
Why do we have a right?
Opposition are going to say that we're screwing over the poorest of the poor that will feel almost coerced to sell their organs at cheap prices because they cannot rationally consider the long-term effects, because this is irreversible and so on and so on and therefore, we must ban this in order to protect the weaker parts of society.
So let's answer this one by one.
As for coercion, we say the choice is never binary, but always a spectrum.
Yes, some people can afford more choice than others, but it is unclear to us why this is wrongful coercion and choosing to work in manual labor in order to support yourself isn't.
As for like too cheap a price, two answers.
Firstly, we believe that once a market develops to these things, prices are going to be more or less homogeneous because I'm going to, you know, find out what's the maximum price that profit that I can make from donating a a kidney, and there's no reason for me to take any less because there's a lot of demand for it.
So I can always find someone that will pay the market price.
Secondly, there is no such a thing as a too low a price.
We have no way to assign absolute values of worth to an organ or to anything else for that matter.
And the best way to do that is the market value that is assigned through the natural laws of demand and supply.
As for rational considerations, we think that the fact that you are poor doesn't mean that you're stupid or less capable of understanding the long-term effects and in light of our mechanism, of course, that you will you will be like a doctor will sit you will take you through all of the long-term effects.
And as and about, you know, this process being irreversible, we think that a lot of the decisions that we take in life are irreversible.
A tattoo is irreversible.
We don't have any problem with that.
Lastly and very shortly on black markets.
So, we say that as long as we don't legalize it, that doesn't mean that we are able to stop organ trade.
Just like anywhere else where the where the demand outreaches the supply and the country puts limitations on trade, people turn to the black market where all of the harms that opposition side will talk about still occur and even a lot more than that, because there's no supervision and so on.
Very, very bad.
Please propose."
"We should absolutely increase gun control because first, guns are responsible for hordes of deaths, guns kill and they're incredibly bad.
Second, because guns are absolutely unnecessary, and third because you don't have any kind of right to a gun whatsoever, you shouldn't have any kind of right to a gun and guns are awful.
So first, why do I think that guns are just like incredibly bad for society?
I think that the data and the scientific studies on this like, and the research on this shows that guns clearly lead to more deaths in society when they're more widely available.
The reason why like a lot of violence is a lot less extreme in places that have stricter gun controls around the world is because when you have a lot of access to guns, first you're just obviously going to have more people who shouldn't have guns being able to find guns so this gives people who may be like unstable or this could lead to people who are just like bad people being more likely to get a gun, which means that they can just do more damage they can kill more people and that's going to be bad.
But I think that additionally, when there's more of a social acceptance of gun when there's more of a social norm of guns existing, and just more people in society have guns, you're going to be more likely seeing people be trigger happy.
So you're going to be seeing everyone from like police officers being more likely to shoot people because they're going to be worried about getting shot themselves.
There's all other kinds of factors that stem from a proliferation of guns in society.
It means that guns are just going to be more likely to be used because guns have more of an acceptance and that people have more of a fear of guns if they don't like use guns themselves.
These are like basic things that are reasons why there's so many documented gun deaths in places like the united states.
, but there's also like a lot of tragedies like like less are on the broad level and more on the more micro level.
There's a lot of specific tragedies or associated with guns as well and this is because on the like more like specific policy level, the way in which gun control like would work is that you can try try to regulate guns to some extent, but whenever someone like has a gun they're able to kill possibly a lot of people very quickly and it can be difficult to respond to that.
Because you can't watch everyone, you can't guard everywhere this is just, I mean that's impossible.
So it makes it so much easier.
When guns are around it makes it so much easier for people to do harm to other people.
But the next thing I wanna talk about is about why guns are just simply unnecessary.
So, like like there's two reasons why people think guns are important.
First because of sports and second because of self defense.
So first sport: I think sport is literally a ridiculous excuse.
If guns just like cause a lot of harm to people.
If they cause a whole lot of people to die in society then that's like a good enough reason to to like ban a sport.
That's like, This is ridiculous.
So, self defense: maybe a bit more legitimate, it's a shame that it doesn't actually have any kind of semblance of like coherent value whatsoever, and the first reason for that is because you're more likely to like hurt yourself if you have a gun for self defense, you're more likely going to use it in an accident when you should have, or maybe your child is going to use it as in an accident because they get into your gun, or your more likely to like shoot yourself with your gun or things like that, because you may not be able to use it properly, or someone else at your house, there's like a lot of data that shows that you're morally we're going to have like a gun being the source of an accident than actually save anyone.
But additionally I also think that like most guns you don't even need for self defense.
Like, a lot of guns that you can get, like hunting rifles or like to like likes or like sniper rifles, or like machine guns or even a semi automatic weapon, any of these kinds of guns that like have high capacity magazines that can kill people from far distances or or a lot of people in a concentrated area at once.
Like unless you're getting invaded by like a unless your home is getting invaded by a small army, you don't actually need these things for self defense.
So, there's also just like this over like hype like this is like this way overpowering of guns that are being allowed to be accessed by people so for all these reasons we should definitely increase gun control."
"Organ donation should be mandatory.
When there are thousands of people on waiting lists simply dying in hospital beds because they cannot get an organ, it is illogical that we do not make organ donation mandatory.
Simply put, forcing individuals to donate their organs upon death will save tens of thousands of lives, depoliticize the issue of organ donation, and simply put, increase the rights of all individuals who currently want organs and who will need organs in the future because their organs fail.
With this in mind, we would support the following model.
That all states with the resources to do so should force individuals to give their organs upon death.
It's unlikely that individuals will attempt to hide their organs or otherwise make it impossible for the state to get them.
So we won't need to punish dead individuals for not donating their organs.
We would say there'll probably be fines or other punishments for individuals who want to stop the government from getting organs after their family members die, but we don't think that will be a major issue.
With that in mind, two arguments.
First off is about rights.
We would say that individuals do not have a right to their body or honestly, any property upon death.
My opponents might come up and discuss the idea of inheritance.
That we allow individuals to allocate resources upon their death.
The only reason that we allow inheritance to exist is because of the utility of the issue.
We think that's more effective for people to decide and define what they where they want their resources to go so they'll continue to save their money in later life and continue to work for money as their life goes on.
This is a completely different issue with organs.
There's no incentive to destroy your organs upon death because that would simply be a greedy move that would be stigmatized by the whole of society and as such, there's no utility to be gained by allowing individual to have property rights upon their death over their organs.
At this point, we don't think there's any affirmative right your body.
Once you are no longer a moral actor and you do not have the ability to define those rights.
Similarly, we don't think this right would even belong to families.
Even if you think some individuals ought inherit these rights simply put, because family members cannot gain any true utility from using these organs effectively unlike things like property and money which would be effective for inheritance.
Another rights claim that's important in this debate is the idea of inequality.
In the status quo, poor individuals cannot get organs because they die on the waiting list.
If they can't pay for things like dialysis or expensive drugs they die because they can not get organs.
The idea of making organ donation mandatory will likely equilibrate the system and make it so poor individuals are likely to access organs because the list will be far shorter and far faster once you get on it.
Without any other analysis but the number of lives saved, we think that when rights are truly unequal based on money, the system is being oppressive.
We would say that solving impressive system by equilibrating it and allowing all individuals to benefit from it, is a moral good in and of itself.
Now my second argument is simply put that organ donation saves lives.
When you make organ donation mandatory the number of organs that hospitals and other organizations have increases massively.
As such, individuals are able to get an organ and save their lives.
We think that this means that individuals will live longer lives, more fruitful lives, be more efficient overall, making individuals happier.
Individuals who experience loss less often are less likely to feel depressed or otherwise unable to contribute to society meaningfully.
Additionally, we think that there'll be fewer stipulations on individuals who get organs.
We think that in the status quo, it is necessary to be incredibly selective.
People who get new lungs can't smoke at all, can't even be around smoky products.
Individuals with new livers can't drink at all even in moderation.
We would say that removing these massive restrictions on individuals, removing the ability for them to have autonomy is a good in and of itself.
Making organ donation mandatory and having a plethora of organs with which to give individuals will likely remove these policies and allow individuals to do what they want even after an organ donation.
As such, organ donation should be mandatory."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should ban child actors.
Three independent points.
First is that working in this industry at such a young age puts children at a very high risk for abuse.
We think that abuse can be a pretty broad term that applies to a lot of you know things that can happen to children but this can be anything from you know long hours and poor worker protections, all the way out to you know physical abuse and other ways of you know taking advantage of these children.
We think this is specifically true because there's a power imbalance between the child and the employer in such a way that makes you know reporting this abuse, whether it be you know personal or labor related, very difficult.
You know this is someone often that the child looks up to as an authority figure and this is also someone that usually has a strong working relationship with their parents because that's often how these child actors become you know decided upon as to who's going to be in the film or television show.
Given that, we think it's you know justified to institute a ban at the point where it is you know difficult to have proper oversight of these you know worker employee relationships and there's a high likelihood that you know something could happen that we wouldn't have a regulatory capacity to control.
Our second independent point is that the child doesn't have an ability to meaningfully consent into this work.
So I think when we think of labor generally, like the reason that we're okay with you know people doing something that is compelled by another person is because you agreed to it and you get like you know goods and services and in exchange you get money.
I think the problem with this contract being applied to children is that it's reliance on a certain level of information being exchanged between the employer and the employee that really can't happen with a child.
Obviously what generally happens is that the parent acts as a proxy for the will of the child but I think this logic that is that the parent has to make decisions for the child really only makes sense and decisions where you know you're going to have an outcome that definitely benefits the child.
Something like the parent for example agreeing to you know give the child vaccinations or something like that.
The parent can pretty reliably act as a proxy for what the best interests of the kid are but this is a very complex decision.
You know whether or not you're going to you know work long grueling hours on a TV or film set.
And I don't think that's a decision then that the parent really understands what the best interests of the child are offhand so at that point I think it's much more reasonable to just institute a ban on child labor in this instance and just wait until they're older to see if they want to pursue a career in this.
Our third independent point is that this particular line of work puts a lot of undue stress and pressure on children.
Working in you know the film industry is something that for one opens up individuals to a lot of media scrutiny, but it also opens them up to a lot of you know pressure in terms of you know long work hours, often demanding directors and producers, this is a line of work that really, really puts you through the ringer.
Even adults have trouble keeping up with you know the stress that's intrinsic to it and I think that that stress then and that pressure that's placed on children at such a young age when they're child actors has really profound impacts on them later in life.
I think you can see this pretty thoroughly with the lot of people that were child actors and grew up and now have you know somewhat bizarre adulthoods that are based on the lack of a childhood they originally had.
There's a reason that we you know have children go through very structured environments like school when they're young and it's because that structure and that you know that that strong support system that just doesn't exist on a film set is something that's really important to their you know development.
Proud to propose."
"We should cancel the affordable care act.
So this is a fairly large act.
So we're going to be clear about what we mean by cancel the affordable care act.
There are two main things that need to be done.
First, ending the public exchanges and the public market places that were created by the affordable care act and secondly, reducing the odious regulations, the literally hundreds of regulations put in place on the on the the industries impacted by the affordable care act and insuring that insurance industries are able to facilitate a free and open market.
Okay two reasons why the ACA needs to be canceled.
The first is because this is a massive government overreach and the government just shouldn't be involved in insurance to begin with and the second is that these marketplaces and these systems are collapsing.
Alright, so on the government we would say that the government is by its nature massively coercive.
Because the government has the ability to to yield immense coercive power, the course of apparatus of the state and the use of force, the only legitimate use of force within the state's borders with very little mechanism for consent.
Yes there are proxies such as voting, but we don't give that consent is very strong compared to the massive regulatory capacities the government is capable of exerting.
Because of this, the priority of the government should be to maximize liberty and to maximize personal freedoms.
This is a world in which people are able to flourish at their utmost capacity in a world in which most people would consent to such a state if they could.
The ACA inhibits this goal in a number of ways.
First it goes extensively beyond what the constitution itself it's the constitution itself says.
There's nothing about insurance.
There's nothing about healthcare regulation.
There's nothing about these marketplaces and it violates the explicit rules set by the state itself.
Yes, there's a supreme court ruling that was placed on this but we don't think that that supreme court ruling is binding especially given that the decision was five four and that four of the best legal scholars in the world at least constitutional scholars believe that it was unconstitutional.
Secondly, it forces individuals to pay for insurance.
It robs them of their hard earned money and it takes important life decisions out of their hands and out of their discretion.
Which is another way in which the liberty is stolen from people in these instances and finally, businesses are forced into hefty regulations.
It makes the product more expensive for people.
It makes those markets less free.
It inhibits what insurance industries and insurance agencies are able to offer and it takes away potential revenue and potential jobs within this industry.
All of these are ways that it may sound petty to say oh these large multi-million dollar industries shouldn't have to face these regulations, but we think that a just state is one in which the free market is able to act and people are able to choose whatever type of insurance they want to choose or no insurance at all.
This makes that impossible.
We think that this is an incredible overreach by what the government was created to do and because of that principally, should not be allowed to happen but on top of that, the ACA is failing in a number of ways.
Obamacare as a system just is not working.
The marketplaces are drying up and there are few providers in many regions but people are still required to pay for insurance or pay fines that come with not having insurance even when these marketplaces only have maybe one insurer for an entire region.
The costs of medical care are also going up both co-pay costs and deductible costs are going up which means at the same time as you're forcing people to have insurance you're also forcing people who would have had insurance anyway to pay more and more and there's also a potential for a death spiral because of these regulations that could wipe out even the thriving parts of the insurance marketplace because so many people are being forced to take insurance and these insurance agencies are being forced to take on people that they cannot afford to insure.
All of this means that at the end of the day, insurance quality for everyone has declined.
Individual freedom and personal choice has declined for everyone and the ACA continues to be an over-reach of what the government was created to do.
For these reasons, we should cancel the affordable care act."
"The motion for today's debate is that national service in the united states should be mandatory.
We'll model this in part off of israel and in part off of existing legislature in the united states.
What we mean is that everyone coming out of high school will be administered a skills test that determines what section in the military they will serve in for the next two years.
Then after military service is complete, any higher education that these people choose to pursue will be partially subsidized by the government.
Two main areas of clash, the first on social good.
We think that forcing everyone to serve in the military necessarily equalizes the playing field to an extent.
Sure we'll never get rid of certain people coming from richer backgrounds or being whiter than those who are surrounding them.
But we do get rid of where their privilege takes them.
Insofar as everyone joining the military has to start from the same baseline and work the same amount in order to get further, we think it necessarily allows people to succeed more than to succeed at the same rate as those who might be more privileged than them.
But more than this we think that it's an easy way in which young people get good job experience, earn some money before they move on to the rest of their lives and build strong networking relationships that can help them find jobs in the future.
Because we think that it's just true that young people often don't know what they're doing once they get out of high school.
Sure, we go to college because it's expected of us or we go work our first job because that's what we're told to do.
But in the end, those first two years are usually spent flailing around, taking random classes that aren't applicable to what we actually want because we haven't figured that out until at least year three.
We think that two years serving in the military provides a good basis with which to contextualize our lives, explore our options and figure out what it is we want.
We think learning important skills such as working with computers, working with other people, is important to allow us to be good, socially functioning and technologically functioning people in the future.
We think oftentimes what happens is that people learn a lot of theory in college but don't really learn how to apply it and we think that providing a basis where you already know how to operate in the real world is positive.
More than this though we think that veterans rights are much more actualized in our world.
Insofar as in the status quo there is a problem where PTSD is laughed upon and good and in good health care isn't provided to veterans out of coming after coming out of the military.
We think we solve that because when everyone is coming out of the same system they are much more likely to value and politically advocate for what their future rights are going to be.
We think that it's much more likely that the government will provide things like therapy and more economic help after after veterans come out of the military but more than this that you decrease social stigma on things like PTSD.
Our secondary of clash has to do with government and national security good.
Because we think it's just true that the draft is easier when people are already trained, in so far as people are already going to be prepared for the expectations ahead of them, know what their strong suits are and know what section they have to serve in, we think that you're always going to be more securely prepared on our side of the house.
But we also think that this increases political participation.
We think the problem in the status quo is that I'm more apathetic about my future because I first think I have no control over it, but second, I'm not expected to politically participate as part of my life.
We think when you force people to participate in the system, especially through something like military service, they are much more likely to politically participate in other spheres.
If I know that me or my children are likely to serve in the war that we're currently fighting, I'm much more likely to examine why we're fighting that war in the first place.
I'm much more likely to keep up with the news to see what the new conflicts look like.
And I'm much more likely to be personally invested in our political system when I know that it personally affects me.
We think in the status quo it's easy to distance yourself.
But now when it's personal, it's a hell of a lot harder.
Finally we want to talk about nationalism.
Because we think that a national identity is much more easily formed when people are aggregated into groups and forced to serve the same national entity.
If I have to fight for my country I'm probably going to believe in it a lot more.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"We should cancel the national flood insurance program.
The national flood insurance program is sort of a deviant portion of our law.
It really doesn't make sense given the total amount of protections that we provide to other victims of natural disaster.
Providing a unique system of flood insurance where communities can either opt in or opt out, largely means that people are harmed due to the actions of their neighbors.
It creates a nationalistic market, one in which the government steps in and pushes other private competitors out while not extending that protection to all people.
We think the best services are usually national, as I'll discuss later, and ultimately, the national flood insurance program does little more than harm people who would be hit by floods, while also treating people who are not in flood areas unfairly.
Three arguments for why we should cancel the national flood insurance program: first, on the market effects.
We think that when government steps in to particular industries, in this case the insurance industry, they push out their private competition.
There's very little incentive for large corporations to provide flood insurance because in areas where they might actually have to pay out or can actually charge a real amount of money if due to risk, the government will already be there.
They'll push them out and as a result, it's unfair or just simply unprofitable to have a number of adjusters, a number of claim evaluators, who evaluate whether or not someone deserves money due to flood insurance protection.
This is problematic because the national flood insurance program only extends to people where the community as a whole has voted on this sort of program.
The politicians must agree to it, the community must agree to it.
Otherwise, the government does not step in and provide it to anyone in the area.
As such, most places that are have propensity to flood do have this sort of protection, but in areas where the protection does not exist, we largely see no viable options for these people, as national programs don't have flood insurance programs, and local insurance companies do not have a mass amount of money and the upfront capital to pay out in the case of a massive flood.
Additionally, we think when government steps in and tries to alter particular industries, it's not very effective, because the government is run by bureaucrats with very little interest in the profits made by the company.
If the national flood insurance program makes a lot of money, that money doesn't go to politicians.
As such, it's likely to to suffer under mismanagement and uninspired labor compared to private industry which will be innovative, which will try its best to make a profit, and will largely protect people far more effectively.
My second argument is that it's undemocratic.
As I've already stated before, it's either that people in individual areas are unprotected or people in areas where they wouldn't want flood insurance are forced to buy it, are forced to pay for it through their tax dollars due to the votes of other individuals.
We think that stealing people's labor in this way is largely unfair, and unless there's going to be a universal application of a policy or an individual application of this policy, it's largely unfair to take away the right to speech and articulation of one's views from certain people while, at the same time, charging them money.
My third and final argument is that this is unfair.
People should only have to pay for goods where they get some sort of benefit from it.
Even people who don't have children should have to pay for school given that an educated population is effective for them to actually be able to empower themselves.
It's fair that people pay for things like fema, because having a whole section of the country unable to produce anything is bad for the economy and bad for governance.
However, insuring small communities from floods, insuring a few houses from floods, doesn't actually help most people.
The fact that my tax dollars go to this program and I have no capacity to actually benefit from this program is horribly unfair.
Additionally, it's unfair that we don't have this sort of protection for things like earthquakes, wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes, and we only provide it for floods.
Ultimately, canceling the national flood insurance program would be far more fair, far more democratic, and improve the market considerably."
"Patriotism does more harm than good.
So by patriotism we mean the love of one's country and the belief that it may be the best country in the world.
Similar things like that.
We see patrias-tism as a phenomenon throughout the world today and throughout history in places like rome, nazi germany and the united states.
And some of these places probably had better and worse outcomes than in others, but we do see that it has occurred in very diverse places with very diverse outcomes.
So we acknowledge that while patriotism may sometimes be good and encourage us to do things like put a man on the moon, it can also be bad and encourage us to invade france, say.
With that in mind we think that we're going to win this round on the comparative by explaining that the harm outweighs the good.
Two arguments: the first is that patriotism is an exclusive narrative.
By its very nature it authorizes anyone who is from outside of your country because the assertion that our country is the best means every other country is not the best.
They're worse than us.
We think that this makes it very difficult for people to relate to foreigners.
When you promote superiority we think that people lose sympathy because they think other people who have problems should just be more like us.
They're less willing to be sympathetic and think about the problems they have and how they're similar to other people and instead more keen to blame them for things that might not be their fault.
This is likely to build resentment.
Particularly in multi ethnic countries.
In a country like the united states, for instance, where tens and tens of millions of people were born in another country, telling them that the united states is the best country in the world and superior to their home is likely to breed resentment.
So we think that it's likely that you will get less integration of immigrants because of patriotism, and on top of that, the people around the world will resent this narrative.
If a country tells its citizens that they are better than the citizens of other nations that seems like a relatively poor way to make friends and a good way to have other people dislike you.
So at the end of the day we think that this exclusive narrative is likely to lead to conflict within and without a country.
Within a country it's likely to lead to conflict between different ethnic groups or people who have connections to other countries, and externally we think it's likely to lead to conflict with other countries because you're less likely to be sympathetic to their citizens, more likely to be willing to go to war with them, and because other countries will be more likely to seek out conflict with you, because they resent the narratives that you promote about themselves and yourself.
At this point I think it's clear that patriotism does more harm than good.
Even if patriotism gives something to feel proud of, even if it brings people together within a country, the divisiveness that it calls externally ultimately is going to outweigh that benefit and the risk of conflict is always going to outweigh a slight increase in national unity.
So our second point is that patriotism is a fundamentally false narrative.
We tell you that no country in the world is the best country, no country in the world is uniquely superior to all others, even if every country is probably really good at one thing or a few things.
We think that patriotism encourages people to overlook the shortcomings in their home country.
If you believe that you're the best country in the world you're probably more willing to accept things that are actually unacceptable.
For instance, if your government chooses not to invest in infrastructure, while telling you that this is the best damn country in the world and you should be proud of it, then you're less likely to demand that they invest in that infrastructure because you're already the best.
We think that this leads to an environment of limited criticism.
Anyone who attacks legitimate problems in the state is likely to be seen as unpatriotic.
This will lead to a backlash from other citizens.
Perhaps it'll jeopardize their status in the workplace, perhaps it could even lead to violence against them as some sort of fifth columnist or traitor.
We think at this patriotism also gives people unrealistic expectations for their country.
They might rush into wars expecting to win very quickly when actually they're unable to do so.
That certainly happened throughout history.
Or they might expect that certain outcomes of policies will occur even if their government isn't spending money or resources in a way that would make those a likely outcome.
We think this is a huge tool for leaders to abuse their people because they can use patriotism to avoid solving problems and they can use it to stir up trouble, to create resentment against other countries, etcetera, and ultimately channels people's attention away from legitimate problems in their own country to external boogie men by using the sort of proto-jingoistic narrative in the form of patriotism.
For these reasons we think that patriotism does more harm than good."
"We should further exploit wind turbines.
When we say that we're going to further exploit wind turbines, we mean that we think that the government should subsidize the production of wind turbines through private companies and that as a population, as a nation, we should seek to further use wind turbines for our production of energy.
Two big reasons.
The first and most important is that global warming is coming and we need to quickly shift to green technology such as wind turbines.
Global warming is likely the biggest threat that humanity will face in the next one hundred years of its existence.
It could be a fundamental turning point and how human beings exist and it could cost the lives and likely will cost the lives if left unchecked of millions and millions of people.
Let's look at some of the biggest impacts of global warming.
First, global warming is going to lead to rising sea levels that are going to destroy economic hubs and cities.
The big problem is that most of our major economic centers on the globe, think of most major trade cities, these all exist on the ocean because those are those have always been the cities that had been the best for resource trading, for exchange and for trade.
We think that when you have rising sea levels, it ultimately is going to lead to the death of many people but also it's going to cost millions and possibly billions of dollars in economic damage to these regions when people have to shift further inland and these cities that have been our hubs need to be abandoned.
There's also going to be more extreme weather events and we've seen over the last ten years in increase in events such as hurricanes and typhoons and tsunamis.
These things are only going to get both more populous so there's going to be more and more of these things but they're also going to be more destructive because as ocean water warms it means that the storms that get created from that ocean water ultimate ultimately end up being more powerful, they last longer, they're more sustained over land, and that causes the destruction that we've seen especially let's just look in the last few months in places like puerto rico places like georgia places like louisiana and houston and places like haiti.
And finally, global warming is going to lead to a lack of food and clean water.
The reason for this is that as global warning occurs, seasons begin to change which makes growing periods more and more irregular and leads to smaller food yields.
But additionally, when the wolrd when the world continues to warm, it means that our fresh water resources are more likely to evaporate and ultimately end up in the ocean meaning that we're going to have less clean water available.
And we're rapidly approaching the tipping point of no return.
We need to make a change immediately if we're going to stave off the worst impacts of global warming.
We can't wait ten years, we can't wait five years.
We need to make shifts dramatically away from fossil fuels if we're going to if we're going to ensure not only our survival but the survival of future populations and our children who never opted into this situation, who did nothing to earn this situation.
Not only is wind not only are wind turbines beneficial because they provide green energy but they also provide green energy in an efficient way that doesn't have some of the trade offs like nuclear energy which causes you know obviously nuclear waste or hydrothermal energy in the sense that wind energy and wind turbines can be used in vastly more places than hydrothermal can.
But even if you don't care about global warming, we think that wind turbines are just economically good.
First, wind turbines are a growing industry and they have even more room for growth.
Unlike fossil fuel industries that have already been spread out are drilling drilling missions already vast there's so much more resources that can be put into wind turbines and there's so much more economic gain that can come from them.
And the jobs are also fairly high paying because they require specialization.
They're not just jobs that any replacement worker could do and once these wind turbines are constructed there's less input costs than fossil fuels which means you get a lower cost of energy per kilowatt produced which means not only do you have cleaner energy that is good for the environment and good for humanity, but it's also cheaper energy which is good economicly.
For these reasons, we should further exploit wind turbines."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish the monarchy.
By monarchy we mean any monarchy in the world, so including the british monarchy but also not limited to that.
So the saudi arabian monarchy we would also replace a democracy.
Two main areas of clash, the first on why democracy is good.
First we want to explain why the only just government is one in which there is some sort of agreement between the people and the government that allow for people to elect their representation.
This is because in order to justify taking away someone's rights, which is exactly what a government does when it limits a person's mobility by borders, when it takes parts of their paychecks away through taxes, they must consent to it.
But this never occurs in a monarchy because people never get the ability to say, you are who I want to be my leader, rather whoever becomes the next leader of the nation is whoever is next in line for the monarchy usually by blood.
But even if you don't buy the principle, we think that there is a pragmatic benefit to having a democracy.
We think that when you have a more stable or that that a more stable and less violent society occurs when people feel engaged and represented by their democracy.
This is because if I feel like my government is doing what I want them to do, or if I feel like I had a say in that government, I'm much less likely to feel like I have to fight against it.
More than this though, we think that even if people are discontent in a democracy with their representation, they are much less likely to use violent tactics then in a situation where people are discontent with their monarchy.
This is because in a democracy you feel like there are avenues by which you can reach out to the people you elected by virtue of the fact that you had a say in their election in the first place.
So maybe I am unhappy with my current government, but I don't feel trapped because I know that I'll be able to vote for a new one or I'll be able to write an email.
As such in democracies, people are much more likely to opt for for peaceful protests than in than in monarchies where, because people feel trapped and never get a say in who the new leader is, they're much more likely to use violent tactics to fight back and show their discontent.
Our secondary of clash has to do with how the corrupt systems of monarchies cycle.
First, recognize that monarchies encourage collaboration between the king and whoever the upper classes are.
This happens because if in situations where you where kings want to maintain power, which happens essentially always given that power given that the desire to maintain power corrupts and people tend to like to keep fancy clothing or fancy like residences, kings like palaces and if they're no longer kings they don't get to keep them.
Or even if they're mobilized by noble causes so they think they'd be the best for them, the best way to keep that power is by insuring that you have strong allies and given that people with a lot of money have the most power in society, they oftentimes opt for that.
This essentially oppresses those of the lower class though because now it becomes the economic incentive of the upper class to maintain their money which means they can't allow it to trickle down to lower classes because it would mean losing some of that.
But even if but even if you even if you don't buy that and think that the majority of monarchies are made up of by noble kings and just kings who are not going to corrupt themselves, the problem is that you can never predict who the future is going to be.
Without a system in place to transfer power democratically you're still going to have situations in which maybe this king was a nice guy but you don't know what their son is going to be and more than that, you don't know what the son after that is going to be.
So at the point that this system essentially, even if it begins noble, oftentimes leaks into corruption, we think you ought defer to a system that puts a stop in a block in place and says let's revamp this every few years, let's have a democracy.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"The vow of celibacy should be abandoned.
What we mean by this is that the current catholic doctrine doctrine that exists in other forms of christianity but mostly in catholicism, that requires that priests and other religious leaders in the in the congregation are not allowed to do things like get married, they're not allowed to father children, they can never have sex.
This is the vow that they take on when they take on the role in the church.
We think that that shouldn't be a restriction placed on them but rather they should be treated just as any other congregation goer, and the moral code that applies to other people in their congregation should apply to them as well.
We have a few reasons for this.
The first is that we think it's simply unfair and the second is that we think that there is no theological reason, there's no theological grounding, for such a vow.
What we would say is that priests are only human.
They create companionship and intimacy just like any other person in their congregation would.
Simply because someone takes on the role of priesthood doesn't mean that they are embodied with divine nature.
It doesn't mean that they're capable of doing the divine, rather they are human that have chosen to take on the job and take on the task of being the relayer between their congregation and god.
As such, we don't think that there's any sort of special capability that these people have and we don't think that the ability to interact or the ability to have some sort of companionship in one's life dilutes one's ability from being able to from being able to converse with god or be able to relate it god in the way that a priest needs to be.
We can that as messengers for god they are not divine in and of themselves, and shouldn't be placed with restrictions that are only capable of the divine to carry out.
We also think that there are other ways in which the restrictions of the vow of celibacy can be can remain in place and that they are legitimate.
For example the moral code of catholicism that you can have sex before marriage we think that that is clearly an acceptable code to place a priest because this is the code that god has said is necessary and is requisite for all god fearing catholic individuals on earth.
As such obviously this would still apply to priests but we don't think that going beyond that and saying one can never have sex, one can never be married, one can never have a family, that they must be totally devoted to god and nothing else we don't think that that's fair to place to place upon priests.
We think the legitimacy of the vow is also massively undermined by things such as the the pedophile epidemic that exists in the catholic church.
We think that given that the appearance of the catholic church is one that has been massively ruined by the scandals that have rocked the church for the last several decades, we think that the vow of celibacy is outdated, and possibly allowing people to have families, to have relationships, to have that intimacy, may possibly cut down on those types of scandals in the future.
We also think there's no theological grounding for this type of vow.
Multiple text talk about how jesus may have had a wife, may have had a child, and some and given that this is the case, given that the most divine person within the catholic faith may have done these types of things, may have had the kind of human connections we don't think that it's obviously something that's fair to place upon priests which are not divine in the same way that jesus was.
Given that this is the case, we don't think that there's any sort of theological legitimacy for placing this restriction rather this restriction is one that's based on tradition.
It's based on ensuring that people follow what's been done in the past and we think that simply blindly following tradition in this nature isn't going to do things that allow these priests to have more of a connection with god.
It isn't going to do anything to attract more people to come into the faith, to attract more people to come to the church.
We think that religion needs to be obviously cognizant of its traditions but when they're not theologically based, when they're not textually based, we think that when there are clear harms such as unfair and divine restrictions placed on priest that these should be abandoned and for these reasons, the vow of celibacy should be abandoned."
"Open primaries in the united states are advantageous.
Generally, when we're talking about open primaries, we're talking about systems or states in which people may choose no matter their political affiliation which of the two primaries whether it be the republican or democratic primary that they're going to participate in which one they're going to vote in.
Normally you're not able to vote in both elections so you do have to make a choice, but your voter registration doesn't dictate that choice for you prior to knowing what those candidates are.
So that's the main distinction between closed and open primaries in the status quo.
We're going to say that these are advantageous especially in a comparative sense to closed primaries.
So firstly, we think that open primaries are more democratic.
The reality of the american political system is that the only possible outcome in most elections whether they be federal, state, or local level, is between the two party candidates.
Because of the entrenched system the entrenched party system that exists in our country, no matter which candidate is nominated from both party those are the two potential outcomes that someone could have to deal with.
Because these outcomes impact every individual and because for existence for instance, in certain areas republican leanings are much stronger than democratic leanings and vice versa, we think that given that there are areas that are so disproportionately skewed to one side, especially in those areas but also generally, people should have the ability to choose even amongst the ideology that they disagree with because for example, in this past election many people didn't approve of donald trump and many democratic supporters had they had the opportunity to vote in republican primaries likely would have chosen a more moderate option that they could have gone with, and they may have led to that having a better president or better a more preferable president in the status quo than what they achieved because they didn't have the chance to voice their opinion at that stage.
We think that's harmful to democracy.
We think that all people should have a say in who is going to govern them, and closed primaries only exclude the ability for that to occur.
Secondly, we think there are numerous pragmatic benefits that occur from open primaries both for the society and for the parties.
So firstly, we think that party moderation is much more likely to happen.
The reason for this is that when you don't have an echo chamber of your own of your own party determining who the nominee is going to be, but you allow for independent opposition views to have a say in who that person is going to be, we think that on balance this person is going to be more moderate.
One, because their policies have to attract a wider base of people and two, because the people that vote are going to tend to vote to one extreme if they're not all part of the same group.
Firstly, we think that this means that the candidates you get are going to be more moderate and thus more representative of what the average american believes and two, we think these people are going to be more electable because from they shift from the primary phase to the general election phase, they're already going to have the approval or at least the comparative approval of other people from people from independent in other parties.
The reason that this is good is obviously good for society when you have more agreement, more moderation.
We think this leads to less gridlock in congress and in state houses across the country and secondly, we think this is good for parties because it makes their candidates more competitive moving forward.
So we think that this is not only good for society but also the parties itself.
It also signals that these divides that we face in the status quo are not insurmountable.
It sends the message that people are able to engage and likely people are more likely to engage when they aren't restricted in who they're going to be chosen and when they're told that that ideology doesn't define them.
When you're told that being a democrat doesn't necessarily mean that you don't have the ability to have a say in how these parties, these two major pillars of american democracy, are going to function.
Given that constituents from both parties are impacted by the impacts of leaders no matter their party, we think that all constituents should have an impact to make a decision during the primary just like they would during the the general process the general election process.
And for this reason, open primaries in the united states are advantageous."
"We should increase wealth redistribution.
Our model for this is also really simple we think that we are just going to have an extremely high progressive tax.
This round is going to focus on the philosophical justification for wealth redistribution more than the mechanics, that's something that we think can get worked out later, but the profits of this kind of tax would be going into programs that specifically benefit those who are lower income.
So either this goes into money that is directly provided to individuals like single mothers or part of welfare, things like that, or it's going into education programs, outreach programs anything that essentially helps people who are lower income.
Two main arguments, first wealth redistribution is philosophically justified.
Recognize that wealthy people rarely got that way without assistance.
Because no one is actually a self made person.
More often, a lot of things had to align in order for that person to become successful.
You usually came from a family that had more money, obtained a good education, and the majority of the time went to an elite college.
Because recognize also we're not talking about upper middle class wealth.
We're talking about the top one percent kind of wealth.
The I'm a billionaire like donald trump bezos kind of wealth.
These kinds of things are incredibly different because there's a difference between someone who went to a state school after going to public school their whole life and was born to someone who may be was lower middle class and achieved higher middle class by like traveling up this pre-made ladder.
There's difference between that and the gap of billions and billions of dollars of the top one percent of individuals in our country.
And I think those are the people that we talk about when we talk about wealth redistribution.
It's about taking money from people who are insanely above their own kind of like visualization and imagination wealthy, and making sure that some of that money goes to people who need it more.
But even if we say that they got like people got to the point of wealth on their own, they don't stay wealthy without help from the lower class.
Like you have to get wealthy on the backs of those who are poor because it is the lower class that creates the labor that allows the rich to get rich.
Whether it's because they're producing a product or providing a service or simply consuming whatever it is this rich person had.
Even if that person like got rich by investing in stocks, all of this depended on people who were invested in those companies in other ways and working for the companies whose stocks you bought.
So either way your wealth came from the lower class so we think that redistributing some of that wealth back is only proper, and in fact there's an obligation to do so, in order to provide similar opportunities so that those people are not shackled by structural barriers but rather are able to go on and achieve things on their own.
Which brings us to our second argument about promoting upward mobility and individual growth.
Being in a lower class isn't just about how much money you have, it's about the opportunities a person and their children have access to in order to make money.
It's about the education they can obtain, the standard of living they can maintain and how much political power they wield.
When you're poor you tend to live in neighborhoods that have higher rates of crime, drug violence and gangs.
Your kids go to public schools in areas where property taxes are usually lower so the schools are worse.
You often have to work while obtaining an education so you can't focus on college and you can't focus on learning.
College and higher education is a lot less accessible as well, both financially and in terms of the strength of your application.
If your family has issues with food security, you're always going to be trying to balance your responsibilities with your hunger and all of this adds up to people being limited by much more than just their own hard work.
Rather, there are millions of of tiered issues that all create structural barriers to success and upward mobility.
Wealth redistribution empowers individuals to empower themselves.
Money that comes in from very high taxes on the rich goes into programs and government aid that then go to those were significantly poorer and allows them to change their lives.
Proud to oppose."
"Urbanization does more harm than good.
So by urbanization we mean the process by which people leave rural areas and move to large cities and towns.
We see that this is a process that has occurred throughout human history but is rapidly accelerated throughout the twentieth and early twenty first century.
Most people today now live in an urban area, which is a big change from a hundred years ago, and the concentration of people in urban areas is likely to rapidly increase according to UN metrics.
So we have two big arguments for why we think this is ultimately worse than it is good.
First of all we think that urbanization leads to a breakdown of social structures.
Most people around the world rely on family networks throughout their lives in order to support themselves when they need help.
For instance if you are a young mother and you need to work you can rely on a cousin, or aunt, or some other member of your extended family to do things like childcare, and to help you out.
We think that people can rely on families help much more unconditionally then they can rely on the help of others, often because there's a sort of tit for tat nature and an expectation that if, as a young person say, you take advantage of your family's help in the future you will get back to this community.
We see that this is lost though if your young people move to the city because that's generally how organization works.
We see lots and lots of young men moving to cities.
Relatively few elderly women, for instance, moving to cities.
So at that point people are taking and taking and taking from these networks as children and then abandoning them without doing they're just dues when they go to a city.
So these networks fall apart for a couple of reasons.
One, because the people are actually leaving and can't participate and two, because the expectation of a return on your investment, so to speak, is lost.
Why help out the children in your family if you think that they're just going to leave and go to the capital as soon as they get old enough to?
So we think that this causes a breakdown in a really powerful support network that can really help people when they fall on hard times.
Individuals who don't have access to a lot of government support, like people living in developing countries, might have family as their only support network but it's undermined by urbanization.
In the same way we think that traditional culture is often lost.
If your traditional beliefs require that you travel to a certain area or that you communicate with a certain religious leader and you live hundreds of miles away in a big city, we think that you're unlikely to be able to continue that.
We also don't think that you're going to replace this culture with something better.
Instead we think it's likely that you will continue to practice some sort of base form of your old culture that loses much of its meaning without the place in which it was set, or that you will completely give up on your local culture and instead participate in global westernized culture.
We think that ultimately this leads to people adopting american and western culture and abandoning their own traditional culture which has the effect of making everyone around the world more or less the same and eliminating the diversity that makes the world such an interesting place to live.
So our second argument is about what we think broadly speaking this will be to lower quality of life for the people moving to cities.
This isn't really a debate about people moving from, say, rural america to new york city because highly developed countries have already urbanized to an extremely high degree and are unlikely to organize further.
We think that this is a debate more about people moving from rural morocco to the slums around marrakesh.
Recognize that many of the world's largest cities are now in developing countries but that most of the people who live in them don't live in the really fancy nice areas that tourists see if you visit these areas.
They live in slums that are kind of out of sight and out of mind and this is where urbanization is growing.
It's not lots and lots of people moving into nice apartments in high rise buildings.
Its people living in little shanty towns reminiscent of america in the great depression.
These areas are rife with disease and poverty and crime and little opportunity for people to advance themselves or care for their families.
We think that in rural life you have many more opportunities to feed yourself, to fall back on your community, but because people are lured to the city on false pretenses and expectations partially based on hollywood, partially based on lies told to them by potential employers, that ultimately you will be better off staying in the countryside than moving to a city.
For these reasons we think that urbanization does more harm than good."
"We should subsidize electric cars.
So in this debate we're not talking about hybrid cars like a prius, we're talking about fully electric cars like the tesla.
And I think that we're talking about countries that already have a domestic industry surrounding these cars.
So places like the US, like germany, like japan, that are already manufacturing electric cars today.
So with that in mind we have two main points.
The first, it's about the environment and the second is about domestic industry.
So in terms of the environment, we think it's clear that we need to move towards electric cars in order to reduce the use of fossil fuels.
We see that transportation is one of the primary drivers of fossil fuel emissions in the status quo.
People are using way too much gasoline to get work every day and we could drastically reduce that by using electric cars.
Why is this true?
First of all energy production at the grid bubble is much more effective.
So in terms of actually reducing carbon emissions the grid is already much cleaner than any individual car.
In countries like the US, germany, japan, you have a mix of alternative energies playing into that grid and you also the use of things like natural gas, you're not just burning a bunch of gasoline.
So we see that we need people to be driving electric cars and the way to do that is to reduce the cost.
If you make it so that a tesla costs about the same amount as you know, a new ford then people are going to be much more likely to be willing to buy the tesla.
But on top of that, we tell you that you can also facilitate the development of new technology that will benefit the environment in the future.
By subsidizing electric cars you don't just get cars at the end.
You get better batteries, you get a better understanding of alternative fuel sources, you get people who are doing research into other sustainable uses of this technology.
So ultimately we think that although you put a lot of money into this one project, the benefits will disperse widely.
If you want an example of how this has worked in the past, think about the moon landing.
It's actually useless to send a man to the moon but the technology that we got from that, things like microwaves, things like ballpoint pens, all of these great things that we have today that make our lives better, are a result of that one project.
We think that investing heavily in electric cars could have a similar spillover affect.
Our second point is about domestic industry.
So when you subsidize electric cars in your own country you put a lot of money into research and development in your country.
We think this means that more young people will go into those fields that are being subsidized.
So you'll have more engineers, more scientists, all these other things which will ultimately make your country more competitive in the long term in the high tech sector and in automotives as well.
We also see that by subsidizing this you're going to see increased production of electric cars.
Which means that you'll create manufacturing jobs.
Recognize that manufacturing for subsidized industries like defense is already a major source of good, union jobs in countries like the US and germany that have large arms industry.
We just want to extend that into the civilian sphere through electric cars.
And on top of that, we think that you're also going to have a new industry bloom up in order to service all of these electric cars.
Right now very few people are licensed or able to service electric cars but if you put millions more of them on the road through subsidies, than we think that ultimately you're going to see an industry crop up that will create new jobs for people to supply and service these cars.
Now the other team might tell you that by putting all of this money into subsidies you're helping people who already have enough money, who don't really need any help, because the lowest income people aren't going to be purchasing electric cars.
But we think that the benefits to the environment and the job benefits created will ultimately help some of those who are in a difficult economic position right now.
There will be more good jobs for people without a college degree from this manufacturing and also more opportunities for people to go on to do higher education as a result of these subsidies for things like engineering and so on.
So for these two reasons, the both benefits to the environment and benefits to domestic industry, we should subsidize electric cars.
Thank you."
"The free market brings more good than harm.
So by the free market, we mean a system in which there is effectively very little regulation besides contracts being enforced, and people exchange goods for services, money can be exchanged freely, and people can charge or pay as much as they want for something.
So we have three main arguments for why we think the free market is good.
The first is about innovation.
We think that on the free market, there is a lot of incentive for people to innovate to create new ideas.
Why?
If you go to market with the same old ideas that everyone else has, it'll be very difficult to compete.
There is a tendency for a few actors to eventually control most of a market for a certain good or service, perhaps not total monopoly on a really free market, but a tendency for a few large providers to ultimately outcompete everyone else, which means that in order to succeed, you need to bring something innovative or new to the market.
What this means is that you directly tie people's interest to creating new ideas, new goods, new services.
We think that this does more good than harm because it leads to new solutions to old problems.
Without the free market, you might run into a situation where people don't have to innovate in order to succeed, such as if you have a lot of regulation that allows people to compete at an equal rate, using old ideas that they didn't come up with.
Now at that point, you wouldn't have things like new cures for diseases coming to the market.
You wouldn't have machines that can improve people's quality of life.
We would rather live in a world where people are taking risks to develop new drugs, to create new technologies that can let us feed the hungry and provide clean water to children who don't have it right now, and you only get that because of this incentive to innovate.
Our second argument is about efficiency.
So, on the free market, you don't have all the protections of regulation, which means that if you can cut a dollar here, then that's a dollar going into your pocket.
If you're spending too much money compared to your competitors, then you're going to go out of business and not be able to compete anymore.
What this means is that prices are going to be driven to the lowest possible level at which a service can still be provided.
This is obviously a good thing for consumers, because it means that even the very poor in a society can afford more goods by comparison.
But it's also good for posterity because it means that in the future, new goods, new services, new technologies will be built up on an understanding of efficiency, of cutting the fat, of doing everything with as little as possible.
And that will lead to more resources being available for investment back into the economy, back into new businesses that will just feed back into the innovation that we told you about before.
Our last argument is about maximizing personal freedom.
We think that regulation often prevents people from starting businesses that they would have otherwise been able to start and succeed at, for unintended consequences.
You have almost side effects of regulation, for instance.
What we get through the free market is a world in which people have the most control over how they spend their time, over how they conduct their business.
And since individuals are the best arbiter of what is good for themselves, every person has more information about their own interest than the government or any other actor.
We think that individuals will allocate their time more effectively, that individuals will better act in such a way as to facilitate their own happiness and success because of the free market.
At the end of the day, therefore, people will be able to act in such a way that will liberate themselves and their families.
You'll see people from different backgrounds being better able to approach the market, because they're able to do it in a way that suits themselves.
We think that this will encourage more innovation and efficiency, but also lead to more personal happiness and fulfillment.
So for these reasons, the free market brings more good than harm.
Thank you."
"We should ban extreme sports, because at the end of the day, a lot of extreme sports are rather inhumane, or cause a lot of problematic social norms, that result in personal injury for people.
So, first, before we get into those arguments, I want to talk about what we actually mean by extreme sports.
I think that in a lot of ways, the thing that defines an extreme sport is the inherency of the danger to it.
So oftentimes, this could be something like boxing, for example, or things that are more generally accepted as extreme sports, so things like, maybe like, downhill skiing, or more precisely like skateboarding, or things like that, other kinds of things like that.
So, let's get into the argument, I think there's an important thing to note, as far as what we conceptualize as humanity in sports, because obviously we don't have things like gladiator fights anymore, where people, like, fight to severe injury, or even death, because, it's seen as just barbaric, or inhumane.
I think that it's important to first point out that, the more obvious appearance of serious injury or death isn't necessarily the only thing that we can consider, because there's a lot of obvious dangers to things that , a lot of sports that exist.
So things like boxing, that can result in severe head trauma, and severe injuries, both in the short term, and in the long term, or about how, if you're doing something like snowboarding, for example, and you wipe out, you can have a whole lot of broken bones, and a whole lot of substantial injuries, and a whole lot of substantial injuries, that are quite bad.
So, obviously the inherency of danger is very problematic, but I think that it's also important to note this, because in a lot of ways, there's a sadistic element to these things, in that it's not just that the danger exists, but the danger of the injury is almost what we get the entertainment out of, and I think that's where the real in humanity lies.
When you see someone wipe out, when they're doing like a snowboarding trip, and they possibly even injure yourself, that is, ultimately, what leads like the one million clips on clicks on youtube, or that or in boxing, when you see someone throw that extra hard punch, that you just knock that person out, that is what draws people into the sport, and keeps them involved in invest in that sport in the first place.
And I think that's a real problem, because it's in a lot of ways commodifying the injuries of people, it's sensationalizing an actual suffering and trauma, that people experience, and I think that that's something that, simply, if we want to be a society that doesn't glorify violence, a society that thinks that, violence isn't something that we should appreciate, that's very important.
And I think the reason for that is because, it's impossible to necessarily separate the people that we watch on TV in extreme sports as athletes, it's impossible to separate them from role models, or people of influence in society.
And the reason for that is just because, they have so many people that watch what they're doing, and they have so many people that appreciate what they're doing, that they have like a real voice in a lot of things, and that they have a real influence on things.
So this manifests itself in a couple of ways: first and foremost, you have people who aren't professionals maybe trying to do snowboarding tricks, or trying to do skateboarding tricks, or things like that.
These people try to emulate the professionals, and they're in , as extreme sports, but sense they're amateurs, they're even more likely to get injured, they're even more likely to do things in an unsafe way.
So, I think what that results in, is a whole lot of people resulting in things that are going to harm themselves.
But even more broadly than that, I also think that it generally normalizes violence.
When you look at something like boxing, and you're willing to just have a stadium of people cheering for you to beat the crap out of somebody, I think that there's an inherent problem there.
Because, if we want to tell our children, and if we want to tell society: violence isn't the answer, you should try to come up with alternate means to violence, but yet when we see violence in our society, we're willing to pay money to watch people do that, we're willing to cheer for violence, I think that that's sending, not just a mixed signal, it's sending the opposite signal altogether.
So, if we really want to move forward in society, we have to ban extreme sports."
"We should lower at the age of consent.
So we think it's very important to set up a model in this debate.
So we have one particular model in mind.
The way that we would lower the age of consent is to follow a model that's similar to the state of new jersey in which any one of the age so the status quo in many states and many federal districts the age of consent eighteen so we would lower it to a baseline of sixteen.
Anyone at the age of sixteen may consent to intercourse with anyone older than them and for people between the ages of fourteen and sixteen so people that are adolescents but in high school and often aren't sexually active, we would ensure that those people from fourteen to sixteen may have intercourse with anyone that is up to four years older than them.
So if you're age fourteen you can have sex with anyone up to the age of eighteen as long as they aren't four years and one day.
We recognize that this is arbitrary but we think it leaves room for people who are young and sexually active to be sexually active with one another without having to face criminal charges that could last that could be on their record for a very long time.
We would also because there is some discrepancy between laws regulating hetero and homosexual acts we would say that this is going to be the same across the board whether or not your straight or gay or what have you.
Okay two reasons why we think we should lower the age of consent.
The first is that it's crucial to recognize that the age of consent is arbitrary.
The point of the age of consent itself doesn't have to do with whether or not we think eighteen year olds or seventeen year olds or sixteen year olds are the most mature and the most ready to be able to have sexual intercourse but it's trying to draw an arbitrary line so that we can avoid people being abused, so we can avoid people that are below a certain age being abused by those that might have influence or control over them.
We think our model does just that.
We think that we allow to maximize autonomy for individuals who have already likely been in in an atmosphere in high school where they have been around consenting individuals and may have been in a sexualized environment.
It allows them to express and learn about themselves sexually.
We think that at age sixteen people are very likely to be sexually active and it's not unreasonable for them to follow their biological urges and do these types of things.
We also think that when you set this age limit of four years for people that are on the younger side in high school, it insures that people won't face the type of abuse that we're concerned with.
They won't face the possibility of adults who have immense amount of power course of ability over them to coerce them into having sex and of course if it were to happen this would still be made illegal.
Given that this is an arbitrary line, we think that we allow for young relationships and we allow for maximum autonomy.
We think that what the state should be focusing on is ensuring that people are about to maximize their freedom and maximize their individual decision making and we think that lowering the age of consent to one in which people are still being sexually active, recognize that people below the age of eighteen have sex all the time they're sexually active all the time and these are actions that could end up on a record for them that could give them that could result in them being left out of jobs or other opportunities in the future just for being a normal high schooler.
So we think that this is simply unfair and that because of that, we need to lower the age of consent.
We think that you ought defer to autonomy.
We think that's and so sixteen is a line that we think is also fair given what sixteen allows you to do.
In the united states at sixteen you can leave high school, you can work, you can live on your own.
You're allowed to in a sense be a full adult.
While you can't do certain things like drink and vote, these are still ways in which you are allowed to live an autonomous life and we think that what falls in line with an autonomous life is being able to explore yourself and explore your sexuality and so we think sixteen, while it is certainly an arbitrary line, is a fair line.
We think that unless you entrust people with their sexual development they can never learn to flourish and be comfortable in their sexual in their sexuality and be comfortable with themselves in a sexual sense and we think that at age sixteen if we're gonna allow people to have the possibility of being independent in all these other areas, there they they should also be autonomous in their ability to choose what their sexual life is going to be like.
Given that the age of consent is arbitrary and lowering it would fall more in line with the lines of autonomy that we grant to people in the status quo in other spheres, we believe we should lower the age of consent."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should cancel pride parades.
The model we're not saying that this is like a government thing, we think that the organizations themselves should choose to shut down the events that they're hosting and this would be like a preferable world.
Three main areas of clash.
First on why it puts a target in a much easier way than any other like everyday event.
So recognize that the LGBTQ community is already at most risk to be targeted for a hate crime.
We think that when you take those who are most marginalized and most likely to be attacked and place larger than normal quantities of them in a specific area at a specific time and label that as like a relatively peaceful area and a very like friendly and safe space, you're basically inviting someone who dislikes that group of people to come and put an end to this and make a really loud statement while doing so.
We already see that many pride parades have attacks that occur at them like in israel it's very common for pride parades to be the focus of stabbings we've seen in the united states that pride parades have been targeted and so we think that this opens them up to attack that the organization should have to protect these people from, especially since so many who go to pride parades are young, they're oftentimes less inhibited, they're coming in from an area of not understanding necessarily how bad things can get or what their risk is.
They just think they're going out to have fun and so that you end up with a false sense of security they think that they're in this safe space when in reality they're more dangerous they're like more in harm's way than they've ever been.
And so even if you think that the organizers don't necessarily have an obligation to those who attend their parades, we definitely think they have an obligation to those who are especially young or especially uninhibited at these parades.
But the second way in which there there is a target on pride parades is in terms of counter protests.
We think that you're really likely to end up with gatherings of conservatives who are going to show up and try and show you why you are wrong about your beliefs and this oftentimes leads to a lot more potential violence, there's more much more likely to be conflict and verbal conflict between groups and all of this can be avoided if your event does not occur.
Second area of clashe is why it's bad for public opinion because there are a lot of republican moderates who in theory are in favor of gay rights.
They consider themselves egalitarian and they're like they consider themselves very forward thinking for republicans.
However these people get really oppositional when they feel like that gayness is rubbed in their faces or when they feel like this is somehow being forced down their throats.
So at the point that moderates get incredibly turned-off by like flamboyant expressions of LGBTQ culture or any kind of like BDSM mention, we don't think that the parade is worth the lack of political solvency that that comes afterwards.
We think it's way more important to get good politics passed for LGBTQ individuals like marriage equality or getting better laws for LGBTQ youth or making it easier for LGBTQ youth who were who were affected by their parents or disowned by their parents to get emancipated things like that are infinitely more important than an evening of frolicking.
Our third area of clash is why this puts undue power in organizers hands because you're having a million person operation run buy a few like maybe five, ten people and those people get to do a lot of things that are like unique to their power over the event.
In the case of the recent pride we had I don't remember where but the recent one where they were able to ban jewish stars and call them zionist expressions we think that things like that occur only when you allow a few people in control of it.
But the problem is that it's not as if those few people have to take responsibility for their action, rather the entire group gets blamed for what a few people did.
We don't think that those people should have the ability to tarnish the name of a group of people as much as they do and so we think they should relinquish that power and cancel pride.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should abolish intellectual property rights.
What we think this looks like in practice is removing the ability for people to patent things, the ability for people to take ownership over things like entertainment media that is created other types of intellectual property, anything that is the creation of the mind or anything that has been derived from an idea that you had.
We don't think that people should have ownership over these things.
So firstly, why do we think that these ideas cannot be owned in a very fundamental manner?
We think that all ideas are the result of human history.
That all creation and all things that are created have only been able to be derived because of human advancement.
The ability for you to create some new technology in the present relies on centuries of societal, social, and economic as well as scientific progress that made modern technology and modern creation possible.
It also all ideas that all people have rely on educational system that's created by the society they find themselves in, one that educates them and provides them with the tools that allow them to treat these types of things, to create what is currently intellectual property.
We also think that many of these things come over the course of collaboration, tacit collaboration and direct collaboration and therefore we don't think that it is fair to give any one person ownership because all ideas are grown out of the community.
No person independently created any of their intellectual property.
We don't think that it is proper like property that you can own physical property that people should have ownership over these things because they were spawn not by a market but by society and by people.
So given that we think it is principally more just that intellectual property rights be abolished and that these things are principally unjustified.
What do we think are three tangible gains from abolishing intellectual property rights?
The first is increased innovation and second followed closely is increased knowledge.
They go hand in hand.
When you don't have intellectual property rights it means that ownership of ideas, things like scientific discoveries, things like technological innovations, these types of things aren't protected by IP laws which means the information about them is much more freely available.
This means that people are more capable of learning about these types of things and they're more capable of incorporating different ideas into their own technology, into their own creations, into their own growth.
What do we think this means?
We think it means that you get longer and broader innovation in the long term.
In the short term, we think that people are more likely to collaborate.
People are less likely to be secretive about ideas which means we think that we can falsify like bad ideas quickly.
We think that technology is more efficient right off the start because we think that people are less likely or less incentivized to quickly bring ideas to market so that they can patent use types of things and we think that long term you get a society that has greater innovation because you're more able to synthesize ideas that that otherwise would've been blocked by intellectual property protection.
So the second big gain that we think you get from abolishing intellectual property rights is breaking down unfair monopolies.
So a major issue on which this exists is pharmaceuticals.
In the status quo, pharmaceutical companies are able to bring pills to market and charge exorbitant prices because they have long term control over the pharmaceutical because you can't make any sort of copy of that pharmaceutical for twenty years after its been patented.
The problem with this is that in this market and in many other markets this massively drives up consumer prices because it creates overt monopolies.
If you abolish intellectual property rights and you allow for fair competition to take place in the market in which you don't just get the first movers advantage by having the idea first, or finishing the technology first, but rather you're forced to compete with every other entity in the market that is capable of producing these things.
We think you get these types of material products on a better scale.
We think you get them cheaper and you get a more efficiently than before because we think intellectual property is principally unjust and there are massive social gains from abolishing it.
We should abolish intellectual property rights."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion, that we should ban abortion.
We really have one point here, and that's that life is something that is irreplaceable, and that when life is extinguished, that is an incredible harm that we should actively avoid.
So, I want to start by establishing why these fetuses have a claim to life, and why that is something that is intrinsically true.
I think there's three standards, at which you can look at this from.
The first is just sort of the animal rights activists standard, of like do they experience pain or pleasure, and if they respond to these stimuli, in a way that signal some sort of like negative reaction to pain and pleasure, then they have rights.
I think a lot of scientific data has come out suggesting that fetuses do experience pain and pleasure, and do fall under this category.
I think this is, generally speaking, a good standard by which to determine whether or not something has a right to life, because it determines whether or not suffering is intrinsic to that, and at the most basic level, suffering is the one thing that we can just like absolutely prescribe as a bad thing to happen, and that when there is suffering in the world, that is a harm.
So, insofar as fetuses experience pain and pleasure, that is a reason to to preserve their life.
Second, we would say, like the really liberal standard, like this is like, bug rights and bacteria rights activists, is to say: well, can it move?
Like, is it a mobile thing, and does it like, have some clear understanding of like being able to make decisions, that, again, fetuses very clearly do.
They actively, like, make these subconscious decisions, and these decisions are like what allows them to survive in the womb.
I think the third standard, and this is really important, and merits some analysis, is future life, and whether or not that is something worth preserving.
So, first, establish the distinction of what a future life is.
I think, generally speaking, we can define this as someone, in the future, who will meet one of the standards of life.
You know, even if you take the really conservative position, of like: oh, well, it has to be a human, and everything else can just go crawl off and die, like, it has to need a standard of what life constitutes, and what things that have a meaningful claim to a right to life actually are.
Given that, I think that what a future life is, in terms of its worth, is equal to a present life.
The reason for this is that like, humans brains, right?
Like, operate like in a linear time.
That is to say, that like, we think about things in the order in which they happen.
That however is pretty arbitrary.
That if something bad happened in the past, we regard it to be bad, but if something bad is going to happen in the future, we don't think about it as much.
We think of it as a thing that is preventable maybe, but we don't see it as an actual harm, and I think that's a problem, because realistically a harm is a harm, and regardless of when it happens, it happens.
Likewise, we should think of benefits, in the same way.
That if someone is going to half life in the future, and if we consider that to be something that we value, then we should fight to be sure, that that life is going to be experienced.
So, let's say that you take the really strict definition of what constitutes life, and you don't think that these children have life right now.
Fine.
But they're going to in the future, and that's something worth preserving.
I think that future life is something that has a meaningful claim to any sort of rights framework that we prescribe to it, on the basis of the fact that it is equally capable of experiencing pain and pleasure, as someone in the present is.
Given that then, I think killing is bad.
It is the most basic rights violation that someone can undergo, and I think it really significantly outweighs most other rights violations, that we can discuss here.
Given that, this is something that is worth preserving, proud to propose."
"We should introduce a pollution tax.
By this we mean that we should tax companies for emitting poisonous chemicals or other emissions into the environment.
We think that in particular we could target greenhouse gases because of the risk that they pose to changing the global climate.
With that model in mind, we have three arguments for our side.
The first is that we need to make companies internalize the cost of their actions.
The reason why companies burn so many fossil fuels and release so many polluting chemicals into the environment is that they don't have to pay for the cleanup.
Ultimately companies pollute the environment and make lots and lots of money and the government has to pay to go in and clean up the mess that they leave behind.
What we have right now is a system where you privatize all of the profits and make all of the drawbacks public.
This has to change, we need to force these companies to absorb the cost of the way that they do business.
Many of them will go out of business immediately they just won't be able to pay for the harms that they're doing, but what that means is that these businesses were never worth it in the first place since ultimately they were doing more harm than good or they would have been able to pay this tax.
We think it's very likely that many companies will completely change the way that they do business.
For instance that companies will start adopting electric cars even if they're more expensive than gas powered cars but this is necessary in the long term in order to prevent climate change so we think that forcing them to do it now will just reduce the amount that it costs to make changes to fight climate change in the future since we will have already taken steps to limit its effects.
We'd also like to point out that ultimately the only way to fight climate change is going to be to spend trillions of dollars on infrastructure.
Once sea levels rise cities like new york and boston are going to be under water or very close to being under water.
We're going to have to build dikes around some of the world's largest cities.
Massive populations from countries like bangladesh are going to have to be resettled elsewhere as their countries become inundated with water.
Climate change is going to be the most expensive problem that the world has ever faced and the only way to overcome it is going to be to raise revenues so that the state can fight against it.
What better way than to tax the people who are making this necessary in the first place.
We think that given that we need lots of money to fight against climate change and given that some of the most profitable companies in the world would be affected by this tax that ultimately this is the best way to make these people pay for what they've done and also to help those in the future who suffer from their actions.
And even if you think that this isn't all going to be spent on climate change it's still probably better to have the government have the money than exxon mobil.
After all, most of what the state spends its money on is socially utile.
It might be spent on schools or education or roads but probably anything is better than having this money go into the pockets of wealthy investors.
At the end of the day, much of government policy is based on separating the wealthy from their money in order to provide for everyone else and this is a particularly effective and just way to do so.
Which leads into our final argument, that this is a tax on the people who can most afford to bear it.
We think that a good tax should be set on the shoulders of the people who can afford that tax rather than being set on everyones' shoulders.
This is why for instance progressive taxes are preferable to flat taxes, because the people who pay the most are those who can afford to pay the most.
A pollution tax will work similarly.
The companies who make the most money off of cheap energy will be the ones who have to pay the most in pollution taxes which means that ultimately it will be the people who have received the most benefit who pay the most in tax which we think is fair since those will be the people with the most money in the first place.
For all of these reasons we should implement a pollution tax.
Thank you."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should abolish monarchies.
I think there's a bit of variation worldwide about what the extent of the power of monarchies is.
In many european countries, for example, monarchs are more or less figureheads.
They sometimes have the capacity to be heads of state and have some role in foreign relations issues, but they are largely not going to be decision makers.
They don't pass legislation, any of that sort of thing.
In other countries, they literally run everything in the country, such as like in the middle east, in saudi arabia is an excellent example of this.
So we're going to make arguments for both of these, but I do want to note that some of these arguments will obviously apply to both.
So, three independent points: first is that monarchies in figurehead states constitute a large waste in public expenditures.
So, in these countries where the monarchies aren't actually vital to any sort of government function, they are a large drain on the taxpayer.
You're paying for a large mansion, you're paying for services afforded for free to these individuals.
There's an opulent lifestyle for these people that really haven't done anything to earn that opulent lifestyle, and it's being propped up by taxpayers, people that don't have much of a choice one way or another about if they're actually going to sustain these people.
This is fundamentally unjust.
I don't think that there has to be a lot of warranting here as to why it is bad when tons of working class people are being forced to just pay for silly expenditures generated by a royal family within a country.
But I think it's important to note that this is something that is fundamentally ridiculous and that this money can be transferred to much more meaningful expenditures like, say, homeless services, or like mental health services, or any number of the examples of things you can think of that are drastically underfunded.
Our second independent point is that when it comes to places where the monarchies do make meaningful decisions, those systems are fundamentally undemocratic.
People, I think it goes without saying, have the right to make decisions about what's going to happen in their own lives.
This is the reason that we care about democracy: that giving people autonomy over the rules that are going to be imposed on them is fundamentally important to our general right to autonomy.
Given that, it is a problem when individuals or even families can unilaterally make decisions that affect tons of other people.
We're okay with this in republican democracies, but only because people actually have the ability to affect what those decisions are being what decisions are being made.
In a monarchy, that capacity is extremely limited.
The only real way to put pressure on a monarchy is through like threat of revolution or something, which carries enormous risk with it.
So I don't think then it is reasonable to say that people have any sort of meaningful autonomy when it comes to relations with their governments under monarchies.
This is an extreme problem and it should be done away with.
Our third independent point though is that something that really applies to both of these, although it is much more extreme in impact under meaningful monarchies where they actually make decisions, and that's that you have people who are given public platforms to shape norms that aren't warranted.
So the queen of england gets to wax poetic about whatever it is she feels like talking about.
And that's all well and fine except that, generally speaking, people treat her as an authority, someone who is qualified to speak on these issues.
That's a problem because people take this advice to heart.
They consider it to be things that are actually like almost objectively correct in some circles.
But the person that is making these proclamations hasn't done anything to warrant the mass amount of authority that has been given to that position.
That position is a product of the family they were born into, not any sort of effort they put towards learning the issue, not towards any sort of expertise they have in it.
And then as a result, public policy and public opinion is shaped around that unwarranted position.
Given that, we think there's a profound impact on what people's considerations of the truth are, and when this shapes into government policy, what the effects on their day-to-day lives are.
Proud to propose."
"We should cancel the patriot act.
In this round, we're gonna make two broad arguments about why the patriot act should never have been passed and why it must be canceled.
The first is about constitutionality and why independent of outcomes, the patriot act should not exist, and secondly, about why there are better ways and other ways of preventing attacks that do a better job of meeting those constitutional and governmental standards.
So, on constitutionality.
Roe v wade, among among as well as other cases in the US supreme court, have found that there is a right to privacy in the constitution, and multiple other rulings have upheld that idea, that you have a right to a divide between public and private life, that you have a right to have some sort of space to retreat into being your private sphere.
The patriot act massively violates this by expanding the ability for us to perform, for the united states, that is, to perform intelligence operations and gathering without a warrant and to do such and do such things like bulk information gathering that does things like track phones and messaging, location, and tons of other information, simply from the devices that someone has on them.
The patriot act massively expanded the ability for the US to conduct surveillance operations not just on foreign actors, but also on those that exist within the united states, on citizens of the united states.
That goes directly against the constitutional right that these people have to privacy.
Why is unconstitutionality bad?
So, independent of all other impacts in this round, why is unconstitutionality something that we cannot allow to happen?
It's because the constitution has a purpose and that purpose is to bind government action.
It sets the boundaries of legitimate behavior that the government can take.
It doesn't say what the government must do, but it says that the government cannot act outside of these basic ideas, outside of these basic outside of this basic road map.
And to ignore that is to give the government free reign to act in any way that it sees fit.
It doesn't it removes a road map entirely from the government and creates a slippery slope towards further government infractions and further infractions of those rights that are outlined in the constitution.
We think that without that road map, the government can never be just.
It can never get the consent of its people if it's able to act without any recognition for the constitution, and that alone is a reason to cancel the patriot act.
So what are those other pragmatic harms that come from this?
Because we think you need to balance privacy with security, that there's also a right to life that is both implicit in the constitution, but also the explicit job of the government.
And the patriot act simply does not do a good job of striking that balance.
So, how can we better strike that balance?
Firstly, we would say that you cannot spy on US citizens, that in order to conduct those types of spy operations, maybe you don't need a publicly open warrant, but you need to get some sort of warrant, some sort of certification from a court system.
And you just need to show some sort of probable cause for this.
This is an an incredibly high barrier.
We also think that working with allies and using diplomacy to to gather intelligence on foreign actors is a much more a much more friendly, especially internationally friendly, approach to intelligence gathering instead of breaking into the wireless and internet systems of foreign countries and trying to observe their citizens without any of the consent of those countries.
We think that working with our allies, working with foreign actors, is something that's going to build camaraderie abroad and also probably going to lead to more specific intelligence, to more useful intelligence in the long run.
We can also also use our tech to strengthen cybersecurity and prevent new types of of threats from springing up.
In the twenty-first century, we're facing not just bombings and other terrorist acts, but attacks on our in on our infrastructure, on our internet infrastructure.
And upholding our cybersecurity can go a long way in preventing these types of harms, and more target intelligence, rather than bulk collection that the patriot act allows for, we think that these are all ways of striking a balance between privacy and security.
They keep us safe, but they don't go beyond constitutional means.
For these reasons, we should cancel the patriot act."
"We should end daylight saving time.
We think that when daylight saving times were invented, it was for a time that is long be gone.
Our own time today.
These things were instituted, for example, to ensure that farmers could work at times, in which the daylight was out, and so in a largely agrarian society, it was important for farmers to be able to work, because there wasn't light to work during the night, and you have to adjust for these things, because commerce require daylight in order to be effective, and because heating and using electricity at night was much more expensive, so marginal increases in use, so using electricity more at night, so that you could run a business, had a much higher impact than it does today, in which electricity consumption, at least at the margins, isn't all that important.
We think that daylight saving time is something that was created for a time, that simply is not a parallel to what we're experiencing now.
And because of this, we do not think that it is useful for modern society, and in fact we think it is quite harmful.
So, we're going to talk about the the ways in which daylight saving time is majorly disruptive, and that is why we think that it should be ended.
So, firstly, every human being behaves based on a circadian rhythm, that is developed in their body, based on when they're awake, and when they're asleep.
The same circadian rhythm is what wakes you up in the morning without an alarm, is what causes you to become tired at roughly the same times, if you have a healthy sleeping pattern.
Well, the problem with this is that daylight saving time disrupts the circadian rhythm, it forces individuals to adjust, whether it's to go to sleep an hour earlier, or to wake up an hour earlier, or what have you.
And large disruptions in the circadian rhythm, such as having one fewer hours to sleep than you're used to, or having one more hour to sleep, can cause real effects in the following days, and what this accumulates to is that, in the workforce, people are much less productive in the days following daylight saving time, a time switch.
What this what this looks like is people that were spending more time browsing the internet than doing actual work, it results in them getting there later at work, and it can accumulate to much higher difficulty, such as an increase in driving accidents the day following daylight saving time, because people are more likely to be asleep.
These these have real ramifications, both in the fact that people are more likely to be harmed, or killed in a traffic accident, people are more likely to have a heart attack, or be or be exposed to increasingly stressful situations, and the economic impact.
This is not minute.
Studies show that, in the united states alone, daylight saving time could have an approximately five hundred million dollars cost on the US economy.
Now, this is a marginal amount compared to the GDP of the united states, but recognize that this is just one day, one hour, one minor switch, that, because there are because the purposes of this switch are so outdated, there are no tangible gains to keeping the system in place.
The whole reason the system continues to be in place is because it is our tradition, it's what we've always done, and it's much easier to continue doing things than to change them.
But, recognize that not only is daylight saving time incredibly harmful to productivity, but it's also something that's unpopular.
It's what leads to children going out at the break of dawn to go get a school bus, and it leads to people waking up when it's still dark outside.
People don't like daylight saving time, they don't like the fact that they are not living their lives in accordance when when the sun is up, and when the sun is down, and daylight saving time results in a situation in which that is the case.
The system itself is wildly unpopular, it has only detriments at this point, because the purposes of the system are no longer something that we need to be concerned with as a society.
And for all these reasons, we should end daylight saving times."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should seek to achieve universal healthcare.
While I think this is more debate about the goal rather than the specific policy you know I think broadly speaking we would just endorse any policy that seeks to achieve universal healthcare.
Obviously some policies are better than others but probably shouldn't be a debate about like whether or not single-payer is like the mechanism to achieve it rather just the goal of enacting universal health care and ensuring that everyone has coverage through like insurance.
So the first thing I'd like to establish is that healthcare is a right and this is the sort of the first independent argument is that healthcare is a right and specifically health care that is like insurance to ensure that you can actually get you know the sort of the sort of health care that you need.
So insurance is pretty critical to ensuring really thorough health care while it might not be necessary for your like six month physician visits or whenever, it's really important for ensuring that when you have something that is like truly disastrous if you have something that is truly disastrous that you are capable of paying for it.
For a lot of people you know this is this is a make or break situation people can go absolutely bankrupt on expensive procedures that they really didn't have any way to produce or or to prevent rather.
This when you're talking about you know something like like an aneurysm, this is an expensive procedure to try and mitigate the harms of it but it's not really something that you can do much to prevent and I think that's important.
Health is something that is intrinsically important to the individual's right structure.
When we talk about your right to life obviously your right to you know health and you know not you know dying on the operating table by lack of insurance is is is facilitative to ensuring your right to life.
So this is something that's really fundamentally important to ensure that every person has access to, that at the point where healthcare to actually have the capacity to pay for these operations is facilitative to your right to life, this is something that we should take active steps to ensure that everybody has access to.
And I don't think that you know ability to pay should really determine whether or not you get to live.
Our second independent point is that even for the people who can afford insurance either way, this just makes for a better society.
So one way in which this happens is through spread of illness.
That is in a society where you have a lot of people that can't afford basic coverage that just get sick more frequently because of their lack of ability to you know see a physician or get proper medicine, that that creates problems for the the people with insurance because it makes them more likely to get sick when lots of other people are also sick.
But beyond that it makes for better work force.
From an economic perspective it's better when your country is just healthier when they're you know less people taking sick days when they're less taking prolonged leaves for medical reasons having a society that is able to you know continue its work force with more regularity because you don't have these interruptions due to health care issues is really beneficial at a macro level for everybody.
So even if you take this from like this really really self centered perspective of just well you know what I'm out for number one I think there are still really tangible benefits to ensuring that other people have proper access to healthcare.
And the last thing I want to discuss here and the third independent point is that it mitigates inequity.
A large driver of cyclical poverty and why people who are born into poverty have trouble escaping it is health care.
That is that it is difficult to escape poverty when you are you know paying lots of money for health care procedures that other people normally wouldn't have to deal with.
I think when you have universal coverage and when you have the insurance essentially to make sure that people you know don't have to worry about whether or not you know their healthcare is going to bankrupt them, their healthcare costs are going to bankrupt them, I think you have a society that makes it a lot more possible for people to have upward social mobility and be able to escape cycles of poverty.
Proud to propose."
"We should increase tax credits.
The model for this is really simple.
We think that in a choice between adding deductions or adding tax credits, we would prefer tax credits.
Which the difference is just that rather than having a deduction being some percentage of the amount of money that you owe not being owed anymore.
A tax credit is just subtracted from your end total tax liability.
And we think that we should have more of those and in a decision between the two we should choose credits.
Two main arguments, first on why it is better for the people.
Tax credits reduce your taxes dollar for dollar, while standard deductions only decrease taxes within an individual's marginal tax rate.
So an individual in the fifteen percent tax bracket would say fifteen cents for every marginal tax dollars ducted verses with a credit when you reduce liability by the full dollar.
This is great because it means that the people who are qualifying for these tax credits are getting more money off their taxes which they definitely need economically, and the government doesn't need as much.
Because recognize the kind of class of individuals we;re talking about when it comes to collecting taxes here.
We're not talking about the millionaires who when they avoid taxes literally take away thousands and thousands of dollars from the government.
We're talking about people who don't earn that much in the first place and the money that they provide via tax revenue is not even that high and certainly not so high that it makes up for the fact that this money is needed more by them than by the government.
Deductions just don't cover enough because they operate on percentages which leaves a fairly sizeable middle ground of people for who the percentage doesn't give enough but still are not well off enough.
It's analogous to the way that a lot of the middle class get screwed on college financial aid because they're too rich to qualify but to poor to pay for the college the way that they are asked to.
We think that the government needs to have a better way of adjusting to individual needs than they have in the status quo and we think that tax credits set us on that right path.
That it's better for the government to offer tax credits instead of deductions because of the way that they operate and because of the benefit that they provide to these people.
Because recognize it it's not like these tax credits just go to these people and then the money sits there and doesn't do anything.
Like this is money that then goes back into people's pockets and gets spent within the economy and leaves people feeling more comfortable and more secure which has all kinds of overflow economic benefits for the functioning of society as a whole.
Our second argument is about why it's a better mechanism than deductions.
First it is less confusing than tax deductions.
People can figure out if they meet the qualifications for tax credits rather than having to dig through different deductions and then not have a good idea of how much the deduction lowers their overall tax burden.
In the status quo the fact that deductions are in percentages often means that people can't tell how much money it's actually going to subtract from their overall.
But with tax credits it's a set dollar amount that people can much more easily do the math on at the end.
This also gives people a better idea more immediately.
With tax deductions you often have to wait until the very end when you received your money to figure out what your final tax burden looks like.
Tax credits are easier for one person to figure out themselves which allows people to plan more effectively.
It also allows the government to more effectively allocate niches.
It allows the government to set limits on how much money someone will have deducted from their overall tax burden which will then make it easier to allocate more credits into different niches without being worried about making someone's tax burden undeservedly light.
What we mean by this is that in the status quo there are often situations in which someone might qualify for a deduction but what happens then is because their overall income is still higher the government might not be so comfortable with having that deduction exist in the first place because it might benefit people who don't need that benefit in the same way.
But with tax credits because it's a set amount of money that gets subtracted at the end you're more comfortable supplying that to people because it's not a percentage that changes with the amount of money you earn, rather it's just at the end here's how much we subtract and so it's just an easier like the government doesn't feel like they're maybe losing more money off of it then they're earning when someone qualifies for a deduction but still makes a lot of money.
Proud to propose."
"National service in the united states should be mandatory.
National service builds character, capital, and generally bring societies together.
With that mind we would support the following model: that all individuals be required to serve for one year in the national service.
There will be a variety of options including the military or community engagement efforts, which will allow individuals to pick and choose what they would like to do in their year of national service.
There will also be deferrals for individuals with medical conditions or individuals with a time sensitive issue.
We believe that religious exemptions and other exemptions will be unnecessary, because individuals who are pacifists or who -wise have ethical obligations against violence can simply volunteer in a urban beautification project or to clean up national forests, and will still be serving their country.
Three arguments for why this is a good idea: first on the development of capital, second on the engagement of individuals and third on oversight in civil institutions.
So on development.
We believe that there are two forms of capital that we develop with this kind of policy: first is human capital.
Many individuals in the status quo do not have access to education or other forms of capital development.
May require a year or two on the job to truly become the most effective employees that they can be and to learn the basics of things like finance and the way the world actually works.
This is incredibly problematic.
We believe that the a system of national service will allow them to develop this kind of capital.
It will require them to be organized, healthy and generally work with the individuals that they have been assigned to.
By doing this we will guarantee that all individuals, rich and poor, have a similar access to this form of education.
Individuals will all be forced to serve this single year of national service, which will allow them to either propel themselves into college with better organizational skills or prevail themselves into a job.
They won't have to take a minimum wage job given that they will have a better understanding of our system and will have unique skills that they can apply to other forms of capital and labor.
Secondly, we think that it will develop land capital very effectively as well.
If individuals clean up parks, clean up streets, clean up areas overall, they will actually improve the profitability and efficiency of these areas as well.
If individuals understand they live in a cleaner area, if there's less crime, less danger, they'll be feel more safe and generally be willing to take more bold actions.
And we don't mean bold as in like running across the street without paying attention, but generally be more comfortable staying out late, investing in their community and to live a higher quality of life.
By doing this we'll improve the lot of all individuals in the national service and the individuals who live near these areas being developed.
My second argument is about community engagement.
We believe that national service will increase the amount of love for one's country that these individuals have.
They'll feel comfortable articulating this, they'll also understand the issues that currently exist in their country.
If you work in a national park for year you start to understand the issues with the lack of funding and the issues regarding wildlife conservation.
This'll allow them to have better political efficacy and pass considerably better policies.
Furthermore just having comradery with your fellow men, learning more about other citizens of your state will make you feel a greater obligation to them, which will further improve your community engagement.
My third argument is about oversight.
This is particularly important in the military.
And the status quo many individuals in the military come from poor families.
They do not have large amounts of political efficacy both because they do not have capital but also because they don't have the connections that are necessary to actually engage with these things.
We believe that if you put more higher education and higher wealth individuals into the national service, if they feel truly oppressed by the system or feel that the system is generally problematic, they will fight for better conditions.
They'll fight for better pay.
They'll fight for more autonomy in the military, increasing the lot of all poor individuals who feel like they have no choice but to go into the military.
For this reason, we should have national service in the US."
"Homebirth should be banned.
We think that the alternative to homebirth in this world in which homebirth this banned is that you would need to be you would need to give birth in a medical facility under the supervision of someone who is medically trained to give birth.
We recognize that this is a likely a financial burden on people and therefore we think that maybe you can give subsidies for this, but this isn't where that debate is going to be headed.
We're willing to take on the burden that this is going to place on people, because we think it is so important that homebirth does not happen.
So two reasons, two pretty similar but very important reasons why homebirth should be banned.
The first is for the safety of the child and the second is for the safety of the mother.
So on the child: during birth we think the safety of the child is clearly at risk if it is not handled properly.
There can be unexpected birth defects that need immediate care, there can be an instance in which an umbilical cord was wrapped around the neck or elsewhere of a child, and can cut off circulation, can stop that child from being able to breath, and it can be the case that the child when they come out of the womb, isn't breathing properly.
There are many many things that can go wrong.
Especially when there is no one trained in the area to take care of the child.
The child is the most important actor to consider in this round even if the cost of the doctors is high, because that life, because this decision can be life or death.
You need to consider this above all else.
The child did not choose to be born, the child did not choose the situation in which they are being born, but given that someone has chosen to bring this person into the world we think that it is owed to that person that that birth his handled with the utmost care.
This is the type of care that you cannot get with a homebirth.
We think the child is not able to make the decision of the homebirth and therefore it is fair on the government's part to regulate in order to ensure that adequate conditions anyone would consent to are being met.
Any child would want to consent, would be willing to consent into a world in which they're born in a hospital.
Born in a medical facility in which there are there's medical equipment nearby that can help that child stay alive if something goes wrong.
There's a trained doctor around that can help that child stay alive if something goes round, if something goes wrong.
None of that is guaranteed in the household.
None of that is guaranteed in a homebirth, which is why it can be so dangerous to the child.
Yes it's true, most of the time it goes okay, most of the time the child is born fine, but in those instances in which it is not it can literally cost that child their life.
And because of that, we think those instances outweigh all the instances in which things go right.
Secondly, the safety of the mother.
We think the right to life is the most important of all rights, and that the government has an obligation to override personal choice when personal choices putting one's life I dramatic risk.
So why is pregnancy and why is childbirth an obvious risk and very risky for the mother?
Well, you can have an instance in which the mother goes into prolonged labor and they are forced to suffer through an incredibly long period of contractions, and different types of problematic outcomes that can come from that prolonged labor.
There can be tearing and exponential bleeding during childbirth that need to be treated with surgery immediately after childbirth, and if that is not done, it can cost the mother their life.
And a lack of medical knowledge of those around can cause any number of infections or other types of negative externalities who arise after birth has been completed.
We think that the government has an obligation to protect the women giving birth in these instances even if it is against their wishes.
Because the government is obligated to protect life first and foremost above all else.
Given the fact that these are risky both for the child and the mother and that the government has an obligation to protect both actors, and a strong obligation to do so, homebirths should be banned."
"We should abolish no-knock warrants.
So when we say abolish, we would say that the state should never issue warrants that allow officers to enter a premises or enter a a space, without at least first alerting the people that they're coming in, getting permission or knocking on the door, trying to get permission to enter the to enter a facility peacefully.
Okay.
Two main points of constructive.
The first is that we would say that no-knock warrants violate the premise of presumption of innocence.
So we think that when you issue a no-knock warrant, there's an assumption in issuing such a warrant that firstly, the person that you're issuing it towards is dangerous, secondly, that the person is guilty, but if you don't get them in your confines quickly enough or if you don't get them with the massive amount of data that they may have at their disposal, that you won't be able to convict them.
This, firstly, is a violation of the individual's right to not give up information on themselves which we think is violated when people don't have the forewarning that individuals or that officers are going to break into their house.
But secondly, when you allow officers to break into a house with this assumption that individuals are dangerous, it ultimately represents a skew within the legal system that says that individuals that intersect with the legal system are ultimately guilty, and that there is a desire that these people and up with guilty because of the investment the state puts into the legal system.
We think that you can oftentimes or almost always get the information that you otherwise would have been able to by first knocking on the door.
Recognize that when you have a normal warrant, you can still get into the into the premises if the individual is at home or anything like this.
You just first have to notify them that you're about to enter.
This is the distinction, and we think that this distinction is important in preventing tragedies from occurring.
So recognize secondly, our second major point of constructive is that in the status quo, these things are used in incredibly disparaging ways toward already disenfranchised groups.
So, what oftentimes is the case is that these warrants are issued against minority groups and other types of situations in which there is an assumption ingrained in the legal system that these groups are guilty.
And what oftentimes or what occasionally is the case is that police officers will break into a home because of bad information or a bad lead that allows them to think that these people are dangerous criminals, when really it's just a family living in a house.
And they break in with with weaponry and with noise and causing fear within a community that their house can be invaded.
It's a signal from the government that any sort of home in these communities, at any time, can be invaded and broken into without just cause or without even a warning.
We think that this is problematic because it creates a massive divide between these communities and the state that is supposed to represent them.
We think that a no-knock warrant only serves to put fear into these communities in actuality, that that is the purpose it serves, aside from the principal purposes that defenders of this warrant may say.
So we think that given that the actual stance on the ground is that these warrants are used to create fear within these communities, this also oftentimes leads people to being in the wrong homes.
And what happens when people enter the wrong homes with a lot of weapons is that sometimes there is assumptions that people are guilty, and people can be seriously harmed because of bad information, because officers chose to barge into a home rather than trying to do the due diligence of treating the potential offender as a human being that can be interacted with in respectful manner.
We think that the criminal justice system already puts aside the rights of the defendant, the rights of the accused far more often than is worthwhile, far more often than is than is allowable within our rights framework.
We think that no-knock warrants are only extensions of that, and we think that they're used dramatically and disproportionately against marginalized groups.
Because of the bad signal it sends and the assumption of guilt that come with them, we should abolish no-knock warrants."
"We should legalize doping in sport.
We think that in the status quo, doping in sports is something that is a very common occurrence and that it's something that if you bring it into the light, if you allow it to be legally done, you're less likely to get a stigma created around it, you're less likely to get people to turn away from the sport, and you're more likely to get entertaining things for fans.
So when we say we would legalize doping, steroid use, different types of painkillers, all these things, they're fine.
Maybe you would still prohibit certain types of drugs but we think, in most instances, whatever athletes want to put into their body, that's their prerogative.
Okay, so why should we do this?
First, recognize that doping is just one of many enhancements that modern athletes have.
So it's not like this is nineteen twenty in which nutrition and chemistry and biology aren't so dramatically advanced and technology that doping is the only meaningful way for people to get an edge in a sport other than their, you know, innate athletic ability.
We think that in the status quo, there are a number of advanced dieticians, nutritionists, technology, such as bats that let you hit a ball further, such as helmets that make it less likely that you're going to get a a concussion, different shoes that let you jump faster and run harder, and all the things that people are able to have at their disposal during the training process that make their body more physically fit than it otherwise would have been without the aid of technology, and a number of therapies and rehabs.
None of these things are natural.
So none of these things provide the like innate athletic nature of the individual to come out.
They give enhancement to that person beyond what is biologically capable.
What this means is that we still we allow people to go beyond their natural capabilities all the time in sport, we just don't see it and they're not penalized for it.
We think that if you take away the penalty for doping, it would turn into much like these other things.
Like, if you get a steroid injection for a game, it'd be similar to getting some sort of injection for your rehab for allowing you to get back on the court, back on the field faster.
We think that these things are good in that it allows people to gain more from the sport.
We think that, furthermore, doping by itself just doesn't create a good athlete.
You still need technique, hours of training and hard work.
So, for example, just because barry bonds was able to take steroids, it doesn't mean that taking steroids allowed him to bat three fifty.
It doesn't mean that he was able to make better contact with a baseball, it just means that he was able to hit it a little bit further.
Oftentimes, people that become immensely good athletes, great athletes, because of doping were already very good athletes before they took steroids.
It just gives them a small edge.
We think that the stigma and the shadow of this doping the stigma in the status quo creates a shadow of doping over sports.
We think bans are shown to be ineffective time and time again when people continued to test positive, and people and the problem with this is that people become suspects, even without positive tests.
So people are stigmatized even if they don't dope when they're doing their sports, even if they aren't doping in their sport.
Which means that the penalty the the criminalization of doping in sport in the status quo only makes it more likely that people are stigmatized for these things, that there's only a greater shadow over a sport.
And given that, given that doping, as I've explained, is not meaningfully different from other types of biological or technological aids, we think you gains it removes the specter from doping.
We think you get simply a better product for the audience if people are running faster, hitting balls farther, doing these types of things better, that once you remove the stigma around it, once it is a legal thing to do, and once it's become normalized within the audience, you're more likely to put a product on the field or on the pitcher, whatever, that is better for the audience, that's going to bring more money in for the sport, and that is still going to require that individuals put in immense amounts of time training and forming their bodies.
It's not simply a fast track to success if you dope.
It gives you a little bit of an edge, but so do many other things that professional athletes have at their disposal.
Doping isn't meaningfully different, and for these reasons, we should legalize doping in sport."
"A global language is advantageous.
The english language has become the dominant language for business, law and other sort of transnational and global interactions that occur, whether it's the fact that tourists from america can go to places like europe and southeast asia without having to speak the language that occurs there because children are taught english at young age, or whether it be the language that business is done in at the corporate level across the globe, english has become the fundamental global language or lingua franca.
This is important to recognize, it's important to recognize that the reason that english has become this way, is not because english is the easiest language to learn, which it's not, or because english is somehow more efficient for giving away or for giving information between people than other languages, because it's not.
It's important to recognize the reason that english is the global language is because english, and specifically america, and england, have been dominant power houses in the globe for the last two hundred years.
This means that essentially imperialist forces have forced english upon the rest of the world because the power houses in business, in war, and other sort of globalized important factors, are forcing this language on other countries in order for those countries to be able to interact with markets in america, and be able to interact with leaders in america, for which for many places is an important source of aid, inferred diplomatic strength, and alliances and things of that nature.
This is important because, language isn't just the way that people communicate, but it's also a sign of their culture, there're important cultural distinctions that lie within language whether it's gendered pronouns that exist in many romantic languages, or the slang that people use in the way that they speak, or the way that certain information and certain customs are given through the languages we use.
When we have a language that's a global language rather than english, which is a language that is forced on individuals, we think that more cultures are able to have an input in how that language sounds and how that language is formed, which means those languages are able to stay relevant in the current society, and are able spread themselves across the globe much as english and american culture and ideology have been able to spread itself across the globe, which we really think equalizes the playing field to some extent that imperialism over the last two hundred three hundred years has cost within our world, which we think is important, because we think that the oppression that these countries have forced on to these other nations is wrong, it's something that has violated their the nation's ability to function as it sees fit and the people's ability to rule themselves.
And we think that a good way of stepping back from that regime, stepping back from that time, is to allow the way that we communicate with each other to be something that is as global as the world that we live in.
And we live in an increasingly globalized world.
Our businesses, our global interactions at the political level, our news interactions, our cultural interactions, we're sharing the music whether it's american popular music to the east or, or k or k pop and other asian pop music to the west and a number of other ways in which we share culture in a global community.
We think that that culture and those ideas are better spread when everyone has a better understanding of the language that we're communicating in.
Through translation much can get lost.
And we think that when you don't need to continue to translate things, rather you understand the language as it is been exposed or how's, how it has been expressed, we think that you're better able to spread ideas between these communities, and you lessen differences that may exist between those communities that comes from a lack of understanding.
I think that a lot of the hate that exist within the world, a lot of the xenophobia and misunderstanding that exists between communities, is a lack of ability to communicate with those communities in a meaningful and effective way, and this would be a way of undoing that sort of that sort of thing.
We also think that, aside from the cultural benefits that you get the spread of ideas, it's also beneficial in an economic sense.
If individuals are better able to communicate with those outside of their own country or culture or region, they're better able to spread their ideas, as well as their products, better able to ship and market those products when they have a better understanding of how to communicate with those along the supply chain, and what this means is that we get more economic proficiency and productivity not just in developed but also in developing nations when they're able to spread their products more easily across the globe, it equalizes the playing field so that you don't simply need a good education in order to learn multiple languages to function, but when everyone is speaking the same language, it means that all people start out with this basic ability to communicate with one another and to be treated with the respect and dignity that people deserve because there are no communication barriers that are left between individuals, because that better connects the world that is increasingly globalized anyway and allows for imperialist forces to be repealed, I think that global language is certainly advantageous."
"Global warming is a major threat.
No matter what some may say in the media the vast majority of scientists agreed that global warming is not a natural occurring phenomenon in the way that it's currently occurring, and that global warming is due to man-made carbon emissions and other pollution that has been going on since the industrial revolution.
There's a new spike in the global average temperature and every year new records are set that set the new high in regions all over the world and for the global temperature average generally.
So, global warming is a threat that we face and it is man-made so there is something we can do about it.
So why should we do something about it?
It's important to recognize that at the current pace of which we are emitting carbon dioxide and other harmful things like methane into our atmosphere, we are on pace to have to reach a global tipping point in which the amount of carbon in the atmosphere forms of greenhouse effect that cannot be undone for hundreds of years.
Something that will ensure that generations upon generations that follow us will be forced to deal with the impacts that I'm going to talk about right now.
There are a few major impacts of global warming that have serious and detrimental impacts on human life.
The first of those is that global warming means that global that polar ice caps are melting at an alarming rate and that global freezing occurs at lower rate during the winter, which means that normally there is now higher sea levels across the globe as well as more erratic weather patterns.
What do those things look like?
Well firstly, on a small scale in the status quo we can see that rising sea levels are causing populations to be harmed.
Islands in the pacific ocean that are habited are starting to sink entirely meaning that entire countries are going to be underwater in a number of years.
Forcing, in the status quo, small amounts of immigration and refugee problems but in the future, as water water levels continue to rise, even developed nations are going to be forced to deal with the fact that cities, major metropolitan areas are going to be underground.
And there are going to be massive immigrant and refugee crises that individuals and countries are going to need to deal with moving forward if we do nothing about this.
But furthermore it's important to recognize that once nations go underground and these metropolitan areas go underground, you lose massive historical and cultural landmarks that are tied to our human existence and to the identity that we feel as a collective humanity and that not only is there a loss of life and loss of property, but also a life a loss of history when we allow the sort of patterns to continue.
So, on top of the fact that cities are going to be under water on coastal areas, these global warming causes erratic problems with the weather generally.
Global warming, the name itself is somewhat misleading because it's not just the facts in the world is getting warmer but it's also the fact that weather patterns are getting more erratic, which is why you may have very warm temperatures come in the winter, but you get really strong storms coming in times when you wouldn't expect them, such as the spring and and things such as blizzards that mean that agricultural patterns are harmed in dramatic way which in developing nations can cause serious problems such as drought which means that many people simply aren't being fed and what we are seeing is that in those developing nations in particular, there is a massive increase in drought and a massive increase in famine that everyone is going to have to deal with.
This is another additional factor that could lead to those refugee crises that are already wrecking europe in the status quo and are only continue are only going to continue to cause political problems moving forward.
But these also have impacts on developed countries.
Blizzards, earth and more major storms such as tornadoes and hurricanes that rack the that rack developed nations as well such as the united states, still have massive detrimental impacts even with the infrastructure that these countries have in order to survive these storms.
This means that the worst of in society, both in developed and developing nations, are going to continually going to be harmed because in large part corporations, large agro businesses are causing these toxic waste to be poured into our atmosphere and into our waste, into our water supplies which is causing these harms to exist in the first place.
We think that it's reprehensible that society allows these things to happen these gains for the top to happen, when it causes global warming affects that not only impact those that are existing right now, the worst off in developed and developing nations but also because of the tipping point, are going to continue going to impact people for generations.
On top of the fact that pollution and warming causes impacts for the animal populations as well, causing mass extinctions of people or animal populations in the status quo that again, just like the tipping point cannot be reversed.
Given that our current trajectories going to lead to these impacts happening, it is almost guaranteed by science, we think that global warming is a major threat that must be dealt with immediately."
"The motion for today's debate is that the roman catholic church ought abandon the vow of celibacy.
What we mean by this is that currently when priests are not allowed to have sex for the entirety of their time serving the church, we think that this should be reneged and that priests ought be able to engage in unions with women, or men if your church is very liberal, and like be able to have children and sex etcetera.
So, two main areas of clash.
The first on how it alienates people from the religion.
Catholicism is a proselytizing religion, which means that they care about attracting new members.
The problem is that in the modern world we are growing into a less and less religious in part due to the arcane rules that seem arbitrary and obsolete to newer generations.
So currently many people are questioning the existence of a possible god do to factual evidence based in science, but they also dislike that religion places stipulations on their on the way that they can express themselves or who they might have sex with.
And so they tend to drift apart especially we see rising and rising rates of children born into religious families who leave those families and like stop being religious.
So we think that regulations on sex in the body are unattractive to the majority of the newer generation.
This decreases your new your new pool of members considerably and we think that it would be more compatible with the newer demographic for the church to maintain its relevancy by stopping these kinds of regulations.
But more than this we think that not only does it just like passively negate people wanting to join the church, we also think that it allows anti-religious groups to blame sexual misconduct of priests on their celibacy.
We think that with rising rates of pedophilia and like church cover-ups of pedophilia on the behalf of priests, a lot of other religious groups in competition for members have basically said that the reason that the catholic church is having these issues is because of the fact that they don't allow their priests to have sex.
We think when this happens this leads to generalized scandal, especially when the church seems like it is covering it up, that turn people away from the religion and actively make it seem like a barbaric and rude practice.
So we think that people don't want to join a religion that seems to take stances that lead to the harm of some of its members and then protecting from them.
So we think that in order to not give them that opening, to not say because you sexually stifle your priests they assault children, we think you should abandon the vow of celibacy there.
Our secondary of clash has to do with why it's counterproductive.
The purpose of the vow of celibacy in the beginning is that it is supposed to bring priests closer to god if they are not distracting themselves by having sex with women.
But we think that repressing these urges in the first place is far more distracting.
The the problem is that even though you can regulate physically what a priest does, it is very difficult to regulate what a person thinks about or what they feel.
And so we think that what happens on their side of the house is that even if priests are physically not allowed to touch other like touch others sexually, they can still think about these things and it still distracts them from their faith.
So we think that if this is something that is considered sinful, we think it is far safer to package them into a relationship.
Given that humans are going to have urges that they are likely to act on on both sides of the house, we think that it's preferable to funnel those urges into a safe outlet that doesn't involve like children or political thought that it might be an outlet of children but rather just putting people into relationships.
We also think that you get more appealing to the general populace if you are a family man or can relate to others who are in families.
We think it's really problematic when priests have no prior experience in relationships, but give relationship advice to those who come to them when they want to talk about divorces or whether or not to have children.
And so the only way you're actually going to have an efficient church in which priests are able to fulfill their duties, is one in which they're also allowed to maintain relationships that they want to.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"We should cancel pride parades.
In this round we're going to make three broad arguments about why we should cancel pride parades, but first what do we think this actually entails.
We don't think that this necessarily means that the government is going to ban pride parades, we think that this is more of a two worlds debate in which it would be preferable if pride parades did not happen, if they were cancelled.
With that in mind, three arguements.
First, pride parades are largely a target for violence against LGBTQ people.
What we mean by this is that in the status quo pride parades are a large event that is open to the public open to really anyone that wants to be there that fosters a community that is in the status quo largely marginalized and remember this isn't just something that occurs in liberals in liberal cities in developed countries but pride parades occur all over the developed and developing world and in many areas there are incredibly conservative individuals that simply view being an LGBT person as being an immoral person, as being a fundamentally sinful person and with that we think there are many instances and that this empirically does happen where pride parades become a target for violence and this happens in the developed world as well look at the violence that occurred in orlando a few years back following pride month and following pride parades in which many people were killed and injured in a shooting.
We think that these are things that cannot be allowed to occur and that yes while the expression of pride in oneself is something that is good there are other ways to celebrate this without having these large public events that ultimately put members of this LGBTQ LGBTQ group in extreme danger in many cases.
Secondly we think that these pride parades ultimately end up being shameful for those that are fearful to out themselves.
We think that outing yourself as gay is something that is an incredibly personal decision to make, that there are many contextual reasons why you as an individual may feel unsafe or insecure in expressing that part of your identity to those around you.
We think that pride parades are largely meant to include people that are out of the closet, people that are open about their sexual orientation, and we think that pride parades while they may be intended to be a celebration of all people that are in this LGBT group we think that in many cases for those that aren't out this feels like an expression of something that is wrong with them that it's bad that they aren't proud of who they are that they aren't open and out about who they are and that we think this puts one pressure on people to come out in instances when they really are not safe doing though aren't safe doing so and they probably should not for their own well being and two puts an immense amount of stress and and deeply upsets people that aren't going to come out because it makes them feel like they're fake in some way and they don't belong in this community.
We think that this community is preferable if it is open to all people that are amongst the marginalized group and so pride parades simply do not help that.
Finally we think these parades define find queer as a singular idea when pride parades actually occur the representation of gay and lesbian people generally come in a few types of stereotype.
There's the overtly sexual and hyper sexual a masculine man that comes out there are people that there are a number of a number of stereotypes that are portrayed in these pride parades and while largely it's people that are just being themselves, we think that it ultimately portrays in the media attention defines gay as defines queer as one or two types of people.
We don't think that people should be defined by their sexuality at all we think that all types of people can be gay, can be straight.
All types of people can fit the mold of being an LGBTQ person and that pride parades when they promote this one type of what it means to be queer, we think it makes other people question their sexuality, it makes other people feel excluded from this community, and it doesn't make it a more open and involved place.
Pride month and the idea of being proud of being a gay person is absolutely acceptable but the expression of it through pride parades is something that is unsafe and ultimately marginalized as many people within this community.
For these reasons we should cancel pride parades."
"We should adopt teacher tenure reform.
So in the status quo the way tenure works is largely that individuals that receive tenure have their job guaranteed unless they do something egregious that would void their contract things that go beyond being poor teachers to things that are downright illegal or actively harmful to student.
So we're going to reform teacher tenure in two ways.
Firstly, instead of a guaranteed lifelong contract or long term contract, you review tenured teachers once every five years so that their contract can be renewed on a five year basis, which means that theachers still have some stability in their workplace, they still some guarantee of job security, but it's not a lifelong guarantee and secondly, we would lower the bar for firing that currently exists so that if teachers are routinely shown to be ineffective, if students routinely show to be poor performers under these teachers they could be released from these contracts even if they have tenure and we think that obviously tenure exists in large part to attract people to a low paying job that is being a teacher so in order to make up for that we would also increase salaries for tenured and non-tenured teachers to attract more candidates to the field okay, so our primary argument in this debate is that education needs to prioritize student learning over everything else.
We think that the education system exists first and foremost to ensure that that society can create productive and knowledgeable citizens that can go on to make informed decisions and to be productive members of our economic system.
We think that tenure itself incentivizes teachers to be lazy.
Once a teacher in the status quo receives tenure, as long as they don't do anything to massively screw up, as long as they do anything that puts an undue burden on the school or onto students, they can essentially skate by and receive paycheck after paycheck without having to do anything to really improve students' lives.
And this results in long term harm for students because if students are subject to these teachers there are likely not going to learn the things that are necessary for them to be successful in the future and you can't just make these things up moving forward with the current school system continues to push you forward even if you haven't achieved the learning goals you're supposed to which means that there is a lifelong detriment for students moving forward.
We also think that tenured teachers make incredibly difficult to hire younger more innovative teachers which means teachers that are younger that otherwise could bring fresh blood into a school new ideas into a classroom and can really help students become more participatory and active learners in their day to day life are shut out by individuals that that receive tenure twenty or thirty years ago and continue to sit there doing the same old teaching patterns that have shown to be effective in the past simply because they have tenure.
We think that this is unacceptable because it means that not only are students being forced to learn from teachers that aren't enthusiastic about their job but they're also being denied the potential for fresh blood that could otherwise make it much easier for them to learn and to give them a new excitement about learning that ultimately could create lifelong learners which should be the goal of the school system.
Finally we would say that principally no job should have this sort of long term guarantee that tenure ensures.
We think that for all other professional jobs or for almost all other professional jobs, there's no similarity of tenure in other fields.
We don't think that people should be given a guaranteed contract simply because they have shown a short term level of performance that is that is acceptable.
We think that in most professional spear-spheres individuals are constantly earning their right to employment earning their job through showing the results of their labor.
We think that teachers being held to that same standard shouldn't be something that is unacceptable and it isn't something that is outrageous to request of our teachers.
Given the importance of education for our society and for our students we think that that type of priority that type of a system, one that prioritizes student learning is much more important than maintaining the tenure system that mostly just benefits long term teachers.
And for these reasons, we should adopt teacher tenure reform."
"We should support water privatization.
When we mean when we talk about water privatization what we mean is that sources of fresh water, resources for fresh water instead of being controlled by government actors we think should be leased out to private actors and be run by those private actors.
Now to be clear we're not saying that we should sell that water off to them to make it so that they can simply use it how they see fit, but rather the distribution of that water, the the way that the infrastructure exists in order to deliver that water to people, the upkeep for those systems, those types of things, all of the systemic needs for giving out water and the public good that is water, we think that we should lease those those facilities out.
We think that we should allow people to be able to make money off of those systems.
We should allow private actors to run that infrastructure and ensure those systems are effective.
So let's talk about the benefits of privatization.
The first is that it lower costs it lowers the cost to to provision water.
It lowers the cost of doing these types of things because if you have such a system when you're leasing out the ability to distribute water you can one, do this in a variety of different sections so that you can have different actors competing against each other for different for different tracks of water privatization, for different infrastructure areas and in this way you can create competition in the market which leads to various activities such as cutting out waste from the system in a comparative sense comparing it between a government run system in which your incentivized not to create low prices but rather to give jobs to people and as a politician make it seem like you are doing good for various members of the community as opposed to just delivering low cost inefficient manners and it also means that you have competition going against each other so that the profits that people are willing to accept get driven down and in all you have a system of lower costs for consumers.
It also means you've competition for higher quality and this is something that is incredibly important in today's day and age.
Many will say that you can just vote people out of office, that the government is directly responsible to the people and therefore they guarantee quality.
But this is simply not the case.
Even in developed countries such as the united states, you've many areas much like flint michigan, which is not the only area in which this occurs, in which governments have governments currently have massive amounts of neglect for these regions and because of that we think that as long as monopolies are broken up there are always alternative options for cleaner water.
As long as you don't give a monopoly on all water privatization in a region to one business, then you have an incentive outside of the care of the people in the region provide clean water because people can to shift their resources and shift their spending to a different business, to a different firm and additionally, this means that if there is a system in which one group is behaving poorly, we think the government is much more likely to take action and lash out and blame that private firm and find a new firm that can deliver higher quality than it is to accept the responsibility for the harm that it's caused such is the case in flint michigan in which people are still drinking dirty water after year after a year of exposure in this field.
And additionally on top of all this, a second argument we want to bring forward is that we think the government principally should be as small as possible.
We think that the government exists to provide protections for people's basic rights and exists as a way to ensure that laws are upheld but in every other aspect we think that there are private actors that can do the jobs that government actors are able to do.
In these respects such as running infrastructure in terms of water and the distribution of water, cleaning water making sure it's safe for consumption, these are things that private actors are perfectly capable of doing and because of that we think that private actors should be the ones that are allowed to do this.
Free people within the state should be able to in a free market form these relationships and start these businesses and have the ability to gain for themselves as opposed to letting the government control this, control the profits, and ultimately produce these things in a lower quality in a more wasteful way.
For these reasons, we should support water privatization."
"We should protect the antarctic continent.
In the status quo there already exist regulations that ensure that ownership of the antarctic continent cannot belong to one particular country or group of countries, and to ensure that drilling doesn't occur, that resource extraction doesn't occur, and that the ecosystems that exist in the antarctic are not tampered with.
We would ensure that all of those protections are upheld moving forward, if not strengthened to ensure that no private interests could private interests or countries could come in to try and use the resources that exist in the antarctic.
We think that the preservation of the antarctic is absolutely necessary.
So firstly, we're gonna talk about why the antarctic in particular is so important, and secondly, we're going to talk about about the bad pragmatic outcomes that would occur if you were to use resources from the antarctic.
So firstly, we think this is a particularly vulnerable ecosystem.
Unlike most ecosystems this one is not one that has interacted with industrialization or human kind, for the vast majority of its existence.
We've only been in the arctic circle at the antarctic continent for about a hundred years now, we don't develop in any way on the antarctic continent so there's no drilling operations are mining operations that exist, the animals are not attuned to dealing with people in the same way that animals are that live near urban areas or live in a continent that is developed generally, and we don't think that these ecosystems are tuned to the change that would occur because of human development.
We think that what's likely going to happen is that animal populations would start to die out because of the change in their environment that drilling and other types of production or industrial operation would cause, we think that ecosystems and natural mating grounds could be interrupted with , that for the vast majority for a vast majority of animals on the continent there would be negative impacts on them moving forward.
Their mating rituals, their living habitat, what have you.
And also more importantly, this is a particularly important zone the larger global implications that glacier melting and things like heating at the poles causes sea levels to rise which have massive implications on the world generally.
It leads to islands islands are being under, water cities are sinking, all these things have tremendous impact on the larger global level, and we think that of all the regions to try and tempt fate with, the antarctic is not the one.
But secondly, disregarding those things, I wanna talk about the pragmatic outcomes that would arise from the antarctic resource extraction, and why those are bad.
So firstly, firstly why we think it's bad.
So, we think that you're likely going to get more fossil fuels, oil, these types of coal-burning gases.
This is bad for a couple of reasons, first, it only perpetuates the cycle of harm that we're doing to our to our world right now, and secondly, it's not a very smart business move in the status quo to try and use fossil fuels because green technology is becoming ever more cheap, doesn't rely on expungable resources like oil and coal, these types of things, and we think that it's just a bad investment in the status quo whereas this money or these the the money that goes into resource extraction could go into to green technology development which is already becoming more and more profitable, second, on resource extraction such as rare earth minerals, we think that there are in the status quo other ways to get these minerals, for example astro mining is becoming a possibility, and these other examples with other options actually lead to more innovation and more resources being extracted in the long run, and we think that we should favor the long run approach in trying to do the more innovative thing rather than harming our ecosystem.
The final thing, the final thing is that there would be a massive legal problem if we weren't going to do this.
If we allowed countries or individual companies to exploit the antarctic continent, because in the status quo it is preserved by the fact that no country may lay claim to it, we think only what we would get is a massive legal battle.
That countries will be furious with each other over who was extracting the resources and why they weren't able to profit from these things, we think it would only lead to a tremendous amount of conflict which is why these protections exist in the first place.
Given that the pragmatic outcomes of what is going to occur is likely going to be detrimental in regards to energy usage, in regard of mineral usage and in legal require in legal regards, we simply think that the risk to the ecosystem is not worth it, and that we should protect the antarctic continent."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition at today's motion, that we should legalize the usage of cell phones while driving.
I've two independent points, but first an overview.
It's important to recognize that, autonomy is a right we have as individuals.
It's the most basic human right that exists, it's the reason why we value literally anything else, things like our right to life are only valued because we see the ability to do what we see best, and enjoy that life as the reason why we value it in the first place.
So it's important to recognize that, that when we're talking about government policy, we should try to defer to as little restriction on autonomy as possible, while still maintaining reasonability.
So with the two independent points: my first is that there are legitimate uses for cell phones while driving, and that those legitimate uses are something that we should allow people to engage in, and secondly is that there are reasonable forms of implementation that can ensure that we go about this, in a way that is both not particularly restrictive, but it also allows people to act in ways that they see fit, and maintain safety.
So on the first point of legitimate uses.
Things like emergencies, things like a call regarding child birth, or a death in the family, or something like that, these are legitimate instances, in which people need to receive information in a fast way.
And I think it's and then to recognize, that generally speaking, the way they are going to receive this information is going to be either through a phone call or a text.
This is the way that people communicate in the status quo, and this is just the way that that information will be conveyed.
So, there is a distinct benefit then to using the phone while driving.
That means that we there is a reward to be weighed, against the risk of an accident when a person is driving.
And that risk reward calculus has to be done by somebody, usually a government agency isn't going to be in a particularly strong position, and make that risk reward calculus, because they just don't know the details of the individual situation.
I think we should allow the driver to make that decision, because they are the best actor to weigh the risks and the rewards, they understand: a, the scope of the reward itself, but also the risk, because it's not like they don't internalize it, if the car crashes the driver also suffers, generally drivers are injured in catastrophic car crashes.
So it's important to recognize then that is totally reasonable to allow the individual driver to make that decision of whether or not, there is going to be they are willing to take this risk basically, in exchange for what could potentially be a very very significant reward.
A second independent point is that there are reasonable forms of implementation, that don't sacrifice safety, but do allow access to the benefits I've discussed already.
So, one example of this is hands free communication, that people can just sort of plug their phone into their car, and they just have to hit a button on the like console, in order to pick up the phone, and then they can just talking into the speaker phone.
This is something that isn't particularly distracting from driving in general, it's not any different really than having a conversation with someone sitting in your passenger seat that's next to you.
So given that, it's totally reasonable to allow people to do that, there really isn't a distinct harm, it's not going to be this massive incident of distracted driving, where you're going to have an serious uptake in road accidents.
So, we think that the government then should just defer to the least restrictive means of allowing a benefit to be internalized, that is ensuring that people can access this thing that is good, that is fast and efficient communication, while doing so in a way that doesn't create significant harm, that is through something like hands free technology, and legalization of using that.
So, there' it's very easy to have your cake and eat it too in this situation.
You can get that safe implementation, you can have these safe roads, but you can also ensure that people have the autonomy and the jurisdiction to actually make these decisions for themselves over, whether or not, they want that fast and efficient communication while they're driving.
So as a government philosophy, it's important to back this idea, that you're actually going to allow to citizens to make these decisions for themselves.
Proud to propose."
"Cycles of poverty begin at a very young age.
The refusal to provide poor children resources contributes hugely to their inability to get jobs, or otherwise increase their social standing, throughout their lives.
A huge reason, why there is stratification in our society, why wealth can be maintained in the most powerful individuals, is the fact that private education is incredibly prevalent.
Because we oppose this inherent inequality, we would say that private education should be banned in all western liberal democracies.
We believe that this is the only way around the use of private education, by wealthy individuals.
Recognize, that in every single state, wealth has the ability to get around laws.
The less severe a law, the easier it is to avoid it.
As such, we would say that banning is the only way to effectively enforce the will of the state, to get rid of a private education.
Two points of of substantive material to support this motion.
First, we believe that private education leads to educational stratification.
The wealthiest students go to private schools.
It is where they can create the most connections, where they are likely to get the best education, and because no individual wealthy student can create a change, whether they go to private or public schools, we believe that there's never an incentive to actually leave the private school system, because you're not creating effective social change, and you're simply short changing your child.
What this does is drain funds from public school.
Private schools move into an area, and crowd out public schools, by first creating wealthy tax areas.
When there's a private school, which serves a certain region, they're less likely to draw the public school within that region, because they don't want their tax money going to a school that their children are not going to themselves.
But additionally, if you do include a public school in a wealthy tax area, where most children from wealthy households are going to the private school, they're far more likely to vote for low taxes.
This means that public schools cannot flourish in these areas, and are far less likely to actually exist in wealthy areas.
Because property tax pays for public public school in the united states, and similar taxes pay for public school around the world, public schools lose a huge amount of resources, and poor kids get short changed.
The money when you decrease the amount of money going to a private school, and mix it in with the public school funds instead, the money will go much further.
Instead of buying another apple mac book for a student in a private school, that money is now paying for additional teachers, and smaller class sizes to teach everyone more effectively.
Very simply, this is not a zero sum game.
When you take the money for private school and put it in public school, the money goes considerably further.
But secondly, we think just on a societal level, increasing the funding to public school, at the cost of private school, is better for societal good.
We think that when you empower people in poverty, you empower the people who are less likely to be represented in the market, and less able to actually access capital, and as such are likely to get better products, more diverse products, more diverse work environments, and a better economy writ large.
Now, the second independent argument is that this inequality is inherently bad.
Even if decreasing the funding the public or private schools doesn't actually improve public schools at all, creating a level playing field is inherently good.
First, because people in poverty deserve this, as there's a reciprocal obligation to help them after they've been harmed in the past, or otherwise been unrepresented, in government, but secondly there's a fairness level to it, it's unclear why the lottery of birth should determine where individuals end up in life, so creating a level playing field is inherently good.
But the third reason why this inequality is inherently bad, is that this inequality will always reflect throughout their lives.
Wealthy individuals already have huge safety nets, but people in poverty have a hard time accessing things like college, or otherwise breaking the cycle of poverty, but creating equal playing fields, for all individuals, are a lot more provide people in poverty better opportunity of access to things like college, and jobs as well.
For this reason, we are so proud to support this motion.
Thank you."
"We should adopt mobile payments.
So, I think that what this debate comes down to is that it would be preferable to the status quo if there was much more access to paying for things with mobile phones or text, things like that.
So, we see that this is already getting more popular in developing and developed countries, but we would like to see basically every business accept mobile payments in in place of cash and credit.
So, two big arguments for you.
The first is about why this would improve access to financial services.
We're going to talk about the, so called, unbanked people.
These are people who maybe they live in a developing country and they don't have access to a local bank branch, there's no, you know, whatever their version of bank of america or chases in their town or their village or their neighborhood, so these people have no way to access financial services.
They have no way to get personal credit, which makes it very difficult for them to start a business or make a large purchase, because, you know, there is if there is no bank you can't get a credit card or you can't get a personal loan, and on top of that they have no way to protect their personal wealth.
When you have a society that operates purely on cash, your money is always greatly at risk.
I was talking to a friend who lives in south africa, and he was explaining to me that people who live in these unbanked areas in south africa, these towns built near major cities, where a lot of people are very low income and there's a lot of crime, people get paid on the first through fifteenth of the month, and thieves will wait near the businesses where people work and attack them and take their paycheck, because it's all in cash.
So people feel like they have to hide their money or leave it with their employer, which means that their employer has a lot of leverage over them.
People don't think about saving money because if you keep it in your house, a thief might break into your house and take all of your wealth.
So there's no incentive to save and there's very little ability for people to actually use their money in the most effective way, they feel like they have to spend it all at once right away, and they're taken advantage of by businesses who know that this is the case.
How does this change as a result of mobile payments?
So sure, somebody can steal your cell phone, but that's very different than them stealing your wallet, because your mobile payment account you can put a freeze on it, you can otherwise take steps to prevent fraud and theft, it's regulated much more like credit cards are, than cash which is impossible to regulate.
So now people who live in these communities, like these little towns near major cities in south africa, have the ability to save, they can start a savings account using these mobile payments and put money into it even if they can never go to a bank in their whole life, they can still take advantage of a way to save for their old age and to protect themselves from emergencies.
They can access credit, because once you have a savings built up, you have something to borrow against, so we think it's more likely that they'll be able to do things like purchase a home or a piece of land or put their children through school using credit.
And we see also that there are less likely to be victims of theft and fraud, and ultimately because of that we think that this is going to be really valuable for people who are suffering in the status quo because of a lack of access to financial services.
Our second argument is about how this uniquely helps development.
So think about a country like the philippines, that's very reliant on remittances.
There's millions of filipinos living in america who send money back to the philippines every month.
Now, right now in order for this to work, people have to go to a western union or a bank in order to collect those remittances.
The country's economy is growing a lot, but only because people are able to invest and build up capital from remittances.
But what happens for those people who live in a a not so good area near manila, who don't have access to banking?
They can't take advantage of this remittance based system.
Maybe their relative can come back and visit and bring the money, maybe they can get cash from somebody, but then all of the harms I already explained to you follow through.
So we think that in terms of spreading development to the poorest areas of a developing country, it is much easier with mobile payments, because remittances can be sent instantly over the phone.
If someone has a medical emergency, their cousin in america can send them some money right away, things like that.
So, because it increases access to financial services and because it helps spread development, we should adopt mobile payments.
Thank you."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of today's motion, that we should abolish affirmative action.
I think the definition of affirmative action is pretty straightforward, in that this is programs that, either in universities or corporations or whatever, promote people who are of historically oppressed classes in the united states.
Maybe this is like affirmative action program for like women in hiring, for like african americans, so on so forth, in generally, most like racial minorities this will probably apply to.
So, three independent points on this.
First, that there are often places people who are unqualified for the position, in a way that hurts both the institution at which they hired, and the person who is being the recipient of the affirmative action.
Second, that it distracts from more politically salient solutions to systemic inequality, and thirdly, the backlash that it generates.
On the first independent point, regarding lack of qualifications.
So we think that, generally speaking, these are going to be people who are put into these positions, that are comparatively less qualified than others, this is almost inherently true, given that if they were equally qualified, or more qualified, they would probably be higher to the traditional process.
I think there instances of hiring discrimination, that might like chew away the edges of this for them, but for the most part, like blatant hiring discrimination is something that can be legally prosecuted.
So, how does this harm individuals involved in the process then?
So first, at the corporate or university level, it harms them insofar as they have applicants at their doors, that are just like less qualified, less capable of doing their jobs.
That creates inefficiencies within the corporation.
But secondly, it harms the beneficiary three ways: first, on campus discrimination.
Things like hate crimes are more frequent for people that are beneficiaries of affirmative action, insofar as the narrative surrounding their acceptance is that they did not deserve it.
That in turn leads to a lot of discrimination, that would not occur in the world where they did not receive that affirmative action, and in return, means more suffering.
Second is the financial burden it places on these individuals, that, again when we're talking about universities, tuition is often quite high at the more prestigious universities, that affirmative action would generally have to apply to, because generally speaking, like state, universities don't have to worry about meeting these types of quotas.
And third, the high dropout rate, or firing rate in terms of corporations, means that generally the so called benefits of these programs aren't even actualized, right?
Like a lot of like, like a recipients of affirmative action are disproportionately more likely to drop out, specifically because they did not receive like the quality of early education, that was necessary to make them capable of the course load and the work burden, that is intrinsic to the place that they end up going.
So, as a result of that that they are much more likely to drop out.
So, second independent point is that it distracts from reforming primary school education, from like a political standpoint.
So in america, the black white testing gap, that is like the testing gap that exists between like african americans and white children, is something that originates around second grade, that is to say in like kindergarten and first grade generally, when you test people, there is like no statistically significant difference based on race.
As you get older however, that gap begins to widen, because a disproportionate accesses to access to resources like tutors, and other things that are generally financially motivated, but also somewhat intrinsic to like the way in which like we value like schools in like historically black neighborhoods, and things like that.
That's a problem that is a that is like actually possible to tackle, right?
Because when we just sort of take these children, who are historically disadvantaged by their primary education, and shove them into colleges expecting that to be the fix all, that doesn't work right?
Like we need to address these things in the most basic level, and when you have affirmative action programs that are satiating the liberals who support them, you generally don't get the more important reform at the basic level, that actually creates the problem in the first place.
Third independent point is backlash, that generally this is a galvanizing issue for like, far right groups, and like especially groups that are motivated by racial hatred.
We think that, generally, this is a bad thing, because this is something that is extremely easy to demonize, and so far it is like externally just like looks like an unfair thing to do, and as a result of that, we think there are like exogenous harms that come from this, as a result of the fact that you are driving people to engage in hateful politics, because you are giving them like, this easy thing to straw man.
Proud to propose."
"We should limit the use of birth control.
In this round we want to make our model clear.
We think that as a society we should try to abstain from using birth control of all forms whether it's the pill, whether it's a condom, whether it's other types of birth control all acts, all types.
We want to limit access legally to those who are over eighteen unless they have the permission of their parent to have birth control and we think it would be better as a general norm that people did not use birth control as frequently.
So this may sound counterintuitive, but we're going to make two broad arguments.
The first is that you have a less sexualized culture and we're going to explain why that's better, and second, we're going to talk about more parental control.
So we think generally this motion is largely impacting those that are of younger ages because when people are older they have the ability to make these choices largely for themselves because of the way we've set up the model but we think that young people today growing up are growing up in a hyper-sexual culture one in which there's huge pressures to have sex.
We think it's very difficult to internalize the emotional impact of that action as a young person.
Many people who are growing up in this culture don't understand that being in a sexual relationship, being vulnerable in that sexual relationship, having a healthy sexual relationship, how difficult these things are and how they can be emotionally and mentally draining and how in bad scenarios people can end up in really bad emotional and mental states.
We think it's better to check against the potential of long term long term sexual emotional issues and suspend that pressure as much as possible.
By limiting the access to birth control, we think you deter the amount of people that are ultimately going to try and have sex.
We think that when you have fewer people having sex, you end up having a less sexualized culture because if fewer people are sexually active, that's fewer people in places like high schools, in places like in extracurriculars that young people are involved, we think that they're less likely to be talking about their sexual relationships to be putting implicit pressure on others to be involved in a sexual relationship because simply there's going to be fewer people that can have safe sex.
Some may say that this is going to lead to more unprotected sex but we think that in the status quo, there are already plenty of people that have that and there's plenty deterrence against that because because of the impacts of a potential unwanted pregnancy.
So we think that you're more likely to have a larger decrease in people that are creating the sexualized culture than you are people resulting in unwanted pregnancies.
Secondly more parental control.
We think that parents are the most informed people about their children.
They almost always have the best interest of their child in mind because of that close connection that one has as a parent to a child.
Parents know if their children are ready for a sexual relationship and we think legally limiting the use of birth control to people that are over eighteen is preferable because it means that you're setting this bar at which people generally are able to make safe choices, are able to make responsible choices but below that age, we think it's questionable whether someone really is able to consent into a sexual relationship, to fully understand what that means.
But parents are those that are probably most likely to understand whether or not a child is ready for that and while it may be difficult to talk to your parents about sex, we think it's better to be doing that than to try and run around behind one's parent's back and make decisions that a person is going to regret in the future.
There's no clear right to birth control.
There's no clear right to have as much protected sex you want.
But we think what parents do have is a right to raise their child in the way that they see fit, to raise their child with a moral with a moral life and a moral upbringing in the way that they see best and for these reasons, we should limit the use of birth control."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban private education.
Two main areas of clash: first, on why there isn't actually a right to a better private education for an individual.
Having a private education usually means that your parents are very wealthy and are willing to put you into a more intensive and personalized education because they have the money to do so.
Recognize that given the means, every parent would choose to put their children into a better school.
The only thing that happens in the status quo is that this choice is only accessible to those who have more money than others, because there is a monetary barrier to putting your child into a private school.
We don't think this is fair though, because there's literally nothing that makes someone from a richer family more worthy of a better education than someone who is poorer.
The amount of money that parents earn is, first, arbitrary, and often predetermined by the conditions in which those parents were raised, the educational opportunities that were available to them, and the job opportunities that followed.
But also, even if you don't buy that that is arbitrary, is definitely out of the power of the child who is most affected by that parent's financial status when it comes to their education.
So, it we think that maybe there's an argument in a world where parents are putting themselves into private education based on the money that they earned, but that child didn't earn that money, they just happened to be born into a richer family.
This is definitely arbitrary and definitely should not determine the rest of your life in the way that it often does.
As such, they shouldn't be separated, especially since high school education often sets you up for the future.
Like if I'm going to have a good math background in high school, it means I'm much more likely to be able to go into stem fields in the future, and it's unfair, we think, that people with private educations, who have more money, should uniquely be able to access that better future or that better background.
Like getting good grades, getting the right references, all of this is infinitely more accessible to someone in a private school, and we don't think that this is fair at all, especially at the point that it oftentimes defines the entirely like the entirety of the rest of your life.
Like if because I want to a crappy high school, I didn't make it into college, this or I didn't have like good enough teachers to deal with me, then in the future, I'm not going to be able to function as well as I potentially could.
And in the end, we think that all this debate is about is whether or not children should get an equal chance at success.
We think they should, and we've already won the round on that.
But our second area of clash is why we think that it actually makes the public school system better for more people when you put those who would have been in private schools into the public school system.
Because recognize that richer parents are usually those who can afford to put money into those schools.
They're willing to call the school repeatedly to make sure that their child is being treated correctly or taking the right classes.
A lot of the time, they're parents that have one or more people who is has more time on their hands and can volunteer at that school.
They're going to actually require things like extra curriculars and class resources, and because they have the money to back it up, the school is much more likely to listen to them.
And so we think what actually happens on their side on our side of the house is that when you have these students going into these public schools, the money that their parents have comes with them.
And so you're actually going to have better public schools because they're forced to live up to a standard.
They can't just ignore their students and their parents because they don't have any money to put behind it or because they don't have the time to come in, because now there're richer parents who are willing to make things better for everyone as long as it especially makes things better for their child.
And so in the end, we think that it's actually much better because, at least now, because of these richer kids there, your school's going to be able to afford to have more extracurriculars, and it's going to be better because they don't want their kids to be in bad schools.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should legalize insider trading.
Two main areas of clash, but first, an overview, because I want to talk about what a crime is.
We think that, a lot of the time, things are criminalized for one of two reasons: either a, there are harms to the individual, these are instances of paternalism, or two, it is because this has massive external impacts and harms others.
Obviously, insider trading doesn't do harm to the individual, and it's criminalized because of supposed harms to other people.
But, the problem with this is that, even those arguments that say it harms the average consumer of the stock market are wrong.
They are presupposed on the idea that individual insiders can change the the initial minds of consumers.
But, if I was going to buy a stock, I was going to buy it either way.
The difference on our side of the house is that I am likely to buy that stock for cheaper, because I can buy it from an insider who knows their corporation is going down.
On their side of the house, I'm still going to buy the same stock, because presumably I made my mind up before hand, but it's going to be much more expensive, and inflated by the market.
At the point that, insider trading is a crime without a victim, we don't think you can criminalize it.
Two many areas of clash now: the first on why speculative markets are generally bad.
We think the issue of speculative markets is that, they are massively driven by arbitrary factors, rather than the actual value of the corporation, and the true value of the stocks.
A really great example is pets dot com, because, even though this website had no actual value, people were investing massive amounts of money into it, simply because the title of it suggested that, it should be something that was worth a lot.
It had a very desirable URL.
If someone with insider like through insider trading could say: look, pets dot com is trash, do not buy their stock, we think the crash that later happened, not just at pets dot com, but many dot coms, because of arbitrary like buying of stock, would not have happened.
We think the issue right now is that bubbles are allowed to gather, because people are buying up stock, based on the name of the site, or who bought it previously.
We think that, if microsoft was going to buy up a corporation right now, the corporation stock would drive up, just because microsoft bought it, even if even if microsoft bought a dying corpse.
We think the preferable system is one, in which you don't just do things because like you're speculating about them, but rather have real information for doing it.
But more than this, we think that general bloat reaffirms pre existing companies, and clogs innovation.
The fact that, just because microsoft can put their name on something drives up the price of a stock in that corporation, means that you reinforce monopolies, and reinforcing people's minds that, these are the corporations that ought be invested in in the future.
Cool, second area of clash is on why markets are benefited by by efficiency.
We think that, insider information, and following those patterns, means that bad stuff doesn't get invested in, and people don't lose the same kind of money on our side of the house.
We think that when you get good information, because, recognize that the information we get on our side is good, there's a market incentive to be trustworthy and honest, and in the end, even if the fact that your investors just won't invest with you anymore, doesn't motivate you, the fact that you can get charged with frauds will.
We think that what this means is that, you're actually going to keep things at their true value, because insiders will just say: this is what the stock is worth, this is what I am willing to pay for it, and you can follow the patterns of how they're investing, in their corporations.
We think this also evens out volatility, at the point that people can look at the trend of what the people actually running the corporation are doing, and stockbrokers themselves, they are less likely to have flight responses, based on arbitrary motions, and more likely to actually pay attention to patterns.
We think, this also just benefits market participants, right?
At the point that stocks aren't arbitrarily inflated, you are more likely to be able to buy more of the stock that you want, or be able to hone in on what you desire.
So, if you're going to spend a lot of money, you're going to know that it was actually worth it, and if you want to buy something that is of lower worth, then you can actually hone in on those things much better.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should adopt direct democracy.
So the model that we're gonna be putting forward in this motion is that we think that, for simplicity's sake, we're probably going to allow that the legislature can continue to exist as a body that exists solely to draft laws and that bureaucracy, those types of structures, are still going to exist in order to fulfill those laws, but that when it comes to voting on legislature that is going to be enacted on any sort of level of federal or state or local level, all votes would be taken in the form of direct democracy, so all voting eligible individuals would have the chance or the opportunity to vote in such elections.
Okay.
So the general principle that we're going to put forward is that direct democracy is a a form of democracy in which you can do more good for the people and that you essentially get better outcomes.
So, firstly, we would say that the good is determined by the people.
We don't think that there's any sort of objective understanding of what is good for society or what needs to be put forward by a state.
We think that the understanding of what is good is determined by what the community needs and, essentially, can only be discovered within the community.
We think that the state as a body is almost always a course of entity in the sense that individuals have very little opportunity to consent into that state, to choose which state they're going to be a part of, things like this.
They're often forced into the state by their circumstances or the lottery of the birth and therefore, the state needs to be very respectful of the good, as determined by the community, in order for that state to be just.
Otherwise, it simply acts as a cartel that has control over a body of people.
So, we think that direct democracy allows for people to implement laws that they see fit.
We think that when direct democracy takes place, the other types of interests, the private, specialized interests that end up becoming involved in the legislatures that we see in western liberal democracies all across the world, we think that those things end up being drowned out.
Because the lobbying firms that allow for private interest have such immense power over legislators in the status quo, we think that type of lobbying power simply wouldn't exist on such a diversified and indirect way that it would be able to impact a system of direct democracy.
And we think that people are going to be more likely to want to participate in this type of system.
Because in the status quo, people feel like their votes have very little impact, not just because they're one marginal part of an entire electoral system, but also because they know that representatives oftentimes don't fulfill the promises they put forward.
They don't fulfill the things that they say they're going to do.
They end up changing their opinions whether it's because of new information they get or because of lobbying and specialized interests impacting how they choose to vote because they need to raise funds for their campaigns, things like this.
We think that these types of special interests that skew voting so that legislature ends up passing that simply isn't supported by the vast majority of a constituency.
And we can see things like this all the time in how current legislator current legislation that exists within the united states, for example, legislation about the criminalization of drugs, legislation about laws against bathroom use for transgender individuals.
These are unpopular laws amongst the populace, but but these laws continue to be in power and continue to be in play because of the special interests that that control them.
So we also think that you're ultimately going to get better outcomes when you switch to a system direct democracy, because not only do you allow the people that have the most vested interest in the laws, the average person, to have a voting say in which laws are going to be there that constrain them, the laws that are going to have control over them, we think that people now know that they have more of an impact on the democratic system, they have more of an impact on the state and the state laws they control them, and we think people are more likely to participate in this type of system, and we think you're less likely to get laws that go against the will of the people.
And because of these reasons, we should adopt direct democracy."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should disband the united nations.
Two main areas of clash, the first on how it doesn't work.
The united nations was created in a time, when people were scared of globalization.
They wanted states to stick to themselves, and be as minimal an interference as possible.
This is why the permanent five were given the veto, and why the united nations is often tending to to not do something rather than take action.
As such, it is incredibly outdated.
The security council creates an unfair power disbalance, that makes it so that nothing ever gets done, that might be against the desires of the permanent five, so real change can never occur.
It allows the permanent five to maintain this power over other nations, in in like in case another nation want something done, or use it as a punishment, should one nation disappoint them, and and and it prevents actual change from occurring, by making everything into a political discussion, rather than recognizing what action has to be taken.
It is a problem that the only determinant thing that the united nations has done unanimously is israel year after year, and it is even more of a problem that this, barely occurs due to vetoes as well.
But even in the theoretical way, the united nations is too big to be efficient, insofar as almost every nation is included, there is never a world in which they are going to agree on something in particular.
There's always going to be a minority disappointed.
Moreover, it neglects the voices of those more involved.
We think that the african union is more likely to know, about what is best for africa, and thus it should not be the decision of the united states or china, if something actually gets done in that area.
Because the resources are funneled into the united nations, you never get these competitors coming up though, and you never get things like the african union taking the actions it needs to take.
We think that it only promotes tension, because because countries can never agree and the existence of something useless, masquerading as good, is worse than if nothing existed at all.
Because it means that there is a false sense of solvency, that allows nations to say: but look, we're communicating, we are doing something, when nothing is actually changing.
Our second of clash has to do with how it how the united nation crowds out alternatives, that could actually make change on a on a wider scale.
Groups like nato, the african union, the european union, or the organization of american states, are all viable alternatives created to deal with issues of humanitarian aid, and human rights abuses.
We think that the smaller groups are on net preferable, because they're less bureaucratic, and you don't have a permanent veto, that says: even if the majority agree, like we're still not going to do it.
We think that the smaller groups would allow for more directed treatment, as said as said previously, the african union probably knows better what africa needs, than every other voice crowding out african nations within the UN.
We think it's a problem that the UN still operates under incredibly imperialist norms, where it doesn't matter if you know the conflict better, all that matters is that you have more money funneling into that group, and have a louder voice, as such.
Moreover, we think that it promotes this kind of imperialism, when it forces smaller nations, at the behest of of larger nations.
When the only way to get your proposal ahead is to negotiate with china, or the united states, essentially allowing them free reign over things, like resource extraction, if you really want something done, or when you're afraid to make them angry, because then they will not help you in the future.
We think it prevents actual change from occurring, because smaller nations cannot do what is best for them, rather having to defer to what larger nations want.
We think the only way to end this imperialism is by destroying the system, and seeing what else comes in its wake.
Negotiations will occur regardless, because countries need to talk about things like trade, and to talk about humanitarian aid, et cetera.
Like, the only difference now is that we're not doing so, in a way that doesn't work.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should subsidize higher education.
We believe that there is a right to education that can only be fulfilled by not only allowing for primary education but also for free university and secondary education for all.
We think that this right exist for a couple of reasons: the most important reason that this right exists is because of what the obligation to state are to the people and why the state exist generally in the first place.
We think that the state exist in order to provide for equal access to opportunity for its citizens.
Individuals are born into the circumstances that are outside of their control, meaning that random chance determines many factors that will place them and determine what opportunities they have such as the money that their family has that they're born into, their race, their gender, and other such factors that impede them in both the way that people treat them through biases but also through just the ability that they have to get a good education, good tutoring, access to jobs, things of the like.
So what do we think a free secondary education does?
Free secondary education allows for all people to have access not just to low paying service sector jobs but also to higher paying specialized jobs such as those in growing tech industries, in medical industries, legal industries, things that allow individuals to exceed what their ordinary circumstances would have allowed.
Because many people have the ability to be educated many people do well in high school and primary education but don't have the opportunity to go further because they don't have the means to pay for that and while colleges to subsidize individuals we think that this isn't enough to ensure that the most people can go and it simply doesn't do enough level playing for as the state is obliged to do.
Further, even if even if you don't believe that there's a right to education per se at this level, we think that there's no meaningful distinction between the delineation we make between the education we give to elementary primary and secondary education and that education that you would achieve from a university.
There's no major distinction between the educational barriers or the educational benefits that come between these two parts, except that there's a greater benefit the more educated one is, because of the job opportunities available to them.
Given that this is the case, we don't think there's any reasonable distinction to be drawn between the two and if we believe as we do in a society that does fund these types of education, that you should fund primary and secondary education, there's no meaningful reason why you ought not continue to fund , university education.
Furthermore, there's an important benefit to society that comes from these things and namely that when you allow people to exceed what their expectations would be otherwise you break cycles of poverty that are incredibly costly to the state.
People that live in these impoverished situations benefit from state welfare programs for a long period of time, which is a major expenditure for states that would be avoided if more individuals were able to break out of the cycle of poverty that are dictated by their circumstances when they're born.
Given that higher education allows you to get off of things like food stamps programs, medic-aid programs, free health and social service programs, we think that the state in the long run will save money by investing money now into people's futures so that they can build for themselves the lives tey want.
Also, why do we think that this is going to be an affordable program?
So we think that there are many ways of doing this in which you can be more affordable than simply paying for every single person to go to high-school or go to college.
We think that there are ways to ensure that when people can afford to pay they do pay so that they subsidize other individuals, but that for, say, state universities that education is made free to anyone, or the amount of money that they can feasibly pay is the only amount of money that they need to pay so that all need is met by the state universities in in essence subsidizing these things to a great extent.
You can also make state universities free and provide for these money, for these institutions through money that's spent in other ways such as money that goes to these, social welfare services and things like that, especially because in the long run those services are going to be less costly to the state.
So may cost a little bit of money in the in the current term, you may have to take on deficits but that's worth in the long run.
You can also subsidize these schools up front in a way that's called pay it forward, where individuals are able to go to university for free and for a certain amount of years after they graduate pay a certain percentage of their income, maybe ten percent of their income each month, to the university that they went to so that they never have to take on a debt burden that they can't afford, they never take on massive student loans to go to university and they can go to the university of their choosing without having to pay money in the instances where they have no job, they have no disposable income, they're the least able to pay for their college university experience.
And they can go on to the future and actually get proper value based on how much money that degree served them.
And for these reasons we think that we should subsidize college education."
"We should ban homeopathy.
So just so that we're all clear what we're talking about, by homeopathy we don't mean all alternative medicines.
We're talking specifically about a belief that if you dilute a substance that its essence somehow becomes stronger in the water.
So, for instance, if you wanted to use antimony in a homeopathic remedy, you would have one part per million of antimony in the water and then dilute it even more till it was one part per billion, and then dilute it even more until there was no antimony whatsoever in the water that people are actually purchasing, but the homeopath believes or claims that some essence of the antimony is left behind in the water, and they could do this with any other chemical or substance as well.
So, three arguments for why we should ban homeopathy.
The first is a standard for when we think government should paternalize, intervene and prevent people from taking some action.
First: if there's a third-party harm, then we think that, obviously, the government should get involved.
Everyone is okay with people banning smoking because of the harms of secondhand smoke.
We're okay with requiring people to make their children wear seat belts because of the harm to the child if they don't so this.
We think that, broadly speaking, homeopathy works in a similar way.
The people who do debate, a lot of healthy young college students, might not be at a lot of risk from homeopathy because if one of us gets pneumonia, we're young, we're healthy.
Our body will probably just fight it off, even if we're just taking expensive water, rather than real medicine.
But for the elderly or for children, this is very, very, very different.
If you have a parent who were to give their young child a homeopathic remedy when they had bronchitis or pneumonia or some other relatively serious, but not usually life-threatening illness, that child runs a much greater risk of being harmed as a result of this homeopathic treatment, because the body of a young child is not as well able to fight off the illness as a healthy young adult.
The same thing is true for the elderly, who may be misled by a caretaker into taking some homeopathic remedy that actually does nothing for them, and they run the risk of developing a much more serious illness.
The second time when we'd say the state can paternalize is when there is an asymmetry of access to information, and this is certainly true for homeopathy.
Recognize that it's not a bunch of, you know, hippies and grandmas whipping up these remedies in their kitchen to help out their kids.
It is major companies that sell homeopathic drugs nationally and internationally.
It's a big business and these companies know full well that homeopathy doesn't work, because all the scientific research points to that.
So what they do is they mislead their customers into thinking that they'll get care.
They put things on their boxes like treatment for pneumonia or treatment for cold, even though there's no treatment for the common cold, even though this doesn't do anything to cure pneumonia.
And, ultimately, we think that people are being misled and that the government should intervene: one, to protect third parties and two, to protect people from misinformation.
Our second argument is that we think this would encourage more development of real medicine.
Why is this true?
If people spent more money on real medicine than they do right now because they weren't buying homeopathic medicines, then it stands to reason that there would be an even greater incentive to develop cures for the types of illnesses people tend to use homeopathy for, things like the flu, the cold, etcetera.
We think, ultimately, even if this is small, it's still better on our side.
Our third argument is that we think that you should punish the companies that produce homeopathic drugs.
These companies for hundreds of, not hundreds of years but for decades, close to a hundred years, these companies have gotten away with selling sugar water to people who can't really afford it in order to trick them into thinking that they're receiving a cure, but really to profit, because there's virtually no expense to producing homeopathic drugs.
At the end of the day, we think that these companies deserve to lose their investment because they've acted unethically by misleading their customers.
If anything, we would be okay with going after them and prosecuting them for misrepresentation in advertising, but at the very least, we should ban their income stream.
For these reasons, I'm proud to encourage that we should ban homeopathy.
Thank you."
"Slum tourism does more harm than good.
So by slum tourism, we mean the act where people from a rich area or a rich country go to a poor area or a poor country in order to see the people who live in poverty.
So this might look like americans visiting a favela in brazil, or like europeans visiting the huge shanty towns outside of paris for instance.
So we have three main arguments for why we think this is bad.
First, we think that slum tourism is dehumanizing.
The people who live in the shanty towns and favelas are people too and they deserve to be treated with respect and compassion by their fellow man.
We think that going and treating these people as zoo animals by visiting their homes in order to point and look at them and gawk, is not showing a lot of respect.
These people have to live in this area so they can't just choose to leave if this bothers them, and ultimately we think it's likely that many people will feel like there's no point in speaking up because no one cares what they think, but will be uncomfortable with the idea that they're being gawked at, and seen as so other by other people.
We think that by putting these people on display you deny their humanity because we wouldn't do this to middle income people for instance, and ultimately that it's unacceptable to do all this without the consent of the people who live in these areas, and we think that very rarely is their consent actually sought, or meaningfully given before the slum tourism goes into place.
Secondly, we think that this comodifies poverty.
By that we mean this makes the poverty of favelas or shantytowns a product to sell.
Why is this so problematic?
So, recognize that if there's a demand for poverty, that if there is a body of people in america and europe who want to go on this slum tourism, then there has to be a supply of it to meet that demand.
So what this means is now there is a financial incentive for some large travel companies and governments to keep people in poverty, to maintain shocking displays that wouldn't take place where these people who are visiting would come from.
In other words, now suddenly it's a strategic business decision not to remodel a favela, not to build new housing, not to provide access to public services or to make them insufficient, so that these people will continue visiting.
We think that for instance, governments who draw a lot of income from tourists and know that these tourists are coming because they want to see slums, are unlikely to take action to redevelop those slums, even if it will be economically beneficial in the long term, because most governments think about short term money more than they think about long term growth.
So at the end of the day, when you have slum tourism, you create a link between having tremendous poverty that needs to be replaced and undone, with people coming to visit and spending money along the way.
And ultimately we think that it's unlikely that the people who live in those slums should want to maintain their own living style just so that they can be gawked at.
So we don't think the government's are fulfilling their obligations to those people by maintaining these slums.
Our last point is about a false sense of understanding that people game when they visit these slums.
Realize that when you go to a favela or a shanty town or wherever, on one of these slum tours, that you're not getting a real picture of what the area is like to live in.
For instance you're likely to visit the safest parts, you're likely to do it during the day, and you're going to have tour guides who can keep you away from anything that's really dangerous or bad.
So we think that people will form a rosy view of these impoverished communities.
They won't recognize that there's a lack of access to services and education, or that people don't have a lot of opportunities, or otherwise they will form a more positive view than they should.
Almost nobody who lives in extreme poverty would want these things to continue, but these people who visit might now might think that they're not so bad, and that we don't need to help these people as much as we actually do.
We think that in the long run this will lead to people being less sympathetic and empathetic towards the people who live in these conditions.
So for these reasons, we think some tourism is bad for the people who live in the slums, and for that reason that it does more harm than good.
Thank you."
"Private universities bring more good than harm.
So, when we're talking about private universities, we think that, any non public university is fair for debate within this round, we think that includes both for profit, and not for profit institutions, and so, we would say that on balance, between all those institutions, private universities bring more good than harm.
So firstly, what we want to talk about is the right to education, and the right to choice in education, and secondly, we are going to talk about the tangible impacts that come from private universities.
So firstly, on choice.
So we think that, people should have the ability to choose where they want to go to be educated.
Education is a crucial function of being able to be socially mobile, to be economically mobile within a society, and to better oneself, and attain employment.
So, given that it is such a crucial part and a crucial aspect of life as we know it, within our societies, we think that people should have the autonomy and the choice, to choose where they're going to go.
We would say that private universities, not only offer more variety to those choices, but also ensures that you have competition for public institutions.
We think that, if all upper if all education, all university education, came simply from public institutions, we think there would be very little check on these institutions, and therefore we think that it's likely that these institutions would be prone to a number of harms, including corruption, trying to be trying to gain money through these public institutions.
We think prices could possibly go up, when there's no check on the prices of these institutions, and more importantly when there's no competition to draw these students, you don't have to focus as hard and as much on trying to improve those educational institutions.
So we think that, private universities are good, simply by their existence, regardless of whether or not there are external benefits, that we would say there are, simply because it provides competition that is desperately needed to check public institutions.
But, what do we think are the true benefits a private universities?
So, we think that private universities have the benefit of being able to draw upon: one, a very long history that allows for more donations, what this looks like tangibly is the fact that harvard, yale, and other ivy league, and non ivy league institutions are often much older than the public institutions that we have, which means that there's more prestige to these institutions, and it allows for a larger conglomeration of great minds in in our academic spheres, and insures that there was a long, and illustrious, history of donors that are willing to give to these institutions, and these institutions are crucial for academic scientific research, and things that allow for our society to progress.
Many of the advancements, that have come scientifically, have come from private universities, and private research, that is done by those universities, because these universities have a profit incentive oftentimes, to be as productive as possible, to produce as much research as possible, to have as much academic prestige as possible, because this is how they draw both more more donations, and how they draw undergraduates, who end up paying into the college itself.
We think that, when there is this competition, when there's this competition, and a profit incentive that only private universities are going to have, within that you're more likely to get tangible academic research that has real benefits, things like, scientific progress, medical research that isn't driven simply by selling a product, but also motivated by being able to produce tangible gains for society writ large.
We think that, the profit incentive, that these universities do, is different from private businesses, in that they're they're is not simply trying to sell a product, though sometimes they will create products, but they create broad tangible advancements, that can then be applied to many different spheres of life, in different economic sectors, that will, in the long run, be more beneficial.
The fact that, these universities uniquely have the ability to draw in donors, in a way that public institutions do not, especially because they are a large place, for wealthy individuals to conglomerate, and therefore a place where wealth will often flow into at a rate that public universities simply will not have.
We think that, on balance, private universities bring more good than harm."
"We should abolish zoos.
So in this debate we're not talking about conservation parks or places that exist solely for the benefit and rehabilitation of animals, we're talking about zoos that exist pretty much exclusively for the entertainment of people who visit them.
I have in mind the bronx zoo, but there are obviously thousands of zoos like this around the world.
So three arguments for why we should abolish these zoos: first is that we think they are fundamentally cruel to the animals which they house.
In nature, animals would always have access to much more space to roam around then they will in a zoo.
Even some of the largest zoos, like the one in san diego, or the one in north carolina, still cannot provide animals with the type of habitat that they would have in nature.
An elephant that would normally roam over tens of thousands of acres might be limited to a few hundred acres in the best zoo.
In smaller urban zoos, we tell you that it's likely that they're limited to one or two acres.
This is similar to keeping people in prison.
In the same way that we see that it is a punishment to prevent people from moving around, we think that these animals are also arbitrarily being punished by being denied access to the space they would normally have to provide themselves with a high quality of life.
We think it's unlikely that these animals are able to self actualize when they're confined to a tiny area like a zoo.
But on top of that, we think it's cruel because it denies the animals the ability to socialize naturally.
In nature animals likely meet dozens of other members of their own species or at the very least have more choice about how they socialize.
Whereas in a zoo, perhaps they're kept with other members of their species, or perhaps they're kept in isolation.
Which seems like a tremendous amount of torture given that it is illegal to keep people in isolation without any good reason.
At that point we think that zoos are ultimately harmful for the mental and physical well being of the animals that they house, that they are cruel, and that it is not just to torment other creatures for the enjoyment of humans.
Therefore we should abolish zoos.
Our second argument is that zoos provide poor education to the people who visit them.
The argument that I anticipate the other side making will be that zoos raise awareness of issues like conservation.
But we think zoos actually build what we'll call false consciousness about these issues.
People go to the zoo and think that donating money to the zoo, for instance, is a good way to prevent species from going extinct or to help conservation.
But it doesn't really follow to me that giving money to a zoo in new york city does a lot to help out elephants in africa.
It seems more likely that things like conservation parks, national geographic specials television programs etcetera, could all do a better job of raising an money for conservation without the huge overhead of running a giant zoo.
We just don't think that this is a good way to educate people in terms of our use of resources.
And also people don't always take away good messages from zoos.
They devalue and commodify animals in a way that makes them seem like cheap sources of entertainment for people rather than beings deserving of respect.
Our third and final point is that we think zoos are a poor use of funds.
Recognize that many zoos are funded by the public.
We think that this is inexcusable.
First of all, zoos don't actually do a lot to promote conservation.
So if you think that the government needs to spend money on conservation, this is a bad way to do it.
We don't see that the government subsidizes other forms of entertainment in this way, so we also don't think that you can win this debate on those grounds.
But moreover, any money spent on zoos is not money spent on helping people.
We think that if you care about things like education and people's well being, that you should spend money on schools rather than zoos.
These institutions cost millions of dollars to run, often don't break a profit, and don't seem to be a good investment for municipal or state governments.
So for these reasons we should abolish zoos.
Thank you."
"Homeschooling should be banned.
So, we think that the model is pretty straightforward for this round.
We would say that you just shouldn't let any homeschooling occur for any grades between k through twelve.
If that were to occur, obviously there would be fines, punishments, jail time, something that is proportional and set by the political body, proportional to violation of this law.
So, two main arguments.
The first is about socialization and the second's about quality of education.
On socialization: we think that young age is one the most important time for an individual to learn social cues and norms and to start to feel out the process of interacting with people you both do and do not like.
We think that in the in these young ages, as a youth, these are the times when you are most that are most formative in you picking up the patterns of interactions that are commonplace on a social level.
Of course, there are other opportunities for this socialization, but the but why school is so important is is that it provides regularity in testing out those social interactions.
It provides that type of pattern recognition and recognition and repetition that allows children to learn this behavior.
So why does learning social norms even matter?
Why do we care that people are learning how to be socially acute?
Well, firstly, this allows children to become savvy adults who know how to navigate various situations they will face.
The conflict resolution skills, the social cues that you pick up as a child, are all crucial in learning how to navigate the adult world, learning how to navigate situations in which you may have to deal with people that you don't want to deal with, deal with adversity, of working with those you may not like.
These are the skills you pick up at a young age and to not go to school, to be homeschooled, means you lose out on valuable repetition, on valuable pattern building, and it means that you're less likely to be that savvy adult that can stand on their own and interact in a social sphere.
Children also learn about themselves and who they are through these normal interactions.
They learn about whether or not they're someone that is more outgoing, they learn about what drains their energy and how they can conserve that energy.
You start to pick up on these cues at a very young age, and you start forming habits that stick with you for the rest of your life.
And finally, we think that the friends and bonds that you build in the school system is incredibly beneficial for the social and emotional support that one needs, especially at a young age.
And we think that homeschooling denies people of forming those bonds.
All right.
So, secondly, on quality of education.
We think the quality of education is likely to be higher in a school, even if parents can get the credentials to teach or hire a tutor.
Few reasons: first, more teacher experience for those in the schools.
We think that you're just more likely to have experienced teachers than you are when you have parents that are doing this for the first time or simply hiring a tutor to teach your child.
This means that you're probably going to have people with better educational techniques who can better inform and actually educate your child, which is the most important aspect of the education system.
Secondly, we think you have more diversity of of personalities amongst teachers and allows students to find teachers and aides they work well with, teachers that understand their learning styles and that allow them, again, to be educated better.
We also think the infrastructure at schools allow for more diverse classes.
Classes like programming, classes like band, classes like home economics, these are things that you don't get in the home system when you have people that are simply ensuring that you meet the general requirements of of a GED, of meeting the general requirements of a high school graduate.
Fourthly, we think that there're extracurriculars that you simply cannot get in the home.
This also compounds with the socialization harms, and we think you're better set up for the future when your grades are coming from an accredited institution or a school than if it's coming from some sort of home school.
We think for both socializing children and for educating your children that home schools are inferior to public or private schools and for these reasons, homeschooling should be banned."
"We should end the use of mass surveillance.
First, let's define mass surveillance.
We're talking about things like the massive NSA spying program in the united states with which the american government collects information not only on every single american citizen including location, who you interact with, where you go, what you buy, but also people around the world including in countries like germany where there was a large public scandal when it came to light that the US government was spying on citizens and government officials.
We think that the defining trait of mass surveillance is that it applies to everyone rather than one individual.
We're okay with the united states government spying on the kremlin.
The problem that we have is the US government collecting information on every person in america and the european union and perhaps all around the world.
Our first main argument is that this is a violation of privacy and our second is that it's a threat to democracy.
So why is this a violation of privacy?
Well, this seems pretty straightforward.
People operate with the assumption that what they do in the privacy of their own homes is private.
For instance if someone is a closeted homosexual, they might for instance consume media that's aimed at gay people whereas they wouldn't do such a thing in public and they might have a reasonable expectation that in their home they could secretly consume this media and no one else would find out.
But due to the NSA spying program, the US government now has information about who these people are, what they're doing and what their preferences are.
Now you might say that's not such a big concern.
What do people have to hide?
It's not like the american government is going to go after these people for being gay.
But we don't know the future, right?
You can clearly see how this could be used to abuse people.
If you think about the stasi, the secret police in east germany, one way that they use to coerce people into cooperating with the regime would be to find out that people were secretly gay and then to blackmail them and threatened to tell their family or their community so that they would have to do whatever the regime told them.
The american government certainly wouldn't do that right now, one would hope, but we don't know if that could be done in the future so we need to insure against the possibility of future tyranny and it's also not beyond the realm of possibility that the US government would share this information with dictators abroad.
We see that the US has helped many dictators abroad to retain power and help to put new dictators into power in countries like chile in the past.
So I wouldn't put it past the american government to give this information to foreign governments to help them coerce their own citizens.
But moreover, we just think that people have a right to choose to interact with whom they will without the government constantly watching over them.
This has been the case throughout human history and it's only recently that the government has been able to intrude in our lives this way.
Therefore, we need to end the use of mass surveillance to restore people's privacy.
Our second argument is about how this is a threat to democracy.
If you have people who are opposed to the current government or opposed to current leaders, it's almost impossible for them to organize due to mass surveillance.
Even if they take extreme precautions the US government is really adept at using people's meta data, that is to say, secondary or tertiary information about someone that they gather from other people's internet use or from unrelated parts of their own internet use to determine what people's political views are and what groups they're a member of.
This is one way that they catch a lot of terrorists in america and britain for instance.
We tell you that the problem is that if people wanted to overthrow their government or to fight against tyranny, they wouldn't be able to.
For instance, if lots of people were planning to go after erdogan in turkey, let's say as a kind of quasi undemocratic leader, the american government due to their obligations to nato might feel the need to turn over who these people are to erdogan.
So you can see how this could be a threat to a democratic movement in turkey.
For all these reasons, we need to end the use of mass surveillance.
Thank you."
"We should ban free newspapers.
We think that in the current time in which social media is the area in which most people get their news, in a time in which fake news is being propagated at a tremendous rate, and it is easier than ever to publish yourself and paint yourself as a legitimate news source in in in instances in which people often or corporations often are not legitimate news sources, we think it is more crucial now than ever that we get good reporting and that we get substantial reporting about issues that matter.
So we're going to talk about why free newspapers undermine the ability for society to get these things, and why those things are so crucial.
So, we would say that payment equalizes the playing field of journalism that exists in the status quo.
It creates competition between newspapers on a level playing field, as opposed to the status quo, in which free newspapers are obviously much more attractive to people, because they don't have to pay for this news coverage, especially in a time in which people can get free news very easy online, without having to go through any legitimate payment.
But we think that accurate news needs to be more properly rewarded.
And we think that what we've seen in recent times is that real journalism simply cannot be sustained based on ad revenue alone.
This is why we're seeing a number of legitimate news sources, such as the wall street journal, the boston globe, the new york times, put up paywalls for their content.
This is because real hard-hitting investigative journalism requires more than just ad revenue to come into a site, but it also requires people to pay a little more than ads can generate based on the views of individuals alone.
This is why these sites have decided to put up paywalls in the first place.
We think that what is the case in the status quo is that you have a situation in which people are going to get free newspapers, are trying to get this this free news, undermining the ability for these corporations to make a profit, it undercuts the ability for the new york times to make a profit when there's a especially when there's a paywall, if people can go to sites and to go to newspapers that don't require this type of payment to take place.
What this means is that we think in the long run you're less likely to get legitimate news sources propagating, and you're less likely to get important news being reported.
We think that there are several implications of this that are crucial.
We think that when you undercut this market, it ruins investigative journalism, and this means that issues that otherwise wouldn't have been reported, issues that require not just CNN to put forward a headline, or for the AP to propagate a story and for free newspapers to pick it up and put it out there, issues that are widely under-covered, issues that are incredibly important to the people that they are that are involved in these issues and involved in these stories, do not get public attention, which means there's less political will to act on these important issues.
For example, the new york times just put out an article about the HIV epidemic amongst african american gay men, and how while HIV rates have gone down across the board in the united states, for this group in particular those rates have actually been steady ever since HIV became a major problem in the nineteen eighties, and in fact these rates have gone up.
This is important journalism, investigative journalism that takes an immense amount of manpower and an immense amount of time, and cannot be supported based on ad revenue alone.
But it is an important political issue that people need to be made aware of, because it impacts the lives of thousands of people and it affects their well-being.
Additionally, we think that you get a less informed populace when you have the long-term transition from newspapers and legitimate news sources that can't be supported based on ad revenue, to those that are cheaper in which less investigation is going on, in which less real work is being put into the stories and the ideas that are put out there.
We think that this means that you have a less informed political climate, you have a less informed political body, and this means that your country is going to be en masse less represented and less educated, and that politicians have less of a check.
We think that that news media is crucial, but we think that it's more important that we support legitimate news sources, and these sources cannot compete with free newspapers as it stands in the status quo.
And for these reasons, we should ban free newspapers."
"Organ donation should be mandatory.
So by this we mean that liberal democracies like the US, canada, britain, ought to require people to add themselves to organ donation lists, and should require them to give up tissue if they are called upon.
So we think that living people might be asked to give part of like their liver or something like that, and that the deceased ought have any necessary organs harvested if it's going to save someone else's life.
So that's our stance in this debate.
Two arguments.
The first is about why we think needy people are more deserving of organs than anyone else.
So we think first of all that for a living donor, yes, there's a certain amount of pain and inconvenience and risk when you go in for a surgery to have some of your tissue removed, but that all of these things are outweighed by saving another person's life.
We think that first of all, we can probably offer some sort of compensation as a reward for people who give tissue.
You know, make up for their time that they're losing it work and things like that.
But at the end of the day we think that saving someone's life because we're giving them a new liver or a new kidney is always going to be better than preventing a little bit of pain and inconvenience for someone else.
And in terms of the deceased, I think there's no way that the other side can get up here and say that someone's desire to be buried or cremated in a certain condition outweighs another person's right to life.
In a a body is an inanimate object, it doesn't have any sort of rights whatsoever, and we don't think that the person's family or community has a greater claim to it than someone who's very life is at risk if they don't have access to the organs from that body.
So we think that in every instance, particularly in the instance of the deceased, they should be required to put all their organs up so that people in need are able to access them.
We think that furthermore, that since healthcare is a fundamental right according to the constitutions of many countries and their laws, and also according to things like the UN declaration of human rights, that governments need to take a radical action to better protect the health of people who aren't very wealthy.
We see that around the world there are many more people who need organs then their organs available.
So those with the most wealth and privilege and power are the only ones who are ever able to access these organ transplants.
We think governments should take radical action to increase the supply of organs so that people who aren't as fortunate will also be able to access them, and the only way to do that is to have mandatory donation, because there's no way that they're just going to convince people to give these away for free otherwise on the other side of the house.
At that point, we think it's clear that governments need to step in and take action here because people who are in desperate need of organs are not able to access them right now in the status quo.
But our second argument is that is twofold.
First, we say that ethically, we always ought donate organs.
We think that if something is a universalizable, basically if everyone were to do an action and that action would be better for society or the world, then that action is probably the right thing to do.
And we can see that if everyone in the world were to give up you know a little bit of organ tissue that they don't need to live in order to save a child's life, that the world be a better place.
And if every dead body had its organs harvested, then we probably wouldn't need very many living people to get tissue first of all, and secondly, we would be saving living people at the expense of the dead.
I think it's clear that this would always be the right thing to do.
So at that point we tell you that the state needs to take action to make the ethical thing happen.
We think states are ethical actors who need to act according to the same standards as individuals because they're made up of and represent individuals.
The other team might say that government shouldn't be bound by the same morality as ordinary people, but at the point where presidents and prime ministers are ordinary people, we think that they need to act in a fundamentally ethical way when they make decisions about how the government should use its power.
So at that point, because on our side we are saving people's lives, particularly people without a lot of privilege and money, because we are allocating a very limited resource in the most effective possible way, and because this is the right thing to do, organ donation should be mandatory."
"We're proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should limit the right to self-defense.
I'll model this as essentially getting rid of protections for imperfect self-defense.
So we would only protect self defense if you know basically the threat holds out that it turns out that the person actually was justified you know if they actually wind up being attacked or something like that or if it turns out the person actually did have a weapon we would only basically we wouldn't protect people if it turned out that they had made the wrong call.
So our first independent point is that people have a tendency to misjudge situations, and that giving them legal protections for misjudging that situation can often have drastic consequences.
So people react imperfectly of course when they're under high stress scenarios, especially ones where they believe their lives might be in danger.
Given that they are of course disproportionately likely to act with you know violence or extreme force in self defense.
This is a problem though because there are a lot of factors that go into people's heads about whether or not they're in danger that are not good indicators of whether or not they're in danger.
One particularly good example of this is racial discrimination and how you know people feel that they are just you know less safe around particular races particularly like black and hispanic men.
This is important because that's not actually an indicator of how safe you are, it's just an indicator like you have slightly racist attitudes and that you're going to like take that out on a particular individual.
But so that's a problem of course then is that innocent people are suffering because of someone else's racist attitudes but even more basic things like just the fact that when you're scared you get paranoid means that people are likely to react disproportionately to things that they perceive as threats.
So as a result protections that allow you to you know basically use force even if the threat doesn't hold out essentially allows people or gives them invitation to be trigger happy.
That in turn results in significant harms.
There are obviously stories all over the place of you know trayvon martin for example arm where an individual essentially got trigger happy because they were spooked by things that weren't actually grounds for fearing for one's life and then someone lost their life because of that.
And this is of significant impact right?
Death is obviously pretty bad and we think that that's a significantly more important impact on the right to self-defense in the abstract.
This is an important take away as well, is that the worst case scenario is someone was justified in engaging in self-defense and they'd like die because of it.
You have to compare that though against the fact that if someone acts out in self-defense unjustly and then kills a person, that's also death.
That's the same impact.
So I think at this point then that's a wash in the best interpretation for op.
But I want to go on then to my second independent point which is that you should always be penalized for inflicting needless suffering.
So I think obviously under the situation where you were justified in acting in self-defense like that is like reasonable then for it to be called self-defense because you know you actually were in danger.
The problem then is that when you act unjustly that is that you weren't actually in danger, there's an inherent problem that someone suffer because you acted in self-defense and attacked an individual but no one actually was penalized for that, no one was held accountable for the suffering that was enacted.
This is inherently an issue and I think like some moral hazard argument doesn't actually make up for the fact that somebody genuinely suffered at another's hands without recourse.
Oftentimes if people genuinely fear for their life and are actually confident that this person holds a threat to them, they're going to act regardless of the legal repercussions because they don't want to die.
So I think what actually happens here in terms of the impact calculus is just people that are way more towards the edge of feeling slightly uneasy but like really trigger happy are the ones that will actually change their decision making calculus on our side of the house.
Given that we think we generate less suffering.
Proud to propose."
"We should abolish the right to silence.
Our society has far too many laws and protections for individuals who are actually guilty.
Things like probable cause and the right to a lawyer guarantee that innocent people are protected from unjust punishment by the state but the ability to remain silent when asked a direct and simple question does nothing more than protect the guilty or providing no benefits for the innocent.
Because of this, we are ultimately against the right to silence and propose the following model.
So in the status quo, what happens is when someone is silent either to the police or in a court of law the jury cannot interpret that silence to mean anything.
That is to say if someone says they plead the fifth amendment that answering the question could lead to their own incrimination the jury isn't allowed to say hmm this person might be guilty.
Now in our world after we abolish the right to silence, when a lawyer or a cop asks you a direct question like do you have drugs in the back of your car and you refused to answer they can infer things from that silence.
They can then search your car if you refused to say anything.
Additionally if you lied if you refuse to say something in a court of law they can also infer stuff from your silence that the jury can use it for a better decision.
I have two arguments for why this is a good idea.
First off on the purpose of courts.
We believe that courts are truth seeking in nature.
This is for two reasons.
First they are truth seeking in order to guarantee we get the most correct punishment and the most correct decision possible out of the court system.
Truth depends on the greatest access of information.
There are very few capital t he truths in our world that is to say things that are objectively true however the only way that we can discern between truths,the only way that we can make a educated decision is when there is as much information as possible.
Individuals remaining silent reduce that information and as such inherently reduce the efficacy of the court system.
Secondly though, rights should only protect the innocent while also ensuring justice.
There's an inherent tradeoff here and in certain cases it's okay to harm the innocent to a minor degree if it massively increases our chance of getting justice.
Now where does the right to silence fall within this ratio?
We would say that it almost never protecs the innocent.
If someone asks you did you kill that woman and you say no and you're telling the truth the ultimate result is that you will not be punished.
However if you are silent in the status quo people cannot infer anything from it.
We would say that this is fundamentally against justice.
All that will happen as a result of this sort of policy is that criminals will either remain silent to the benefit of the court or they will lie and get additional punishments creating a clear incentive for them to tell the truth or at the very least be silent so that the jury can infer things from their silence.
We would say that's far more likely that we'll get successful guilty verdicts in this world and actually guarantee that victims get the justice that they deserve.
My second argument is about the pragmatic values of crime reduction and truth within the court system.
First we think that cops will generally need to spend less time investigating trials.
We think that the primary purpose of police officers should be to prevent crimes and protect individuals in the short term rather than investigate previous crimes that have already occurred.
We would say that if a person is being silent, you can cops can then use that silence to get things like warrants or if they lie and you can disprove a lie and then you have to spend less information overall because it's very clear that they have committed the crime to prove that they're lying even if you can't prove that they have necessarily done any particular action.
Additionally we think that the general benefit of putting more people in jail to a just outcome when they are actually guilty means that people will be harmed less in the future victims will generally get more justice and the whole of society will be happier and safer.
For this reason that we should abolish the right to silence."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should protect the antarctic continent.
Three independent points.
First, animal rights.
So we think that when there is resource deprivation in the antarctic continent this is something that disproportionately harms animals, that if you were to drill it for oil or other natural resources or you were to start fishing there, you would hurt the local wildlife.
So with fishing I think this link is pretty clear, that if you kill lots of fish obviously the fish are harmed but when you drill for natural resources, I think alaska is a good example of this, the air pollution and land eroding harms things like polar bears or penguins or other like species that are native to the area.
So why do animal rights matter then?
We think that the standard for when whether or not something has rights that has is should have acttive protection against experiencing undue pain is when they are capable of experiencing pain and pleasure.
For animals this this standard obviously applies.
I think if you like punch an animal you can see that it reacts badly.
There are obvious stimuli you can provide to animals and which they will respond in a way that demonstrates that they are capable of experiencing pain and pleasure.
I think the reason why we use the standard is mostly a function of the fact that one any other standard is necessarily that we shouldn't be determining things based off like intelligence or something like that I think that would justify like discriminatelt against developmentally disabled humans but also I think the s-stan-standard is a function of the fact that there is just like no other objective way to determine whether or not something should experience pain or pleasure.
Pain is a bad thing that we should avoid causing suffering when we can and in the case of animals this is clearly something we are doing by protecting their capacity to live within their natural habitat.
Our second independent point is sea levels.
So I don't really have time to flesh this out in full way but I think generally speaking global warming is something that is happening.
You know this is something that like ninety seven percent of scientists agree on and I think I can just like leave it at that.
That this is something that is real.
So what does that mean?
We should protect the antarctic continent in the sense that we should combat global warming because melting of arctic and antarctic ice contributes to global see r-rising sea levels.
So this is important I think even if you take like the screw the animals we only care about humans perspective because this is something that directly affects humans.
Coastal flooding like displaces millions if not billions of humans from their homes.
It probably leads to significant deaths through the increase incidence of natural disasters.
This is something that definitely harms human life and we think that preventing rising sea levels by mitigating the amount of arctic and antarctic ice that is melting is something that we should prioritize.
Third is natural beauty.
So I think there is like an intrinsic aesthetic value to the antarctic continent that these sweeping of snow scapes and these landscapes that are incredibly appealing to the eye are something that is worth protecting.
Like in the same way that we care about national parks within our own countries this is something that is part of like what makes the earth an incredible place.
That there is this very this very beautiful aspect to the landscape and it's important right like even if this is a place where not a lot of people go I think this is just something that matters.
I think this is just a reasonable thing to protect insofar it is a part of our planet, it is something that is awe inspiring, and it's something worth protecting because I think the trade off is pretty minimal.
Oil is not a sustainable resource to drive our energy needs, fishing can be done elsewhere, also the fish probably have rights anyway.
Like generally speaking the tradeoff here is that we are devastating a thing that has intrinsic beauty and is awe inspiring in exchange for very small returns, and I think that's a good enough reason to vote proud to propose."
"We should limit the right to self defense so when we say we're going to limit the right to self defense what we mean is that this right is not absolute that you should have to take reasonable steps not to use violence not to harm an attacker before that self defense can be justified so things like stand your ground laws we would say are bad you need to take reasonable steps not to use force and if you immediately chose to use force we would say that you would be liable in court for the violence that you've done.
Okay why do we think that this is the case?
First we would say that people use poor judgment when acting in self defense and second we would say that we want to avoid any sort of punishment through non legal channels and that self defense is in practice and in reality a form of punishment for an act that someone has done.
So on that first point.
When people feel they are at risk they are much more liberal with using force.
People's biases affect how they process risk for example people have a subjective of subjective bias against black men this is something that's built been built up through our media and through our history for centuries and this is something that when a black person when a black man is coming at you in a way that you view to be opposing you're more likely to use force against them than you are if it was a white man.
This is a this is just one of the ways in which our subjective biases can affect how we process the actual risk that is being done against us and if we can't trust those if we can't trust our subjective measurement of that risk then we should at least have to curtail whether or not we're going to use violent acts to protect ourselves when we really might not be protecting ourselves or at least not protecting ourselves from the risk that we think we are facing.
We think that a full right to self defense relies on people actually acting in self defense the majority of the time that they actually know not just that they are in danger but the level and degree of danger that they are in because even if someone is assaulting me even if someone is going to punch me in the face or do something like that we would say that because doing something like shooting them like taking their life is not proportional it's not a reasoned response to the risk I'm facing if you can't both recognize that you are at risk and recognize the level of risk self defense needs to be curtailed.
So for these reasons we think that people simply are bad judges of the risk that they are facing and because of this self defense cannot be absolute for it to be just.
Alright so we will also want to avoid punishment through non legal channels.
Punishment is only distinguishable from assault or an attack because of the legal system of judgment.
A fair trial guarantees an unbiased ruling and a proportional response at least in theory and when compared to self defense in practice it does a much better job of getting the proportioned response.
We think spur of the moment act of self defense is paralleled to punishment insofar as it a is insofar as it is a response to a crime.
It comes about because of a crime.
We think that that self defense does not have any of those checks that the legal system does it does not give you an a chance as a defendant to state your case to explain your actions to explain why you might have been doing the thing you're doing and why it isn't deserving of punishment.
Limiting the right to self defense results in more instances of people fleeing flight rather than fight.
And we think that this means that a fair and reasoned response from the justice system is more likely if I am at risk and I choose to flee rather than to kill my assault rather than to kill my assailant then that assailant is more likely to go before a court is more likely to get some sort of verdict rule and the response that we get we are more secure as a society in knowing that is the correct response then simply allowing people to have an absolute right to self defense.
For these reasons we should limit the right of self defense."
"We should subsidize biofuels.
So, biofuels, for those who aren't aware, are fuels similar to gas or diesel, which are made from plant material, as opposed to you know fuels that are taken out of the ground as minerals.
So ethanol, for instance, is generally made from corn, in countries like the US and brazil.
Biodiesel is made from various sources and is more popular in the european union and india.
So, with this in mind, we think that there are two main reasons why they should be subsidized, and you know by subsidize we think that the state should make it less expensive to produce these biofuels, through tax credits and things like that.
Too big arguments.
The first is about sustainable growth.
So, to start out with: any country's economic growth is dependent on their ability to access cheap energy.
What does this mean?
If your country relies heavily on gasoline or diesel, then your growth is going to be stunted in the long term, because the cost of those energy sources will only increase as they become more scarce.
There's a finite amount of crude oil in the ground from which to make these fuels, which means that as we extract more and more oil from the ground, it will become more expensive in the long term.
Scientist fifteen years ago thought there would be something called peak oil, where oil would get so expensive no one could afford it anymore.
That seems to have been averted by the invention of fracking, and the discovery of other oil sources, but it does seem that, you know, if you're thinking forty to fifty years down the line, it's much better to invest in an energy source that replenishes itself, rather than one which will run out, even if it doesn't run out for another two hundred years.
On top of that though, we think you should subsidize it because it promotes growth in terms of your economy, we see that this is a new industry which is booming.
The infrastructure that you create, by subsidizing the production of biofuels, is going to be useful infrastructure over the long term.
If you build more oil refineries, or if you more extraction facilities, say if the US and mexico continue to extract more and more oil from the gulf of mexico, those facilities are fundamentally useless once you've extracted the oil from underneath them, and eventually they'll all be useless, when we run out of oil to begin with.
If you invest in plants refined corn though, well, corn hopefully isn't going anywhere, we'll be able to produce energy with this infrastructure for hundreds of years, or to build off of it, to build and develop even better future infrastructure and discovering new technologies, that will let us use this technology even more efficiently.
So ultimately, we think you should subsidize biofuels, because it will promote sustainable long term development within your country.
Our second argument for why you should subsidize biofuels is to promote self sufficiency for your country, in terms of energy as opposed to imports.
Remember that, only a few countries in the world actually produce all of the oil that they use.
Even a country like america, or a country like mexico, both of which produce lots of oil, still import oil from other countries like venezuela.
We see that many of the world's largest economies, like china, have virtually no oil production, or very little compared to their consumption, so they're very dependent on imports.
We think that, you should subsidize biofuels because you can produce them in your own country, which means that the wealth that they create, and also the money that you would have spent on imports, now stays in your own economy.
Effectively, this is a way to promote reinvestment, because, for instance, in china if they were to subsidize these biofuels, that would be capital that's being put back into china, paying chinese laborers rather than going to russia or mexico to buy oil.
We think that, on top of that, for countries which rely heavily on oil, subsidizing these biofuels will give them a path to remain sustainable in the future.
A country like russia that is basically a petro state, can guarantee their future economic stability, by supporting this business to replace the oil industry, once that is no longer sustainable.
So for these reasons, we should subsidize biofuels.
Thank you."
"I'm proud to support the motion that we should raise the corporate income tax.
Two independent points, first is that a higher corporate income tax disincentivizes saving income on the part of corporations.
So what we mean by this is when a corporation gets some money you know like they sell stuff and then they get a profit and then they have capital on their hands, they can do one of two things with it.
They could either save it, that is like stash it away in some bank account so they can just use it on a rainy day or they can reinvest it into other things.
They can hire more workers, they could buy more machinery, they can buy land, they can construct new buildings.
This will obviously vary from business to business but the general gist of what we're saying in here is they can do things that fuel economic growth.
That is hire more people, you have a stronger economy, you build more buildings, you produce more goods, the economy of the country is stronger on the whole.
We think then that when you raise the corporate income tax you disincentivize the type of behavior that is more like oh okay we're just going to put this in a bank and save it for later where it just kind of languishes without being used in a way that is constructive towards the expansion of the economy.
On our side of the house, that money is used proactively.
We think that op is probably going to come up here and say something to the effect of like oh but if you raise the corporate income tax rate like they're just like gonna be disincentivized to making any profit at all.
Like one I think this is like a fundamental misunderstanding on the part that just like corporations no matter what rate you tax them at will still try to make money.
But secondly I think it's really important to note that the distinction between profit and like revenue that is like intake because if a corporation say makes a windfall they sell a really cool product or whatever and they make millions of dollars if they just put that in a bank then that is all profit it all gets taxed but if they reinvest it that is they actively spend it then that can be counted as something that is an expense that is not profit it actively counts against your profit and actively lowers the amount of taxes that you have to pay.
Corporate taxation actually incentivizes corporations then to spend that money because specifically it allows them to write it off of their taxes essentially and then be more encouraged to do that the higher the taxation rate is.
Our second independent point though is that this is simply fair that we believe in a proportional tax system and that this is coherent with that world view.
So what we mean by a proportional taxation system is it is one that taxes people at a higher rate when they are wealthier and the underlying theory behind this is just that like wealthy people and corporations by extension are more capable of paying a higher percentage of their income.
You know really poor people for example have to pay large percentages of their income towards basic day-to-day expenditures things like food, shelter whereas richer people will have more disposable income that can be used towards savings or something so it is fair to tax that sort of income that is less necessary for basic day-to-day functions.
So what we see though in terms of the corporate tax is that lots of capital in this country money in general is tied up in corporations.
This is partially because wealthy people own corporations and thus can just put their money into corporations but it's also partially because corporations themselves are just money making machines that by virtue of the way a corporation is if it does well it will have lots of money.
We think then that a just tax system should target places where there is lots of money.
You have to take revenue from somewhere, we would prefer to take it then from cash flush corporations then from comparatively cash poor individuals.
We think then by raising the corporate income tax we can lower the individual income tax and put a higher burden of this country's expenses on the backs of wealthy corporations rather than just like your day-to-day individuals who are struggling to get by.
Proud to propose."
"We should fight nationalism.
In this round we're going to talk about nationalism as a system of beliefs that gives preference and priority to people that are of the similar national origin as you, people that have a similar national background or a nationality to you.
This can exist between between states in national private of one state prioritized over another or even within states having pride of your nationality as a principle over nationalities of other groups that exist within your state.
So we have a few reasons why we think that we should fight nationalism.
The first is that nationalism is a necessarily exclusionary understanding of how society works.
That in order for a nationality to be distinct, you must create a differentiation between your nationality and the other.
And we think in doing so you end up drawing lines that are one, massively stereotypical, two, mythologized and based upon conceptions of a historical understanding of your nationality that simply doesn't exist.
This, for example, exists amongst german nationalities and understanding of a national identity that exists within germany but rather this is a misunderstanding of history compartmentalizing of history in such a way where there's unity created between dozens and dozens of warring factions and warring societies that have some cultural sharing, but not real cultural unity, national identity a national identity that mostly takes place in the last two hundred years but gains roots going back thousands of years that are used to divide one group from another.
We think that this is important both in society but firstly within the state.
Recognize that the state has an obligation to represent all citizens within its control.
The state as a coercive of body has control over how people live their lives, the rights that are granted in those individuals and has a massive course of apparatus that constrains those individuals without their consent.
Given that this is the case the state needs to be sure needs to ensure that all all people's beliefs, all people's livelihoods, are represented and upheld within the state and adopting nationalism at a state level excludes those people both as a signaling mechanism, saying that our state is of this nationality and that if you are not of this nationality you are not welcome here, but also explicitly in in enacting discriminatory legislation that ultimately prefers one national group over another causing in fighting, violence that exists within the state, and different types of discrimination that have serious harms on people's livelihoods.
We think that this is problematic but furthermore we think that globalization is the way of the future.
And we think on a social level it is better to avoid nationalism and to fight nationalism because it goes against both the progress that we know is coming, how global markets are arising at rates incredibly quickly in that these are becoming the ways in which global powers are able to interact, spread their power, and how ideas are able to be shared.
Technology, commerce, all these things exist in a global market space and that when you adopt nationalist policies you ultimately become contentious against those types of global global factors, those types of global pressures that exist.
And we think fighting against the current of globalization is only going to hinder a country's development.
It's only going to exclude it from the massive amount of economic growth potential that exists within a global world.
So we think that adopting nationalism at a social sphere excludes groups both within your state but also makes you less likely to work with other states that don't share the same nationality as you.
That's problematic.
We also think that it leads to massive abuses of immigrants groups.
Immigrant groups within a state are often the most disenfranchised, the most vulnerable because they're coming from a situation which they have very little to bring with them, they have very little working for them.
Even in situations in which they are privileged and they bring certain privileges, certain economic benefits, economic economic standing with them from their former state, these are often people that don't have community ties and when nationalism is adopted these people are often the most marginalized within society and the ones that are often suffering the most discrimination.
We think that nationalism only serves to divide a country, it only serves to discriminate between groups, and it only hinders a country's development and for these reasons we should fight nationalism."
"We should introduce recall elections.
So in some US states, for instance, if people living in that state think the governor is doing a poor job, they can hold a referendum, and everyone votes on whether or not they want to keep the governor or recall him and then elect a new governor.
We think that pretty much every liberal democracy should introduce similar policies.
We've seen this take place in US states, like wisconsin, in recent years.
Two arguments.
The first is about accountability for politicians.
Right now, politicians talk a good talk during elections.
They say that they're going to do things that the people actually care about.
Then they get into office and suddenly they're able to start filling their pockets, and helping out their friends, and listening to big business interests, and basically ignore people until six months before the next election.
There's no accountability for what you do except for the immediate period right before an election.
Because people, generally speaking, have to think about more recent information rather than something you did two years ago.
But what this means is that if we implemented recall elections, you could remove politicians as they did bad things.
Ultimately, we think this has tremendous impacts for a few reasons.
One, it changes the decision-making of politicians up front.
It's now harder to go into politics simply to fill your own pockets or to make money for your friends, so we think that fewer bad people, basically, are going to be willing to go into politics.
But secondly, we also think that it gives you more of an incentive to run on honest policies.
Candidates will have less of an incentive to oversell themselves or to promise things that they can't deliver if they know that they might be removed for failing to fulfill campaign promises.
And thirdly, we think it's much more likely that the politicians who run will actually reflect the will of the constituents, that you'll have support for things like social welfare or policies that ordinary people in their districts want.
The other team might try to tell you that this means politicians will change constantly in order to try to react to the latest polling data, but I don't see why this is necessarily bad.
We think politicians should react to what the people want, even outside of an election year.
It doesn't make much sense to me that simply because you win an election in two thousand sixteen, you should have a mandate to do whatever you want until twenty twenty four.
Circumstances in the world change.
Why shouldn't your governments have to as well?
We can hold people accountable, we can make them be honest, and we think that ultimately this leads to a healthier democracy.
Which leads nicely into our second major argument about democratic engagement.
Right now, if you live in a liberal country, there's really no reason to be engaged in politics between election years.
Nobody really cares about protesters, so you don't have any way to change anything in government if you don't like the way things are going.
You can write to your congressman and things like that, but they don't have any reason to listen to you because they know that ultimately, as long as they're a little better than the other guy during election year, that they don't have anything to worry about.
But if you have the ability to have recall elections, then suddenly it makes sense for people to be engaged throughout their lives rather than only every few years when there's an election.
If people are thinking about whether or not they want to recall a politician, then they need to inform themselves on the issues.
So you create more of an incentive for people to be informed.
But on top of that, you create an incentive for people to contact their elected officials, to think about who else could be governing them.
And we think that this means that people will be more democratically engaged.
A democracy really only works if people are voting, if people are thinking about the issues, that people care and feel like they have a voice.
It's a big problem right now and a reason why there's such low voter turnout in the west, that people don't think they have a voice.
They don't think their vote matters.
We think that we shift that kind of decision-making on our side by encouraging people to participate in electoral politics and in democracy in between election years so that it matters much more to their ordinary day-to-day lives.
So because of accountability and because of democratic engagement, we should introduce recall elections.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should protect endangered species.
Two main areas of clash, the first on why you ought protect, generally, living beings and why these animals have value in the first place.
Because we acknowledge that animals might not have as many rights as human, but recognize that the same criteria that we assign to humans that tell us that they have rights we can also ascribe to animals.
Many of these reasons include humans suffer and feel pain, they contextualize an image of the past and the future, and they have family units in which they enjoy the presence of some people and form strong relationships with some people.
A lot of these criteria also apply to a majority of animals.
All almost every animal, aside from insects or single celled organisms, experiences suffering and contextualizes their past and their purpose in existence and the majority of animals also have strong relationships with others of their species.
This mean if they meet the same criteria as humans this probably means that they have some sort of rights similar to those in humans.
In the very least we think that this the less the least arguable right is one that might be a right not to be harmed and a right to just exist as they exist.
So we're not placing an obligation on humans to go out of their way to protect animals if like say I if those humans never caused it in the first place or if it is unrelated to their activities.
But we think that in the very least humans ought leave these animals alone and they have a right to that.
The problem is that humans are directly responsible for the deforestation and global warming that destroys and causes endangered species in the first place.
At the point that there is direct culpability for the harms these animals experience we think there also ought be an obligation to protect them after we create the situations in which they start dying off.
We think this is this is also why we see situations in which someone in which if like you cause a certain conflict in another country we expect reparations to be paid, such as like world war one when germany was charged with them, we see this things as justified because if you cause a significant harm you ought have to mend it.
The same applies in situations such as these animals, we cause the situations in which they start suffering so we ought have to protect them afterwards.
But if you don't believe that our secondary of clash has to do with utility to humanity.
Because a lot of the time these animals are part of complicated ecosystems that we don't completely understand and we don't understand the impact of an animal going extinct in those systems.
So a lot of the time what happens is that this animal was either predator or prey.
If it's an important predator, it means that not having that predator in the ecosystem blows up whoever they were hunting and oftentimes causes problems for humans.
So this often happens in rural areas of the united states where we no longer have tigers or hyenas that haunt town that hunt down deer.
And so you end up with massive populations of deer in these areas and no one really knows what to do with them.
They become nuisances, they're dangerous to humans because they end up crashing into your cars, and like and causing unsafe circumstances.
But because we've basically created unlivable situations for their predators we cannot do anything about it.
The other alternative is that these animals disrupt the ecosystem in the other direction.
They were the prey and now the predator has nothing to eat and so in situations where the animal was helpful to you, the predator in particular was helpful to the to humans it no longer exists and thus you end up with to with with like not enough with other pests that are like more of them or you end up not having this other animal as well.
So you end up with a chain of extinction essentially.
What but the other issue with this is that a lot of the time we don't know what these animals have to give us.
Many secrets with regards to medicine or future therapeutic needs have been discovered by examining the genomes of different animals.
When an animal goes extinct you can no longer research what that animal does or how they can benefit humans in the long term and so we think that you ought be protecting them in the first place.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"We should end the use of mass surveillance.
Three main arguments: first, on the right to privacy.
When citizens exist under a government, they don't opt into having their lives documented and viewed in the same way that they might opt into laws that limit their mobility or require their registration.
This is necessarily undemocratic because when asked, every single person would say that this isn't what they want and isn't how they want their government behaving.
Insofar as the government is supposed to reflect the will of the majority of individuals, and way more than the majority would say they don't want to be mass surveilled, we think that already this is enough reason to vote for gov.
But the other issue here is that we think that people just don't feel comfortable being individuals and accessing the freedoms that are guaranteed by things like the constitution.
So when we say like the right to the pursuit of liberty and life and freedom and the pursuit of happiness, these things are dependent on individuals being comfortable with themselves and comfortable with their environment.
There's this thing in psychology called the hawthorne effect which is, essentially, that individuals who know that they are being watched change the way that they behave, because people are awkward by nature.
They feel embarrassed about things that they maybe shouldn't feel embarrassed about, but there are also stigmas in society that make them feel embarrassed about completely normal processes and completely normal actions.
What this means is that things that are often central to our identity and central to our self-actualization are also things that someone wouldn't perform in public.
This can be everything from the type of media you consume, from the type of sex that you have, who you have sex with, all of these things are things that get tracked when mass surveillance occurs but individually, things that individuals wouldn't want to be tracked.
So if they knew that mass surveillance was occurring, would stop themselves from doing or be less likely to be to be exhibiting.
And we think that this directly inhibits the rights that are codified in the constitution.
So even if you don't buy into the idea of the right to privacy, we think you do have to buy into the underlying framework of our nation and recognize that it needs to be supported.
Our second argument is about giving too much power to the police.
Literally everybody commits small crimes, whether this is stealing food from your workplace, whether this is something like jaywalking, whether it's checking your neighbor's mail every now and then to make sure that your letter didn't get in there.
All of these and I'm sure there are many more, because a lot of laws are incredibly old and we don't necessarily know what they like what they are when we act in society.
So we think the problem becomes this literally allows the police to just go into those mass surveillance tapes or recordings and find something that they can decide that individual has done.
And even if it's not a reason for arrest, even if it's not a real crime, we think that there's always going to be probable cause, because it's just a matter of digging through the footage for something that looks minorly suspicious.
And we think this is really bad because we think that when police are given such unabridged power, that is when they start to abuse it and that is when we start moving away from a democracy and moving away from individuals having freedom.
That's when we start like fascist regimes get put in place is when the police are just allowed to do whatever they want.
We also think that oftentimes this gets applied in an incredibly asymmetric manner.
Like we see with police brutality, this disproportionately targets people of color within the united states.
And we think oftentimes when police choose to convict someone or accuse someone, this also disproportionately happens to people of color.
Our third argument is about placating the public.
Mass surveillance always leaks because it's something that the average person feels deeply uncomfortable with.
So, oftentimes, even the people doing the surveilling on the part of the government also feel deeply conflicted about the fact that they are doing it.
So this is what you get things like incredibly large public protest and coups.
So if you want to protect the domestic peace, you will stop mass surveilling.
Proud to propose."
"We should lower the drinking age.
So we're going to argue that in jurisdictions where the drinking age is higher than the age of majority, it should be lowered to the age of majority.
So, in america, it should be lowered from twenty-one to eighteen, in ontario, it should be lowered from nineteen to eighteen, and so on.
Three arguments for our side today.
First: we think that the law needs to be principally consistent in order to be legitimate.
Right now in the US, in ontario, in other regions around the world, you can vote as soon as you reach the age of majority.
You can serve in the military, sometimes against your will, you can get a job, you can buy a car or a house, but you can't buy a beer.
We think that ultimately you undermine the effectiveness of the law, when it appears arbitrary in people's eyes.
If people think that the law is arbitrary, they're more likely to disrespect it.
If they think that the law is fair and just, then they're more likely to respect it.
So right now, when people can't buy a beer but they can buy a shotgun in america, we think that people think the law's absurd, and this tells them that the law is not something that they need to respect in a very high way.
So we think that ultimately, because of the high prevalence of underage drinking which is impossible to prevent, you undermine respect for the law, in general, and create a culture where people try to avoid the law and get out of doing things that are legal that is extremely widespread.
Probably, a large majority of american and canadian teenagers drink long before they reach the age when they're permitted to.
If the law were principally consistent, we think more people would have respect for the law and you wouldn't have that culture.
So ultimately, we should lower the drinking age for that reason.
If someone can buy a gun.
We say let them buy a beer.
Our second argument is about personal freedom.
Realize that the people we're discussing in this debate are all adults.
We trust them to make other decisions on their own well-being, for instance, what kind of healthcare they want to have, what education they want to pursue.
They're past the age at which the state is making decisions for them, like making them go to high school.
We think that, with this in mind, it's important that we defer to individual freedom for a few reasons.
One: drinking doesn't really harm anyone else.
It's a personal decision.
Remember that drunk driving is illegal either way.
At that point, we think that governments, in general, should defer to letting people make their own decisions if no one else is at risk.
The reason this is true is that people know their own interests better than anyone else knows their interest.
There's a poverty of information that you and I have about any third person.
They know facts about their own life that we don't have access to.
They know about their own experiences in a way that we never will.
With that in mind, we should defer to letting these individuals make their own decisions about whether alcohol consumption is right for them.
And I think it's quite likely that if you gave people this freedom and respect, that things like binge drinking culture would actually decrease, because people would be empowered to make responsible decisions rather than encouraged to make irresponsible ones, like drinking too much or drinking illegally.
Our third argument today is that we are opposed to public morality, in general.
The main case for making it more difficult for young people to buy alcohol is that certain parts of the population think it's immoral to drink alcohol or to drink alcohol in excess.
We think, again, that individuals should be free to make their own decisions.
If certain christians in america and canada don't want to drink alcohol in excess or don't want to drink at all or don't want to drink until they're older, those people should have every right and freedom to do so, but they shouldn't be able to impose their will on people of other religions, who don't have these particular beliefs.
We think that, in effect, higher drinking ages are a form of morality that's imposed on the general public and that this is not the role of the state.
Ultimately, the government should protect people from each other.
It should uphold the law, but the law that it implements should recognize individuals' own autonomy and not apply one form of viewing the world or one way of life onto everyone.
For these reasons, we should lower the drinking age.
Thank you."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should legalize polygamy.
Three independent points.
First is that legalization is key to autonomy for polygamous or polyandrous individuals.
So I think first that I want to establish here is that autonomy is something that's very important.
It's more or less our most fundamental right basically everything else that we consider to be a right is only a right because we consider it facilitative to our ability to, at a very basic level, decide what it is we want to do with our lives and what it is that we want to happen to us.
For example, the only reason we really care about our right to life is so that we can have a life wherein we make our decisions, wherein we you know sort of experience things as we want to experience them.
So this is really fundamental then.
And I think sexual self expression is specifically important to that right to autonomy because your sexual self expression is something that is extremely key to your individual identity.
A lot of people see this as something that is very, very fundamental to them.
That the right to exercise their their preferences when it comes to sexual relationships and romantic relationships is really, really, really important.
So given that I think then the autonomy to exercise whatever you find fundamental to your own identity is something that links very deeply into your general right to autonomy.
Specifically, with you know polygamy, polyandrous relationships, polyamorous relationships, anything that involves, you know, really just any sort of expression of your sexual identity that doesn't generate third party harms and is fully consensual, we say is something that should be allowed underneath this.
I think for a lot of people this is very, very important to them, this is their just genuine sexual identity in the way that you are I might be gay or straight and at that point I think then it is important to protect their right to engage in that sort of relationship.
Our second independent point though, just beyond the rights claim, is the actual harms that come with and are associated with restricting that identity.
So first I think there's a psychological component to this.
That it is simply, you know, frustrating and, in the long term it is absolutely maddening to be restricted from you know something that is so core to your identity.
But secondly I think there's an emotional component too.
That is when you are repeatedly told that your identity is illegitimate, that you know you are just part of like some crazy religious sect, that you are often conflated with someone who engages in abusive behavior, I think there are people that don't fit this mold, that don't fit the stereotype, and having that emotional toll of being told that your identity is illegitimate is something that has a very profound impact on the individual.
I think there are just very clear utilitarian benefits, therefore, that are associated with allowing these relationships to be officially recognized.
Our third independent point is that the counter factual of unofficial polygamous relationships is significantly worse.
So I do want to establish that obviously op is going to come up here and tell you about like, oh well these you know relationships have a tendency to be laden with abuse and all these other things, I think the problem with this argument is that the type of the type of you know religious components particularly that drive these abusive polygamous relationships are most likely going to continue to do so on either side of the house.
Like you hear constantly about like these underground religious cults that like engage in horrible abusive tactics like that's the status quo.
And I don't think it's going to expand much on their side of the house.
I think the reason for that is that in the status quo it is very tough to report abuse in these relationships and the reason is that you don't have the legal rights that are afforded to officially recognized couple.
When you afford that legal recognition and when you make give this sort of like legal protections that you give to like you know wives, for example, who are abused by their husbands like physically, then I think it becomes a lot easier to engage in that reporting.
You get the protections that are currently afforded to other couples and the abuse that is seen in the status quo in polygamous relationships most likely goes down significantly.
Proud to propose."
"Private education brings more good than harm.
So two things we want to talk about in this debate are why private education allows for more autonomy and allows for better education and secondly, why it's essential to have competition between public and private options.
Okay so firstly, on why education is crucial and why this is good for education.
We think that education is certainly crucial because without having a foundational education firstly, there's no way to have a well rounded understanding of self.
You can't acquire other skills without having a foundational education that allows you to move forward.
So without being able to read, write and access other avenues of information you simply have no ability, you don't have the tools to enrich yourself in your private life which means that education as a foundational system is crucial.
Given that it is so crucial and given that people are forced to be through education systems in the united states for twelve years and in other areas for and other developed countries approximately the same amount of time, we think that it's preferable for individuals to have choice over that education.
We think that parents ultimately have a better understanding of the type of education that is required for their children to succeed than the government does and given that that's the case we think that private education allows for more options.
It allows for different types of educational styles that parents can choose from.
What we see with private education is a few things.
We think you get more innovation in how you teach because when you have public education you often have regulations that are dictated from state or federal levels which constrain what you can do in the classroom.
They constraint how you can teach, they constrain what you can teach, they constrain what the classroom itself looks like.
Private education allows for people to make those decisions on their own.
You can go to a system in which stem education is preferred in which your child is going to spend the vast amount of their time in stem classes.
You can put your child in a private school in which religion is part of the educational system in which a child of a religious family is able to attain the religious education that is essential in the eyes of their parents.
It also means that people can go to schools in which you have different settings for the classroom where you spend most of your time in the outdoors or you go on trips.
These are all things that allow for more individual learning and as we learn more and more about how people educate themselves, what becomes more apparent is that one method of education does not work for everyone.
That people learn in a variety of different ways and we think that private education allows for people to have more choice that aligns better with how they learn and what they need to learn.
So given that that is the case, we think more choice is what private education offers and that is always on good.
The second reason why private education brings more good than harm is that it provides competition for public schools.
Recognize that without private education the only provider of education would be the state which means that the state would automatically get the money that people put in through taxes, that the state would automatically get control over the children's education, would automatically would automatically have control over all these years without any sort of competition that ensures that they're doing a good job.
Yes parents can complain and they can vote elected officials out, but ultimately we think this has very little impact on the educational system itself.
It has very little impact on federal and state regulations and things of the like.
Given that this is the case we think that private education means that a flight of money, of teachers, of administrators, is all likely to happen if a school simply does not succeed.
If a school doesn't provide the basic necessities for their students and when this is the case it means that in areas where schools are already failing, there are alternate options that people can choose to turn to and it means that schools, public schools, need to continue to evolve.
They need to continue to innovate and continue to improve their standing in order to compete for the best teachers and the best administrators and in order to stay open because just because they're publicly run doesn't mean that these schools don't have an incentive, a desire to maintain their to maintain their school and to keep their doors open.
Given that private education is an option that allows for more choices and provides competition that we think raises the bar of education for everyone in the school system not just those that can afford private education, we think that private education brings more good than harm not only for those that go to these private schools but also in public schools."
"We should end affirmative action.
So, when we're talking about ending affirmative action, we're talking about it in all spectrums of the way it comes.
There's affirmative action that can be required in hiring, especially on the federal and state level.
There's affirmative action that can come to getting people into higher education.
We're going to say: end it all.
End affirmative action in all stages.
We've two main arguments to support ending affirmative action.
The first is about why the state is built to build upon a system of equality of opportunity, not necessarily an equality of end points, and the second is that we think it degrades the accomplishments of people in the status quo who are said to have only being gotten to their position because they are either I'm a minority or some other subjected group who's getting benefits of affirmative action.
We think that's problematic, and we think it leads to more vitriol moving forward.
So, those two arguments.
First, on equality of opportunity.
We think the state exists primarily to uphold negative freedoms.
If the state were not to exist, if there was no state and we lived in a state of nature, we think the most fundamental thing that we would lose is our security, our freedom to behave in ways that we see fit, that are are that are an expression of our preferences.
And so the state exists to to create that apparatus in which all people can live, all people can express their liberty equally.
We think the goal of this is to provide equal opportunity, an equal starting point to all people to express their preferences and their freedoms.
But under that state, a state of equality of opportunity, we don't think that you're going to necessarily end up with similar end points.
We think, on the contrary, you're likely to end up with vastly different end points for vastly different people.
We think that affirmative action oversteps these types of ends.
Affirmative action is an ends-based system.
It prefers creating ends for some people that create the illusion of solvency and the illusion of an equality of opportunity.
We think that affirmative action is primarily a bandaid solution that attempts to solve for the inefficiencies of creating that equal starting point for people.
It recognizes that we don't have a state in the status quo where there's a quality of opportunity and therefore, instead of trying to solve that and trying instead of trying to create a system that actually provides an equal footing for all people, it creates some better ends for a few people by creating arbitrary distinctions and elevating the few, when it leaves the vast majority from those same groups of people behind.
So, secondly, we think it degrades the the accomplishments of minorities, and it degrades the accomplishments of people that gain benefits of affirmative action.
Recognize that in the status quo, affirmative action is incredibly politically volatile.
It gives the excuse to people who are of the opinion that minorities didn't earn what they had coming to them, that this is the case and that they only gain those benefits because the government chose to help them.
This plays off the absolute worst stereotypes that we have in our society about people that gain the benefits of affirmative action.
In those minds of the people that already hold those opinions, it dramatically entrenches those views and says that not only are these people getting special benefit, but they're getting special benefit at the cost of my own.
This means that it increases the anger and resentment that exists between these communities, again, only to serve as a bandaid solution, because we couldn't actually take the steps to create a system where there's equal opportunity for all.
We think this dramatically decreases the political will to take those steps that actually solve for the most people when there's resentment and anger between these groups.
And it's founded upon the reality that certain groups were given special benefits and special treatment because of who they were and how they were born.
We think that this makes it much less likely that you can have popular popular solutions and popular popular approval for solutions like increasing funding for school systems amongst disenfranchised groups, for housing amongst disenfranchised groups, to giving to those that are actually suffering the benefits they need to create a better foundation for themselves.
For these reasons, we should end affirmative action."
"We should privatize the national parks.
So, we think that the way that this privatization would likely work is not just to sell the land that currently exists for national parks.
No, we're going to keep national parks existing as they are, but we're going to give contracts to different companies to run those national parks, to private actors, that they can bid, they can offer their services at a certain fee, those services can be assessed, and then we can as a the government can then give those contracts to whom they deem most worthy.
We think you're going to have to maintain the same standards of preservation.
There's still going to be government oversight to ensure that private actors are behaving appropriately but we think, overall, privatization would do immense good for national parks, firstly, because privatization breeds competition.
In order to obtain government contracts, private firms need to be both efficient and low cost, because if you do the job at a lower cost and at a higher efficiency, you stand out from other firms that you're competing against.
This means that there's also an incentive to get more people into these parks in order to profit.
If you have more people coming to these parks paying some small fee, we think that it's more likely that you as a firm will profit, which means that you're incentivized to do things like advertising parks that are less well-known.
It's you're more likely to do things like try and get people to use underutilized resources.
And, yes, while parks like the grand canyon national park in yosemite are visited by millions of people each year, there are thousands of national parks within the united states, and the vast majority of them are very rarely used, are very rarely visited.
We think that parks are currently being underutilized.
We want people to spend more time in these areas, to take advantage of them, because it's not just the ability to escape into nature and to get more in touch with our natural environment, to see the beauty of the world that exists around us, but it's also to take advantage of historic sites.
Many national parks exist as historic locations, and these are and these are areas in which people can learn about their history.
They can have a better understanding of the past.
They can grow more connected with their ancestors.
We think that all of these have a general benefit to people's well-being, to their knowledge, to their empathy, and to their understanding of the world they live in.
We think there are also a number of issues with the status quo that would likely be solved by public firms: firstly, the crumbling infrastructure that exists in many national parks.
As I mentioned, these are often historic sites, and these historic sites need to be preserved.
It's not just protecting the environment, but it's also protecting certain monuments, certain structures.
We think that private actors are more likely to put in the work that's needed to fix these crumbling infrastructure, because if you have crumbling infrastructure, no one is going to want to come to your park.
If you if you can't sell something to the public, then there's nothing that you can advertise.
There's no way to get a profit off of what you're doing and because of that, we think that these things are more likely to be kept up in high condition.
You also see a system in the status quo that has increased pollution and increased water pollution, in particular, but again, keeping pristine nature of these national parks makes your park more attractive.
It makes it more likely that people are going to want to come to these areas.
And so, again, private actors are incentivized to protect these things in a way that government actors are not.
At the end of the day, private actors have a profit margin that they are concerned with that the government simply does not.
The government does not run national parks seeking to make a profit, but these firms would.
And in order to make a profit, you need to fix the harms that currently exist, you need to do it at a lower cost.
And you have many firms that are willing to take on this burden, which means you have lower costs overall that the government is spending and better quality of parks for all.
For these reasons, we should privatize the national parks."
"We should subsidize renewable energy and we should subsidize renewable energy because renewable energy is just an incredibly good thing for many reasons.
And subsidies are a good way to effectively get more of that good thing.
So first why is renewable energy a good thing?
The biggest reason is climate change.
We live in a world in which climate change is going to have incredibly horrible impacts if we don't rapidly decrease the amount of CO two and other other greenhouse gas emissions that we put into the atmosphere.
And one of the biggest ways in which we emit greenhouse gases is with non renewable energies.
So whether it's the oil from our car or the coal that we burned for electricity or basic refrigeration and cooling and things like that that require that require like electricity and things like that to run.
All of these things require a large amount of non renewable energy which gets funneled into the atmosphere and all of that can be corrected with green energy.
And that's huge because without more of the impacts of climate change you're talking about multibillion dollar costs of like essentially things like flooding and natural disasters obviously crop failures and things like that are obviously problems as well there's a whole lot of problems that are going to come with climate change both economic costs and real human cost that can be avoided with these kinds of things.
But secondarily even if that's not true they're still going to be a need for this there's going to be a need for renewable energy because there's going to be an increase in scarcity of non renewable resources and the biggest reason for that is just because we've been reliant on nonrenewable energy for so long consuming it at such fast rates that it can't possibly keep up with the that the the rate at which it rebuilds over like tens of thousands of years isn't able to keep up with the rate at which we're consuming it so eventually it's all going to be gone.
And that's going to be a big deal and that we're going to need to do something about that and plan in advance.
But finally I think it's going to be better for pricing and the economy in the long run and that's true because the scarcity obviously of non renewable energies is going to lead to a rise in it.
This is something that we've already seen like oil is so much more expensive than it used to be because oil is not is like as widely abundant as it used to be.
We're not there's more of a stricter supply of oil.
So we're already seeing this kind of basic economic principle happen.
And I think this is only going to get worse because because the things that I've talked about.
So then when you compare that to greenhouse gases you're talking about things that can be done incredibly cheaply and efficiently in the long run whether it's just putting up a panel and taking in sunlight not having to worry about a whole lot of various costs that are related to nonrenewable energy production in the long run green technologies and renewable energies are going to be a whole lot cheaper.
So I think that subsidies are an incredibly good way to get more of this good thing.
They're a good way to get more of this good thing because there subsidies are going to directly increase investment in it whether you're a researcher or developer getting an investment or you're a consumer that's getting some kind of subsidies for doing some kind of consumers related subsidy.
This is obviously going to increase the prevalence of renewable energy which is great.
But also this is going to lead to a signaling effect and a snowball effect because the more people that are encouraged to use renewable energies the more widely normalize it's going to be and also there's going to be greater economies of scale because when things like production plants for cars are now focusing on electric cars instead of oil based cars and it becomes cheaper to produce what it becomes cheaper to produce the renewable alternatives.
And that basic economic principle can be expanded over a whole lot of other things.
So for all those reasons definitely subsidize renewable energy."
"We should limit campaign finance.
Our model for this is really simple: we would just put a limit on the fundraising amounts that each candidate running for public office can have as well as an individual limit on how much a single entity can give.
We're fine with ironing out the details of how much this amount is going to be later, the point is just that we think such limits should exist where they currently do not.
So we don't want like national grid to be giving something like millions and millions of dollars to one candidate in order to pay them off.
Like that's the world we're trying to avoid.
So, clearly, these would be reasonable limits.
Like you can still fundraise some, you can still get a good amount of money to fund your campaign, but we just don't want money to play as large of a role as it does in the status quo.
Two main arguments, first on preventing corruption.
When you allow unlimited contributions to campaign finance, you invite special interests into the election and into the government.
This is bad because it skews the priorities of public officials.
Where they should be protecting and promoting the interests of the people, allowing them to receive money from corporations creates an incentive to trade their political capital for that money and support.
This creates a world in which the priorities of public officials stop being the public and start being the corporations that fund them, which is incredibly undemocratic and basically flies in the face of everything that our democracy and elections themselves need to stand for.
It also just means that you don't have people's best interests at heart anymore, so you can't rely on the government to protect people in the same way that they should be.
So then it becomes really unclear as to why people are willing to give up their rights to the government in the first place if the government isn't going to do a good job of protecting them.
We don't think it's worth with flirting we don't think it's worth flirting with the possibility of corruption.
Insofar as unlimited campaign finances are always going to have more of a risk for corruption than limited ones, we think this is already reason enough to vote for government's side.
Like, at the point that money like we know that money definitively can corrupt individuals, we just don't think there's a good reason on side opposition as to why you shouldn't limit them, like insofar as everyone's going to have the same amount of money anyway, which brings us to our second argument about maintaining a level playing field.
We want candidates to get elected because they are the best, not because they have a bunch of money to pay off advertising advertising companies and lie to the general population through the media.
There's a problem in the status quo where some candidates automatically have a much higher probability of election because they will receive tons of money from large corporations in exchange for their cooperation.
This allows them to then do things with that money, like engage in mudslinging and media advertising.
It lets them use those corporations to win votes in areas that are dependent on those corporations.
And it basically just lets them do all of these kinds of things that the other candidates can't, because the other candidates are limited by that money when they refuse to take from special interests and they refuse to like, in the future, vote for their for things and like support those special interests.
We want to even that playing field.
You shouldn't be punished for not being corrupt.
If all candidates have the same general amount of money, the disparity and the differences they can make with that money are much smaller.
Like in the status quo, you can literally have candidates who, because they have no money from large conglomerates, just can't afford to put their image out there at all, sitting right across from candidates that have billions of dollars to play with when they are like constructing their campaign.
And it means that those people don't get defined by their policies as much as they're being defined by their tactics and their lack of money, which is really bad, because there might be tons of people who agree with their policies but they never even get to hear them properly, because of the fact that they're being blocked out by the money coming in from these special interests.
So, basically, we just think we're creating a completely better and different democracy when we limit campaign finance.
Proud to propose."
"High school should be mandatory.
We're going to tell you why high school, or secondary school for those following from outside the states, should be required for everyone in your country.
Our first argument is that there is basic knowledge conveyed in secondary school that everyone needs to have to be a functional member of society.
As one example, no one has access to civics classes before their secondary education or maybe they do in some countries, but very few, because people when they're eleven or twelve, before they start their secondary education, can't really appreciate things like understanding how their country's system of government works and why it works the way it does, and that's an important part of being an informed citizen.
We think that keeping students up to the point when they're able to think like an adult, in their mid-to-late teens, is important so that we can teach them things that adults need to know, such as how their country operates and why it is that way, so that we can teach them uncomfortable parts of your country's history so that they're able to vote in a more informed fashion.
If, for instance, you didn't have mandatory secondary school in america, many people would probably leave their education and never learn about the extermination of the native americans, because it's seean as something inappropriate or that younger students aren't able to learn about until they reach secondary school.
So you would have lots of people voting who lack even the most basic amount of historical or civic knowledge.
And I want you to think about what the average voter in your country is like, and you might not have the highest opinion of their level of information that they use to make decisions when they vote, imagine if that person couldn't name six of your heads of states in your country's history or tell you what the type of parliament your country has is.
Like there is a basic level of knowledge you only get in secondary school, and we think everyone needs to have that before they can vote.
Our second argument, setting aside this thing about citizens, is to turn to how this affects people as laborers.
Almost every job requires skills that you don't learn until secondary school.
Even very low-skilled jobs, like being a cashier, still require that you're able to do basic algebra, and that you're able to make change, and that you're able to fill in a form and use a computer, and these are all things that a lot of people don't learn until early secondary school or, at the very least, that they get much better at in secondary school.
So we think that if you have people leaving the education system before they've been to secondary school, it will be very hard for them to get any sort of job.
This has two harms: one, people are harming themselves for the rest of their lives because they don't get an education, and two, they're hurting your entire country because they're not contributing to the economy.
You might say, "" oh, well, that should be up to individuals, "" but if people don't contribute to the economy, that limits your country's development, that limits your country's future potential, and we think that that is a concern for the state and for the community as a whole.
And our final argument is that, ultimately, people aren't able to make good decisions at the age when they would be quitting secondary school.
There's a reason why we don't let fifteen and sixteen-year-olds vote.
There's a reason why most impactful decisions require a parent's consent.
No one is making a good choice if they leave secondary school, it's just going to prevent them from getting any sort of job in the future.
So this isn't rational.
So anyone who is making this decision is making the wrong decision, and they're making it because they're at an age when they think that they know better than other people and that they're going to go make lots of money as an athlete, or a musician, or whatever silly thing sixteen-year-olds are trying to do.
So we need to protect people from making bad decisions when they're at this very impressionable age.
And I think that in the same way that we protect people from making bad decisions about smoking or driving when they're underage, we need to protect them from dropping out of school.
Thank you."
"We should absolutely further exploit green technology.
Because, global warming is a threat not just in the narrow sense, it's not just a threat in that we have to cut co2 emissions from our cars, it's not a threat in that we have to use more renewable sources of energy, or not cut down so many habitats.
It's more , it's more broad in the fact that every aspect of our daily lives in various ways needs to change in order to make sure that we can actually the earth is livable in the future, because the earth is in danger.
So, I think that in order to make sure that this happens, we need to have a wide range of solutions and a wide range of technologies.
So this is where I think that green technology comes in and why it's important that we further exploit it.
Way I think that the first way in which umm green technology can actually directly help umm combat climate change, is that it can help in , just the technology of doing things like maybe purifying water in a better way so you can you saltwater instead of having to access like draining water out of like lakes and things like that.
Maybe you could be automatic switches for turning off lights when you're not there, maybe it could be things like that to monitor over used, maybe it could be other things like improvements on the way we heat efficiently, or on the sources of heat that we use altogether that could be done more efficiently.
I think that all of these things can be incredibly helpful, and one of the biggest reasons why, is because I think that people are going to be very unwilling.
Even though it's required that people change the way they're actually living their lives, it's going to be very difficult to persuade people to actually change their lives.
So because of that, you want to make sure that the transition can be smooth as possible, and that's why having good technologies that can exist as replacements is important.
So this is why for example if you know that meat consumption is incredibly bad in what it does for the environment and you wanna replace it, you're not gonna get people to stop eating meat.
So what you want to do is you want to create the best like replacement item possible so that people may not even be able to tell the difference.
So if maybe you can use chemical engineering to create synthetic meat or something like that that tastes good, people would be willing to not eat meat, and that would be good for the environment.
Things like this, these are direct solutions that can have massive impacts, but these solutions require money, and the reason they require money is because people just aren't always willing to donate enough because people can be economically shortsighted at times.
People are just willing to spend the money on the thing that's already available, and when a lot of people are already getting into that or it's already existed for a while, economies of scale and things exist, it's very easy to keep relying on the mechanisms that you already have.
This is why I think that green technology plays a very important role in ultimately spearheading the kinds of switches that we can get.
So, all of that is true and all of that is important, and a reason why it's important is because of the degree to which climate change is an actual threat.
Because recognize that, if we have inherently fragile resources, scarce resource, things like access to fresh water, things like what we use for fuel, those things are scarce and when we over use them, then we're in a very bad situation.
But also more directly than that, we also see the impacts of global warming manifests itself in natural disasters.
You could have like , more hurricanes than ever, historical heat waves or historical blizzards, you could have earthquakes that happen from things like fracking, you could have flooding and starvation from temperature fluctuations and icebergs melting.
All of these are directly attributable to global warming, and all of this, which is the worst things, the worst impacts that we could have, all of this can be ameliorated if we invest more in green technology.
So for all of those reasons, very proud to propose."
"We should support a phaseout of lightweight plastic bags.
So, let's be clear: the bags that we're talking about are the bags that we all know, when we go to the grocery store, when we go to a supermarket, when we go out and about to the mall and we buy something, you get those plastic bags that are relatively that are lightweight, that don't have long shelf lives, and that you generally just use for throwing out garbage on a weekly basis.
So, why is it important to get get rid of these lightweight plastic bags?
So, firstly, it's important to recognize the problem that they cause, because plastic bags are not biodegradable.
Plastics do not compose for a very long period of time and, like I said, these plastic bags are largely just ended up being used for throwing trash out, which means that you have tons and tons of plastic pouring into landfills or being thrown onto the streets, because no one needs the plastic bag for their soda that they bought at the seven eleven, and it means that more and more pollution is going out there.
And this pollution has dramatic harms on our environment.
It means that our water is less clean.
It means that animals are being harmed by these things, which hurts the biodiversity of the spheres that we live in, and it leads to a problem of increased pollution which continually drives continually drives our harms in our environment.
And also, it takes a lot of of fossil fuels to create these plastic bags.
The production of these plastic bags in and of itself increases the amount of pollutants that are going into the air, and because they're not reusable in a meaningful sense, because the average the lightweight plastic bag that you get from the store maybe has a couple of uses before it starts to tear and you have to throw it out anyway, this is a product that is constantly being that constantly needs to be reproduced, which means that every every time that you have to put more fossil fuels into the production process, this isn't a a one-time process, this is a process that's repeating over and over again in people's daily lives.
And they're not very versatile, these bags.
You can't use them for anything particularly heavy because they're not very reusable.
You can't use them , you know, as like a backpacker.
You can't use them as something that you would have in your everyday life.
It's something that is likely just going to be used for either throwing trash out, or being used for small tasks, or thrown in a closet somewhere never to be used again.
And the issue with this is that maybe this would be acceptable if lightweight plastic bags were the only option, but easy alternatives exist and are, in fact, already produced to a fairly high level.
There's a few things that are being done right now.
For example, in most grocery stores, you can buy a a hemp bag or you can buy a bag that was made to be reused.
You can buy a regular grocery bag that you can just take to the store with you on a regular basis.
It's this is a a significant improvement over lightweight plastic bags because even if there is some sort of harm in the production process, you don't have the pollution of those bags being littered in landfills and across across wilderness and harming our environment, but you also don't have the increase, the repetitive production of fossil fuels.
And these and these are relatively cheap things to buy.
If I go to my local grocery store, I can buy one of these for a couple of bucks.
And, yes, this may be a small a small issue for people in their daily lives.
Once you buy this thing, if you buy two or three or four, you're set for probably a number of years before you need to buy a replacement, because they're made to be reusable.
They're made to carry heavier weight.
You can use them in your day-to-day life.
You can use them to carry things around that aren't just lightweight groceries, because they're able to be because they're more durable.
And this means that you have a product that is relatively cheap, that's something that everyone can buy.
It's something that doesn't create as much pollution, and it doesn't create as much waste in the production process, and it's easy to distribute because these these stores already are producing these things.
They're already available for people.
They're already encouraging for people to use these things, and it's just a matter of phasing out the plastic bags and shifting more people to these reusable bags that they can purchase at most any store.
For these reasons, we should support a phaseout of lightweight plastic bags."
"We should cancel the speed limit.
So by this we mean to say that on highways government should not set a maximum speed at which people are permitted to drive.
So we imagine a model similar to certain structures of the autobahn in germany where people are permitted to drive as quickly as they wish according to what's safe for their individual car.
I'd like to point out that we're not advocating for some sort of mad max state of anarchy on our side.
If you're driving at an unsafe fashion on the autobahn, you can still be pulled over.
So I don't expect to see grandmas and toyotas going a hundred and fifty miles an hour.
I think that people will probably drive more quickly than they do now, but still in a fundamentally safe fashion, and that the police will be able to correct for it if they're not.
With that in mind, three arguments.
The first is that speed limits are fundamentally arbitrary.
Everyone listening to this has probably at some point driven on a road and wondered, why is the speed limit here so low?
We see that oftentimes speed limits are not set with regard for how windy or straight a road is, or how easy it is to drive on, rather every road in a certain area has the same speed limit, or every highway has the same speed limit in a certain state or province.
At that point, when the speed limit isn't based on anything in reality but rather some arbitrary law, people break them all the time.
Where I live in boston, people regularly drive twenty miles over the speed limit around this in the interstates around the city, and the police don't do anything about it because everyone knows it's safe to drive much faster than the speed limit.
What this means is that people feel resentment when the law is actually enforced.
Because any enforcement is uneven.
In other words, the police generally pull you over because they have to fill a quota for the month of tickets that they write, or because they want to get you for something else and it's an excuse that they can use.
So this leads to people having less faith in the system as a whole.
Almost every american has probably had negative interactions with a police officer because they were speeding and got pulled over even though they were driving in a completely safe fashion.
So we think that this leads to worse relationships between people and law enforcement, and that furthermore any contact between individuals and law enforcement is an opportunity for things like police brutality and violence in countries like the US, where the police carry guns.
With this in mind, we should cancel the speed limit because it's arbitrary and there are many harmful effects about arbitrariness.
Our second argument is that speed limits don't change over time in a suitable fashion.
Fifty years ago it's probably true that cars should be limited to a hundred kilometers an hour or whatever they're limited to on highways near you.
Because people didn't wear seat belts, because cars were slower and bigger, but nowadays cars are much safer because of crash test safety ratings.
And on top of that we see that people wear seat belts, that they have things like curtain airbags, and that ultimately cars are much safer.
But speed limits don't go up because of lobbying groups, like mothers against drunk driving in the united states, or because of a lack of desire to actually do anything about the problem in other places.
So we tell you at that point that because speed limits are set at one time and then never updated to reflect realities, once more people are willing to break them and all the harms I just discussed come in once more.
So at the end of the day we should get rid of speed limits because they aren't adjusted accurately over time and they don't reflect what is actually safe.
Our third argument is that rather than using speed limits we should take increasing advantage of governors.
Every car sold in the united states is required to be limited to a certain maximum speed, I think it's about a hundred and forty five miles per hour.
Many cars for instance that are imported from japan are not road legal in america because they don't have a governor or because they're faster than that.
What we tell you is that if you set governors at a lower setting, then it would be easy to let people drive as quickly as they want and set a maximum speed that's appropriate for their car.
So perhaps if you drive an audi you would be allowed dry faster than someone who drives a honda, but everyone would be governed to go the maximum speed that's appropriate for their car.
We think that would be more fair and ultimately less arbitrary.
For these reasons we should cancel the speed limit.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should introduce goal-line technology.
What we mean by this is that we would mandate that all levels of the game above those played for children below the ages of probably sixteen to like anything above the high school, middle school elementary school level would require the use of goal-line technology.
With that two main areas of clash, first on sticking to the spirit of the game.
Recognize that fairness is one of the most important things in a game insofar as it allows individual players to play the game and like play you to the fullest extent because they know or have a belief that the system is going to be fair to them.
No one is going to engage in a sport or an activity where they know they are doomed to fail and people get bored easily if they know they are doomed to win.
But even if you don't buy that individual players require fairness to exist, it's really important for fans as well in order to enjoy the sport.
The only reason that sports exist are because people like them whether it's playing them or watching them and the way in which both players and fans get enjoyment out of it is by the knowledge that referees can be trusted and that individual players are relying on their skill to win a game and not just whether or not the referee likes them or whether or not they're like in a particular bracket and they've been like paid off to lose or win.
So when a game is unfair the players' skills undermined and both the players and the fans are unhappy.
Goal-line technology is an incredibly easy solution to maintaining the integrity of the game and it also maintains the speed of the game which we think is also an element that individuals really appreciate when it comes to sports.
Insofar as one of the reasons that I want to go to sports games for that rush of adrenaline to keep up with it so I think that the speed is actually very integral to like why we enjoy sports and why sports as an institution are like agreeable as well.
Instant replay which is the current technology to check grey-area goals takes a really long time to go through and pauses the game significantly, during which time fans get bored players like get out of their adrenaline rush and we really think that like all in all it doesn't benefit anyone because one minute of game can take over twenty minutes to analyze by instant replay.
And we think a really solution for that really easy solution for that is goal-line technology that just kind of indicates whether or not the line was line was crossed.
We think that it's a really easy solution.
But our second area of clash is the way in which it interacts positively with referees.
First in assisting the good ones.
Recognize that this technology doesn't make referees obsolete.
Refs are still needed to oversee the rest of the game and make the obvious calls or the ones that they're certain about.
But this is assists in times when it seems like there is a gray area.
This is better than both the human eye and video playback insofar as both of those still depend on the perspective of the individual viewing them or the perspective of where the camera is placed and because the ball often overshadows the line you can never see if it definitively cost center or not.
Like maybe it's three quarters of the way through as compared to one half and it's really difficult to discern with like any version that relies on the human being to see it.
We think that whether or not a team gets a point should not depend on the angle and distance of the referee.
We also think that it allows good referees to maintain their integrity in situations where the fans might be yelling oh no well like we really think this is crooked this is a really easy way in which you can check against that and allow referees to say look I'm not lying like clearly and we think that casting doubt on a referee's call is a really easy way to take away the like integrity of that team or that referee and so we think that creating mechanisms that can check fans against like good referees and make sure that no one is like being is like ruining someone's reputation for no reason is really positive.
But we also think that it provides a meaningful check against bad referees because bad referees either because they have poor eyesight or because they're like they're crooked or because they're biased against a team exist and this makes sure that they can't get away with making calls that impact the game during their time as referees and so we think that it's like very positive when you have a failsafe metric that like allows us to eliminate human error.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should ban homeopathy.
In times when societies are massively misinformed by fake news sites perpetuated on social media, or bubbles don't allow people to to, receive alternative points of view to inform them, we think it's important that in this time in particular government stepped forward to make sure that there is an informed citizenry.
Not only because it's good for people's individual health, but because it's also good for the collective communal health and for the costs that are associated with that healthcare and up-keep, we think it's important that homeopathy is bad.
Recognize that there is no meaningful scientific research to support homeopathy as a real way to cure any sort of ailment.
Curing ailments through homeopathy is just as effective as taking sugar pills and being lied to and told that it's actually aspirin or something of the like.
It's simply a product of the placebo effect and nothing more than that.
So there's no healthcare reason why individuals should be able to take this stance.
It's only the only feasible reason why individual should be able to use homeopathy, is because they are free to do with their body what they will.
But we don't think that this freedom is permanent.
We don't think that people can do anything with their body when it has an impact on those around them, nor do we think that other people can be told what to do with their body, especially when it has negative healthcare consequences.
So why should we ban homeopathy?
First and foremost, when people are misinformed we think they make poor decisions that impact their health.
Just because homeopathy has no scientific basis to show that it works doesn't mean that people don't believe that it does.
And while people may be afraid of traditional medicine, when they think the comparisons between traditional medicine, which may work but is also scary and they don't understand it, and homeopathy which is supported by voodoo science, where people think there are no negative side effects and it's an entirely natural and something that your body is more easily able to take in, but also effective, we think that they're making a choice between two false options.
Things that are drastically not correct and that can't be properly weighed for the individual in making their decision.
Furthermore, it's important to recognize that when homeopathy is allowed and allowed to be credited as something that people can do to treat themselves, this has impacts on what parents can do for their children.
For example, the parents believe that it's bad for you to take traditional medicine but that homeopathy works well, children can be exposed to a lack of vaccinations and other medications that can be crucial for their health.
And children don't have a meaningful choice over whether or not they're going to do this nor do they have a choice of whether or not they're going to be inculcated into this false belief.
Which means that in this particular relationship when you allow homeopathy, not only does it mean that health of the child is harmed in the short run, and possibly in the long run if major steps aren't taken to prevent really dangerous diseases like cancer and other things that can be life threatening, but it also means that if that child survives and is able to continue on in their life, it's going to be much more difficult for them to learn that homeopathy is not effective and to make decisions moving forward that would be the most healthy for them.
So, those are ways in which individuals both on their own level and in their relations with others use homeopathy to harm themselves and those around them even if they may not be doing it intentionally.
The other reason why we should ban homeopathy is because when people do get sick because they choose not to get actual medication, and rather choose to use homeopathy, those medical costs still accrue and people are still forced to pay those medical costs.
It's just that the people that are sick don't pay these medical costs themselves, those costs get passed on to the public.
So when someone is ill in the united states and they go to the hospital or in many other developed countries, and they can't pay those bills because they don't have insurance, or because they waited too long and the decease got too powerful for them to to get a simple cure to, those costs get passed on to the taxpayer and the taxpayer then, through programs like medicare and medicaid and other and other sorts of subsidies, are forced to pay those costs moving forward.
So we think that from a simple economics base it's important to ban homeopathy.
Because we think there would be a massive reduction in costs in the medical service, in the medical program that are borne by the public in general, and given that when someone is making a choice that they often don't realize is a bad choice or they're not informed enough to make meaningful choice, we don't think that stripping them them off that autonomy in that way, especially when they're broader societal and beneficial social impacts that come from banning homeopathy as well as economic impacts, we don't think it's stripping them from a meaningful use of their bodily autonomy, and because of that we think that we should ban homeopathy."
"Big governments are advantageous.
So we think that there are three reasons why in comparison to smaller government systems big governments are good.
Firstly, big governments are entities that are existing simply for the public interest but they're able to to combat large private corporations.
So recognize that is incredibly difficult for individuals or small communities to combat large corporations whether this be utility corporations, oil corporations, large multinational businesses that in a number of ways can abuse both consumers and communities.
Given that this is the case, we think that big governments because they have both the legal backing and the justification of their existence is the state, but also they have a vast amount of economic and social resources that can be levied against abusers of private power.
What this means is that when you big governance it's less it's less possible for large corporations and large entities to abuse the people within that state because there's a check that exists only for the public good.
When this is the case in comparison to small governments who have less resources and less social capital these these groups can be abused.
This is why small countries that exist are often abused by large corporations when planning infrastructure projects and things like that, because they simply don't have the capital both economically or politically to combat these abuses.
Secondly, large government means more social spending.
When you have a large government it means that it means that you are more able to draw in the resources from your from your constituents.
It means that you have the apparatus that is more able to collect taxes.
That it also means that you have the arms of the apparatus, the tools of the apparatus are more diverse which means you can do more social good.
When you have a small limited government there are less fields that you can enter because you simply don't have the manpower to do good work.
Social needs occur in a vast amount of ways whether it be public health, public safety, public transportation.
All these are things that are necessary both for the market system to survive but also for individuals to flourish, and as this is the case, we think larger governments are able to diversify more.
This means that these governments are able to provide social goods to these people on a more direct scale and it also means that you can ensure that people are able to better fulfill their desires, to have the infrastructure, the social infrastructure that is necessary to do the things that would bring them fulfillment.
It also means that you're more able to do things like have welfare spending when you have a government that is able to tax at a higher rate, when you have a government that's less restrained by the restrictions of a tax base it means that you can provide redistribution of economic of economic goods within a society and it means that the people on the ground can get those goods better, which means you have better redistribution of resources and a more fair redistribution of resources when you have big governments.
Finally, we think that you have more participation in government when you have a big government.
This is for two reasons.
First, you have greater need for employees which means that the bureaucracy of the government is larger and it means that more people are employed within that work.
We think that this is good firstly, because it provides jobs and opportunities for advancement and good pay for people that exist within the state to do honest work.
To do things that exist to help their communities.
To help the people within their society broadly but secondly, we think it gets more people engaged.
When the government is more active socially, when it's more active in the community and it's more visible, it gets more people to understand what the government does and it makes it more likely that people are going to interact with that government and have a desire to become part of the political discourse that is ongoing.
When the government is small, people are less aware of what the government is is doing and they have less interest in the discourse that surrounds it but that discourse is crucial for not only guiding how the government is going to behave, but for understanding the society that we live in, and for growing as a community, and growing as a society.
Because of these three reasons we think that big governments are advantageous."
"We should ban male infant circumcision.
Our model be fairly clear.
We will make it illegal for a man under the age of consent to an elective circumcision.
That is to say, if they want to get a circumcision they will have to wait until they are an adult to actually meaningfully be able to consent to it.
Three arguments for why this is a good idea.
First is about bodily autonomy.
We believe there exists a basic negative right to bodily autonomy.
Any and all rights that we want to give to anyone come from the ability to do what they want with their body.
Why is this the case?
Individuals cannot exercise any of their rights without a body and without control of that body.
Secondly though, we think that given that this is the case we must hold any warrant for violation of the body to a high standard.
For instance, we don't mandate that everyone give up their kidney even if there's a societal benefit to mandating that donation because we believe that individuals ought to be to define how their body is used.
It is because we recognize that individuals have control over this fundamental right.
We would further say that governments have a special obligation to protect the autonomy of children.
Governments have an expressed interest in protecting children in so far as children are wards of the state and are generally protected through our policies.
This demonstrates how we don't give parents a hundred percent of the rights over their children.
Our standard for this is fairly simple.
The rights of parents stop when harm is done to bodily autonomy without any kind of medical necessity.
We would say that child abuse laws prevent these violations.
As they say I can't cut my own child's arm off because they have the right to define it for themselves and control it later on.
Circumcision clearly violates the bodily autonomy of the child because it is a forced removal of the foreskin that violates their body as such, it should be illegal.
We would also say that there are clear medical harm of circumcision.
Surgical procedures have inherent risks of infection and other complications.
We would say that we should always default to not having surgery whenever possible as it can lead to permanent disfigurement and permanent pain.
Secondly though, we think that it's generally not recommended by the american medical association and other medical establishments.
Very clearly doctors do not think it's an inherently good idea and have generally cautioned against it.
Our second argument though, is about societal harms because we think that male circumcision makes it hard to talk about things like female genital mutilation when you allow it.
You open the door to a whole litany of harms when you have an arbitrary standard that is not enforced by government.
The question of what is and isn't a legitimate mutilation is blurred by this asinine standard that allows some mutilations and not others.
The idea that circumcision results in good cultural outcomes for jews doesn't mean it warrants an exception under the laws against bodily harms.
We would say that the same faulty standard could be applied to other practices that are inherently problematic even just because the religion defines it doesn't mean that there's an inherent right to it.
Secondly though, we think this materializes into concrete harms.
We think that when the law is arbitrary, is inherently unfair and there are more likely to be violators.
We believe that there is more crime from believers in things like FGM who come here and see the unclear standard.
We think that there's an impact of this insofar as we get increased violators of female genital mutilation laws when circumcision is legal.
Without a legal justification of why one practice is allowed and another practice is not allowed, individuals will always do it.
Furthermore, we think that there is the inherent harm of preferring one religion over another.
We can't have arbitrary standards when it comes to the first amendment particularly in regards to religion.
It's a huge violation when the government quite literally prefers one religion over another.
Why is a jewish justification for violating a child's body okay but other justifications are inherently not?
Quite simply the government cannot answer this question.
But finally though, we think of the fact the perception of society as a whole.
The government should not stand behind such inherent arbitrary standards.
Allowing this to take place hurts the legitimacy of government who are perceived as allowing harm to children to happen without any recourse.
For this reason, we should ban male infant circumcision."
"We should abolish no knock warrants.
So with a no knock warrant a judge effectively tells the police that they're allowed to enter someone's home or private property without alerting that person to their presence.
Usually in the united states the police have to knock on your door, say police, and wait for your permission to enter your home.
Or if they have probable cause, identify themselves, give you a reasonable chance to respond, before they enter your home without your permission.
No knock warrants are a more recent phenomenon which allow the police to knock down your door, shoot flash bangs into your house, and then come in as they wish.
So we're going to argue that these should be completely abolished.
Our first argument is that no knock warrants lead to more people being killed by the police.
Why is this true?
People don't have time to act rationally in the event of a no knock warrant.
Imagine you're just sitting at home in your house and you're some sort of petty criminal and suddenly a bunch of guys with guns run into your living room.
If you're armed, it seems quite likely to me that you won't even have time to process what's going on, you'll just react to defend yourself.
We think this is much more likely to lead to people being shot by the police.
And even if you're unarmed, you're much more likely to run, which could lead to your being shot or attacked because you're resisting arrest.
In the same way we tell you, that people are much more likely to suffer extreme property damage if they don't know that it's the police coming into their house the way they react might lead the police to do more damage to their house.
Things like knocking out windows and doors etcetera.
We think that people need to understand what's going on in order to react in an intelligent way and that you take away the ability for people to make that choice with a no knock warrant.
I realize that in theory these warrants are issued at times when the person wouldn't be someone who would react in the way we would like.
Someone like a drug dealer for instance.
But even those people deserve a chance to protect their life and their property and these no knock warrants infringe upon their ability to do so.
Our second argument is that no knock warrants are fundamentally unjust.
Why is this so?
People have a right to expectation of privacy in the united states.
This is a constitutionally guaranteed right that can't be taken away by any individual judge.
Yet obviously if the police can enter your home at anytime without your permission, your right to privacy is a figment of someone's imagination.
We tell you that ultimately while this may have been ruled constitutional, it seems contrary to the spirit of the law, which is to prevent the government from coming into your home or onto your property without permission.
We think that people can do many things that are distasteful but not illegal and they ought be allowed to do these things in the privacy of their own home without fearing some sort of government intervention.
But aside from that, we think that it's an instance of creeping police authority.
The police have an easier and easier time violating people's civil liberties because of judges issuing these warrants, and we think that this is part of a longer trend of the police becoming more militarized and more powerful compared to the people that they police.
Our third argument is that ultimately if you allow these no knock warrants they will be over used.
This should be really intuitive.
The police are ordinary people who go to work every day and do their job.
They don't want to do a harder job than they absolutely have to.
No knock warrants make things a lot easier for them.
If you have a no knock warrant, the police don't have to worry about getting shot at as much, they don't have to worry about the criminal escaping, ultimately they can just walk in there and take them without even having to announce that they're there.
So the police are always going to seek out these no knock warrants if they're able to do so.
And we've seen in the US that they've gone up in use year after year since they were first introduced.
Ultimately we think that the potential for abuse makes these really risky and that the police, for completely legitimate reasons, will seek to apply them even in cases when they're not strictly legal.
We think that with this in mind, the only policy that will prevent abuse is to ban them completely because they can't be used responsibly.
For these reasons we should abolish no knock warrants.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should introduce school vouchers � the way that we would model this is that every parent would be given one voucher per kid � this would be government provided and this culture would be used to send their child to any high school outside of the regional district.
Two main areas of clash.
The first on the rights of parents and children.
We think that it is generally accepted that parents have a right to manipulate.
It includes their children's environment in order to raise their children in the way that they like think they ought develop.
We think that in in parallel to this children also have a right to have access to wholesome education insofar as it defines what their future is going to be and whether or not they can actually move out of maybe their current financial bracket or be able to access better opportunities in the future.
The problem of limiting school these kind of vouchers provide a more specificity in choice and it allows parents to exercise more freedom with regards to how they want their children to develop and be raised.
The problem with limiting school districts per geography is that you're only limiting it for those who cannot afford to change their situation which means rich people have this right to manipulate their children's environment as they see fit but only those who cannot afford it cannot cannot actually like access this like better world.
If we don't like the is the district they're in richer parents can afford to send kids to private schools, hire tutors that can change their situations, but even if you don't buy that there's a right money is the most arbitrary way in which to separate who is deserving of a better education and who isn't.
People are born into arbitrary financial circumstances that are often incredibly difficult to move up from.
More than this, children are equally deserving of a good education since they especially did not choose their situation.
We think if anything, the only way in which children can move away from their upbringing and up and move upwards in terms of economic bracket is if they have an initial good education so that they can access everything in the future.
Because recognize that currently that is the defining factor if I don't get into a good college it is very unlikely that I'm going to be able to access a high paying job.
Second area of clash has to do with benefits of specific education to children.
Too many areas under this m first on how it is better educationally.
We think that when students with specific passions are able to specifically choose schools that are focused on those regions so say that I am very passionate about science or technology I can access a high school that is specific to stem then these students are more likely to be able to grow that passion, learn more about it and build a resume so that they can access a better like college and like access better opportunities in the long term.
We prefer that students are able to be passionate about what they want to be and explore those fields early on rather than waste their time with useless extracurriculars the current public schools overload students with.
We also think that it sends a message to public schools that if they want to continue functioning they have to get better.
So on net we think our side of the house actually gets better public schools in addition to students being able to choose what charter schools they prefer to attend.
We also think there's a social portion to this kind of system.
We think that a very good example of this would be the harvey milk schools that have been established for LGBTQ youth that which provide a safer learning environment by focusing on LGBTQ history and allowing LGBTQ youths to express themselves where otherwise they would not be able to do so.
A key part of education is allowing students to feel safe in their environment because if you do not feel safe, you are unlikely to be able to learn to your full capacity.
Our side of the house creates a world in which if you don't feel comfortable going to school because you are muslim there's a lot of islamophobia, if you are gay and you do not feel comfortable because there's a lot of homophobia, you can choose an environment that will be accepting of you and let you reach your full potential.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"Embryonic stem cell research brings more good than harm, for two big reasons: first, because the good that it brings is quite massive, and far outweighs in importance any possible harms, and secondarily, even if the good is only of marginal importance, the harms, both practical and ethical, I believe are rather minimal, and therefore it's still bringing more good than harm.
So, let's talk about the first one of those things, about why embryonic stem cell research does bring so much good.
There's a few obvious important things that stem cell research does.
I believe there's two big groups of this: first, it as it, can help you come up with more advanced medical technologies, to prevent people from dying, and second of those things is that, it can make maybe existing medicines, or existing technologies cheaper and more accessible to more people.
So, why are these things very important?
So, on the first one of those things, there's a whole lot of things that, even in even in current times, with modern medicine, we don't have cures for.
A lot of things like nerve damage, things like , things to like the central nervous system, brain damage, or if certain organs become compromised, it becomes very difficult to come up with ways in which you can actually replace these organs or cure these kinds of ailments, but stem cell research gives us unique opportunity to combat these problems, by being able to program on certain kinds of, like new cells almost, like unprogrammed cells.
You can direct them into new things, so like, you can almost you can create new kinds of nerve cells, you can create parts of like new organs, things like that.
You can do all kinds of cool things with stem cells that, make it so that you can cure a lot of problems that we currently have, and that's great.
But, the second thing is as far as cheapness and access, because even if a lot of these things exist in the status quo, stem cells give us superior alternatives.
So, for example, if you need to like get a kidney transplant, or something like that, right now you have to wait for like a donor match , and all these things can take a long time, or it cost a lot of money to do so.
If you want to or like a blood donation, things like that.
These things are oftentimes up to chance, or your social status.
But, with stem cells, a lot of these barriers are more likely to come down, because rather than having to wait for a perfect match, or something like that, you can have doctors that are going to be able to create the match for you, by using your by using like your own DNA essentially, and things like that, and then they can redirect the stem cells as replacements and things like that.
So, that can definitely cut down waiting times, and cut down cost, which definitely is going to save people's lives.
So, that's those are the reasons why stem cell does a whole lot of good for people.
Basically, it just saves lives in new and more innovative ways, and at cheaper costs, things that are undeniably good.
But I also think that, there's no real harm from stem cells, on either an ethical or practical level.
So, first on the practical level, there hasn't really been any substantial research that shows that there are any actual real side effects, or problems with stem cells, namely because, the goal is that they're just going to operate like any other cell in your body.
And, while there could be some limited problems associated with, the science actually looks quite optimistic on the efficacy of stem cell like treatments on the problems.
Now, as far as the ethical implications are concerned, there is a big misconception here, and it's that you're just like aborting fetuses, and things like that, specifically for stem cell research.
Oftentimes, these are already aborted fetuses, which is something that people have a right to do, legally you can get an abortion.
So basically, it's just a matter of are these things going to go to waste, or should you have the option to conduct medical research on them.
In a lot of ways, this is the same way as like, allowing people to volunteer as organ donors, or allowing people to volunteer upon death, upon their death, of like donating body parts to science, and things like that.
These are perfectly simple things that we let people do, because they serve a public good, and because they're really not all that infringing on people's rights, or liberties in any capacity.
So, for all of those reasons, very proud to propose this motion."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should further exploit unconventional oil.
What we mean by this is that we would lift current fracking restrictions, we would subsidize the use of unconventional oil governmentally and we would like generally promote the use in the media.
Two main areas of clash: the first about oil independency and and security.
The problem currently is that most western states rely on more middle eastern states to provide their oil because they don't have any oil of their own that is accessible through conventional oil drilling.
This means that countries such as america rely on the opec states or on canada, which means that they aren't truly independent.
Independence is incredibly important for two main reasons: first, let's talk about the social politics.
A perfect example of a situation in which our lack of oil independence has harmed us would be the opec scares of the nineteen seventies, in which arab states pulled oil sales to the US because of political support for israel and the refusal to pull that support.
This led to massive shortages within the united states stall ups at gas stations, people stuck in the roads, people not being able to make it to their jobs.
In the end we have to accept that oil makes up a very large part of our lives insofar as we rely on it to transport us from place to place and heat our homes.
Having to rely on other states stifles us politically because it creates a world in which if we need that oil badly enough, we have to comply with their demands.
We would prefer it if the US and other states were able to act freely in their political motions because we don't like it when oppressive states get to call the shots.
It's a problem if in response to criticisms to human rights abuses arabic states can just say: "" okay, you just can't have oil now. ""
And people have to shut up and deal with it because they don't have any kind of alternative.
The only way in which you get social change is if countries are willing to speak out against each other's against each other's tactics.
And the only way you can speak out against each other's tactics is if you aren't personally harmed in the process.
Secondly though there's also an economic problem here.
It's good when we control our own oil prices because and our own oil supply because with more supply and more access to supply the prices are going to decrease.
This is important because when prices decrease people can drive to more places, they're going to buy more goods in their generally going to be more, there's going to be more investment in a more stable economy.
But also it's important because when you're going to have domestic oil fracking rather than relying on middle eastern oil, you're going to be able to use your own workers.
This creates jobs within the united states which stimulates the economy and allows people to have basic spending power that they didn't have before.
Joblessness is bad both because it forces people on the governmental system that usually cannot handle them, but also because it means that individual people aren't able to contribute to the economy as much.
It's also good because while we can only limit what we tax in imports of oil, given that we need it, you can tax domestic oil a lot more and this revenue is good because it can go into things like social services.
Are second area of clash has to do with efficiency and technology.
In general, we're not going to get rid of oil anytime soon.
It's because green tech is expensive and republican lobbyists like to please their oil constituents.
Because of this, you should then do anything that is more safe and more efficient.
Fracking won't always be bad, because technology improves and it's going to be more likely to improve when you're going to use it more, because there's going to be more of a market incentive to innovate something that is going to be more efficient and more safe, so that less people complain.
We also think that it's at the point that we have a rising population that consumes more and more oil on a daily basis, our only choice without causing people to live a sub par standard of life, is to expand the ways in which we garner our oil while we develop green technology.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that the US should close guantanamo bay.
What we mean by this is that the US would immediately defund, demolish, move the prisoners currently located there to another facility, and thus end the functioning of the prison camp called guantanamo bay, located overseas.
Two main areas of clash: first on how it is contrary to US ideologies and international law.
Let's talk about the geneva convention, and specifically the ways in which it violates it.
So currently the way that the US qualifies guantanamo is that they say that the people there are enemy combatants.
The problem with this is that underneath the geneva convention, which the US agreed to, there is no such delineation.
For the geneva convention all people are who are taken by other countries must have a must have a status as either a prison of prisoner of war and other state's civilian, or a medical professional who has been taken from another state.
And thus there is a convention that is associated with each one.
So convention number one for the way that you treat prisoners of war and so on so forth.
So, when the US delineates a group of people as enemy combatants, they're breaking out of this bubble and they're essentially saying: "" there is no convention and we can treat him them the however the way however the hell we want. ""
But just because the united states government says that something exists, doesn't make it true.
We think that first there's like an ethical issue in terms of following laws that you expect other countries to follow and specifically treating prisoners ethically, but also if the united states is going to get grouchy when others violate laws, it's probably going it probably should be presenting a better example itself, which isn't doing in the status quo.
Moreover, abusive treatment of prisoners is an anti american and anti democratic action.
The fifth amendment protects criminal rights, including protecting them from cruel and unusual punishment.
This applies to anyone whether they're a citizen or not.
This, for instance, is why even if you're taking someone who's an illegal immigrant you still can't beat them up in their jail cell.
You have to deport them, but like while they're here you still treat them like a person.
So, it's unclear why the united states gets to break the rules that apply to any other person just because they aren't directly on the land of the united states.
Like they're still being treated by united states personnel, they're still like property essentially of the united states government.
At the point that that is occurring, we don't think that there is an ethical delineation, or a legal one.
So now let's talk a little bit about these ethics.
Because we think that the reason that we have these laws in the first place is because we've defined systems of morality that say this is the way that we should be treating people.
And as such we think that people do deserve a trial by jury in the ability to contest evidence.
They shouldn't be abused in their jail cells.
Not only, and we think that this is a right that is never extended to those who end up at guantanamo bay.
They don't have a way to say that this evidence is false or argue for their cause, because they're never put forward like a jury of their peers, and the government hasn't answered to anyone about their treatment of them.
This is unethical and devalues a human life.
Our second area of clash has to do with the way that guantanamo bay is ineffective and expensive.
Recognize first that it's been statistically and scientifically proven that torture is not effective and doesn't actually get you any useful information.
We think the bottom line, at the end of the day, is that you could be putting these prisoners into any other prison camp.
It's not the case with the way that obama said, that: "" oh, these are people that are so especially dangerous that any other holding cell is something they can break free of. ""
We think that even if you stopped the abusive tactics of guantanamo and like built a similar facility that was also oversees, the just was a regular jail, they would still be perfectly fine within those facilities.
Like these people don't have superpowers.
We also think that in the end practices like guantanamo alienate our allies who find us unethical.
This actually stifles the united states, especially in terms of finding information outlets, because foreign intelligence is less likely to cooperate when they feel like the united states has been behaving unethically.
Combine this with the fact that it's a massive money pit on our tax dollars, we just think that it's not worth it.
For these reasons abolish guantanamo bay."
"We should abolish the US electoral college.
When the electoral college was instituted it made some degree of sense.
The average person was not able to become informed about the day to day activities of politicians, they weren't able to become fully informed about the issues that politicians acted upon, and it was a good idea to have a proxy to ensure that in cases in which rampant misunderstanding by the public or rampant dissatisfaction with the public's choice would have cost upheaval for our government, that it would have been good to have a proxy, the electoral college made sense.
Nowadays this is not the case.
There's no immense barrier to becoming informed, there's no immense barrier to an informed public, and in fact the proxies that are chosen for this electoral college don't end up serving as that role anyway.
They are no longer at check.
And at the point at which their initial purpose is no longer possible, we think that the electoral college is an anti-democratic institution that undermines the legitimacy of the american state.
So we're going to talk about why it is undemocratic in its nature.
The first thing is that what's obvious and what has arrisen in two of the past five presidential elections is that the electoral college can lead to a case in which the person that receives the majority of votes, the person that wins the popular vote, even with a majority of more than fifty percent, that person can lose in the electoral college, and therefore lose the presidency.
And this means that you end up getting executives who has immense power over american military action, an executives who has an immense amount of control over which legislation can come to pass and which party maintains the amount of power in washington.
These types of things are cued in because of who is the president.
Because it is a sole player in an executive electoral roll.
And you have a situation in which most people did not vote for the person that is in charge.
We think that this is a clearly anti-democratic situation and if you're going to have an executive official, someone that is outside of the legislative body, we think that that person should at least be chosen and a majoritarian way to ensure that that person's most representative of all people in the state.
What it also means, the electoral college, is that you get worse presidential elections despite who ends up in office and you discount the votes of large chunks of people.
The way that this occurs is that if you are a democratic voter in a deeply blue state such as massachusetts or california, or if you're a republican voter in a deeply red state, such as much of the deep south including texas and alabama and mississippi, if you are one of these types of voters your vote simply does not matter, and the reason for this is that in the electoral college in most states you don't need to get, it doesn't matter if you win fifty one percent of the state or if you win seventy six percent of the state.
You get all of those electoral votes and therefore it doesn't make a difference what the margin of victory is.
What this means is that if you are a part of the majority in one of these states you are likely not going to have a meaningful vote because your vote ends up being discounted by the fact that you are , the margin no longer matters.
If you create a system in which there's majoritarian or popular vote, then it doesn't matter if you are one of these voters in these deeply red or deeply blue states, and it no longer makes it the case that swing states get an overwhelming amount of attention because margin starts to matter.
And it starts to matter that you turn out your base, that you attract voters all across the country and that you actually pay attention to those voters.
We think that by abolishing the electoral college you create a system in which the popular vote always wins out.
You create a system in which no matter who becomes the executive, that is a person that was endorsed by most people that were eligible to vote, or most people that turned out to vote, and you create a system in which people actually feel like their vote matters.
It doesn't just matter if you're in a swing state like ohio or florida, your vote can matter in massachusetts, in california and in texas.
And we think that in a democracy everyone should feel that their vote matters.
For these reasons we should abolish the US electoral college."
"We should legalize public nudity.
We're going to take a fairly broad stance on this motion and say that in public spaces, people should be allowed to be nude.
They should be allowed to go out without any clothing on whatsoever and shouldn't have to face any sort of repercussions for these actions.
Now, there's a difference between public indecency and public nudity.
So, for example, peeing on the streets or in somebody's yard, doing something like that, defecating in an area, and obviously being overtly sexual and harassing people while nude, all these things go beyond simple nudity, and we would still punish these things.
But in regards to simply going out in public and being nude, we see no problem with this whatsoever, and we're going to make two broad arguments as to why we should legalize public nudity.
The first is about the philosophy of punishment and why public nudity does not fit in with that standard and cannot be punished on a principle level, and the second's about body acceptance and why we think public nudity and legalizing public nudity would go a long way in creating better body norms.
All right, so first on the philosophy of punishment.
We would say that based on simply the definition of punishment, punishment must be done in response for a crime.
This is the delineation and the distinction that we use to distinguish between punishment and acts of violence and aggression.
It's what we morally use to determine whether or not punishment is just.
Therefore, we'd say that a crime then requires a victim and therefore, punishment, in turn, requires some sort of victim for that crime.
We would say that there's no real victim when it comes to public nudity.
My being out in the public and being nude does not meaningfully inhibit any other person's ability to go on about their day as they see fit.
It may be something that the people aren't entirely comfortable with.
It may people may not want to see me outside in the nude, but this doesn't mean that they're actually victims of some sort of harm that has been done onto them.
For example, an apt comparison would be: I can go out into a public space and with the proper permits or in the proper timing, I can protest and I can say things that I believe to be true that other people may disagree with on a fundamental level and they want me to not say.
But these things do not have a meaningful impact on their ability to live their life and therefore, we do not punish those things.
And this is, again, a distinction between public protest and hate speech.
In the same sense, going about your day and being nude in public isn't something that is actually harmful to those that are around you.
You're just being nude.
You're just out there and taking up the same space and the same capacity that you would be otherwise.
We think that given that this is the case and that there's no victim, you cannot principally justifiably punish someone for public nudity.
Now on to body acceptance.
We think that in the status quo, there's a massive stigma around people's bodies, and there's a massive stigmatization about natural body image, that people believe that in order to put themselves out there and to show their body off in a certain way, you need to be of a certain physical physique, which leads to people having to adopt these horrible standards of beauty and of normality that don't actually match what people do in real life.
Further, we think that there's a shaming that goes on about people being inquisitive about their body and about exploring themselves physically.
We think that this is something that can be mitigated by legalizing public nudity.
By legalizing public nudity, you don't just allow people to take these actions, but you send a signal as a government that there's nothing wrong with someone's physical appearance.
There's nothing wrong inherently with the human form and that being forced to see the human form is not something that is going to harm you in any way.
We think that this signaling mechanism sends a positive message to people within society, especially those that are most vulnerable in society to to bad body norms, such as young people, teenagers and young adults.
We think that by sending this signal out, the state is doing its job in trying to teach good body norms and trying to inculcate people with a type of perspective on the self that makes them feel more empowered, just mentally and physically, and we don't think there's a principled reason to punish these people anyway.
For these reasons, we should legalize public nudity."
"We should ban child actors because for two big reasons.
Reason number one, because it's there's no consent because these children can't possibly know what they're getting into and what the impact is gonna have on them and for number two, because even if it is something that they can consent into ultimately the harms that are likely to come out of this are just too extreme, so the paternalism that you would exert is justified and acceptable.
So first let's talk about consent.
I think that obviously consent is an incredibly important part of decision making in general in a liberal society, but I think that consent and willingness is particularly important when it comes to your job and your work because otherwise you're essentially just a forced laborer.
You're not actually freely engaging in work, and that's like obviously something that's very very egregious.
It's actually slavery, not something that you would accept in some kind of liberal and democratic society.
So let's talk about there why there's no consent in the specific circumstances then with regard to child actors and labor.
So the first reason is because they're just too young.
We are accept that children are incapable of consenting in a lot of ways.
You have things like statutory rape in age of consent for sex, we limit ability for kids to vote, to drive, to drink, do all kinds of decision making process while they're still developing while they're also while they're under the guardianship of their parents who are responsible for them and the like.
And I think this is very important because recognize that also child actors isn't just talking about teenagers or people who we perceive as maybe being more capable but oftentimes, child actors could literally mean infants.
It can mean toddlers.
It could mean people in elementary and middle school.
It's talking about people who are even less developed than you would think of when you typically think of younger people.
So I think that's a big problem.
The next problem is that there could there's no there's possibility of social or parental pressure, and I think that this is very real, and I think this is very likely to be important because there's a lot profit associated with child acting.
If you're a parent you can make a whole lot of money off of this possibly the famousness of your child.
So there's some pressure there but there also could just be more general social pressures that just tell you that this is something that you should do you even if you don't want to and because these are the people these are the adults that you look up to they're your parents.
You're probably likely to listen to them even if it's not what you want and that's not fair to kids.
So we shouldn't allow that to happen.
And the final reason that there's not really able to be any consent is because this is just unenforceable.
It's difficult to enforce legislation that could exist and I think the reason why it's difficult to enforce a law of this legislation is like first and foremost because there's a huge profit motive behind these industries if you're talking about things like the film industry acting and things like.
There's oftentimes a lot of lobbying incentives, a lot of like financial incentives, a lot of motives to maybe do things like legal settlements rather than create boxes things like that.
All kinds of things that make it so more likely than not you're not actually going to see enforcement.
So I don't think that that's very good on that front.
So next I want to talk about just like the degree of impact that this actually has on children because I think that in a lot of ways the stress of working from a young age, the stress of having no timelines, to having to go in front of large audiences constantly, the the pressure of all of these things from your job oftentimes this can result in like a lot of sadness for children.
It can result in a social isolation not growing up with a lot of friendships with people their own age because you're mostly around like professionals in a field or staff and things like that, and I think that this has a real adverse developmental effect on children and I think that this could be the reason why it's more likely that a lot of child actors end up with psychological problems or mental health issues.
There's obviously examples of that.
So for all those reasons I definitely think that we should bad child actors."
"Private universities bring more good than harm.
So what we're going to advocate in this debate is that countries around the world should implement a system similar to the united states where there are both publicly and privately funded universities existing alongside one another.
We have three main arguments for why this is true.
But I think it would be useful to think about this as a comparison between say, berkeley in harvard in terms of public and private universities.
Obviously you can have very good universities of either caliber, at the other end you could have very bad universities of either caliber.
So that's not really what this is about.
But three arguments: first, in terms of research funds.
We don't think it's a coincidence that of the ten universities in the world that produce the most research, eight of them are private american universities, the other two being oxford and cambridge.
When you have a private university it's much easier to raise funds than for a public university.
First of all, you control your own endowment.
You can invest it however you wish.
Some people have jokingly called harvard a hedge fund with a school attached because their thirty five billion dollar endowment is managed by an extremely talented pool of financial advisers and the university makes tons and tons of money every year off of their investments.
Of course when it institution like harvard, yale, wherever, makes all of this money off of their investments, they're able to refund return that to research.
We see that schools like harvard or yale or stanford are able to fund a lot of internal research whereas public schools have to rely on things like the national endowment for the humanities, which may be going away soon because of president trump.
So we see that you get one, more research, and two, research funds that are more resilient to changes in government policy.
This is important because this research does things like discovering new medications, new engineering techniques, new computer programs, etcetera, that going to help real people and make the quality of life everywhere better.
Our second argument is about financial aid.
The other team's going to tell you that private universities are bad because they're expensive.
But what we tell you is that when the schools charge lots and lots of money, they're more able to offer aid to low income students.
Stanford for instance is free if your family makes less than seventy thousand dollars a year.
And then, from that, tuition and the cost of attendance is pro rated, based on your parents income, up until about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year, which is about a doctor's salary in this country.
So we see that universities are able to take the massive amounts of money that they make by billing the children of the elite and use it to subsidize low income people going to those schools.
This is as opposed to public schools which tend to have a low cost for everyone.
But even a relatively low cost of ten thousand dollars for a public university in a state like massachusetts or california, is still inaccessible to the poorest americans who have to go a deep into debt in order to attend school.
Ultimately we think that an elite education is much more in reach at private schools than public schools for the low income people.
Our final argument is about diversity of opinion.
Public schools are required to adhere to certain norms by their governments.
For instance, we see that public universities in the states often require that their staff be a-political, or require that equal numbers of conservatives and liberals are hired, or don't hire religious leaders as faculty.
On the other hand a private school like duke is free to hire priests as faculty.
Cornell, for instance, recently hired a very prominent catholic priest as a latin professor, something that could never happen at a public school.
And in addition they're free to allow their professors to express any political beliefs that they want.
This leads to a competitive marketplace where students can choose to go to a school that reflects their values or were students can choose to go and study with religious leaders and where the best people are more likely to become faculty because they're not excluded based on their political beliefs or their backgrounds.
So for these reasons private uni's print more good than harm.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should introduce universal health care.
Two main areas of clash.
The first, on health care being a right.
Most societies and countries recognize a fundamental right to life for all individuals that applies regardless of your economic standing, race, religion, or other or other arbitrary differences.
We see this when we balk at human rights abuses, because even when it is someone who is incredibly poor, someone who is homosexual, we are still unhappy that they are having these rights violated, because your rights don't come from your immutable characteristics, but rather from some deeper level of personhood that everybody share, it is shared in the way that we suffer in the same ways, in the way that we interact with the world.
But also, I think it's important to establish exactly how arbitrary the lottery of birth is, and why it can never be a factor in deciding where rights lie.
We think at the point the course of an entire life can be changed based on who your parents are, whether you are born into a rich or a poor family, defines whether you can access higher education, defines whether when hard times come, you are able to have a pillow to lean back on.
At the point that such arbitrary differences and like background set aside our entire life like in the long term, we don't think that you can meaningfully affect the way that you distribute rights based on this, insofar as anybody could have had this situation.
Let's talk about health care specifically though.
Because we think that the right to life is only accessible if you also have access to healthcare, which makes healthcare a facilitative right.
If I cannot live a fully self-actualized life, because I don't have my daily dosage of medication because I cannot afford it, we don't think you're actually meaningfully accessing the right to life.
But more than this, we tell you the government already recognizes these kinds of rights, when it does things like redistribute wealth through taxes and supports welfare.
We think this is already a message on the part of the government that says, in order to fulfill the right to life, we must first fulfill some basic needs at the beginning.
We also think that is the government's responsibility to do things like this.
Insofar as the government exists in order to protect the rights that individuals cannot protect themselves, then the right to healthcare and the right to health lays under this.
I myself cannot administer the needed medical attention that I might need in order to survive, and it becomes the job of the government to make sure that I have access to that, because of the rights that I give up in exchange.
More than this, we think that the message that the government sends when they don't provide health care is one that is incredibly pernicious.
Because it says that the amount that we make dictates whether we live or die.
And we think that this necessarily undercuts the equality of every individual, because it evaluates people based on the amount of money that they make and not on the fact that they are human.
Our second area of clash has to do with why it's good for society.
We think that people themselves are individually more productive when they are not sick or struggling with illnesses.
But more on a deeper level than that.
We think that oftentimes preventative care, that people who don't have insurance just don't have access to, is incredibly important in preserving longevity.
If I can't go to the hospital and get regular breast cancer checkups, I will not know that I have breast cancer until it is far too late to do anything about it, and my life is cut short by many years by comparison to other people around me.
We think this is incredibly pernicious, because what this means is that people who don't have access to to healthcare oftentimes end up living much shorter lives that are often much more dangerous, because when you're living with chronic pain or chronic illness, you're also not able to like keep up with your workload, you're going to be taking more sick days, and you're going to oftentimes be much more likely to end up fired or lose your job.
Finally though, I think that a lot of the time the effects this has on youth are also very important.
We think that a lot of the time, youth are expected to drop out of school and take care of sick sick people, and they just wouldn't have this burden if those people had access to insurance.
Basically what this means, is that if my sick mother had insurance when she when she got cancer, I wouldn't have to drop out of school in order to take care of her, and my life would then be much much different, and probably better.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should end the use of economic sanctions.
By this we mean that countries like the US and european union countries should stop cutting off trade and access to international resources to poor more vulnerable countries in order to get them to change policy.
The most egregious example of economic sanctions in recent years was the oil for food program in iraq in the nineteen nineties.
During this period iraq was only able to export oil in exchange for food.
This led to dictator saddam hussein coming up with egregious workarounds that led to half a million people starving due to a lack of food in the country.
The private market was no longer allowed to bring food into the country, it could only come in if saddam hussein was willing to do the right thing.
And surprise surprise, this murderous dictator was not.
As I said, half a million people, most of them under the age of eighteen, starved to death in iraq in the nineteen nineties, whereas previously there had been no food insecurity in the country.
And it is entirely due to economic sanctions led by the united states.
Our first argument, quite simply, is that is unethical because it instrumentalizes the people who live in a country.
The effectiveness of sanctions relies on making the people who live in a country so desperate, that they will rise up and force their government to change its policy.
This might mean starving enough iraqis that they're willing to rise up against saddam hussein, something that didn't happen before the american invasion, or it might mean for instance preventing iranians from importing medicine that they desperately need in order to try to get them to vote for different politicians.
Either way we don't think that starving people or denying them access to medical technology is ever going to be acceptable.
And this is the only way that sanctions work.
Supporters of sanctions try to say that they're targeted at the elite.
But that kind of sanction has never been effective.
Freezing russian oligarchs bank accounts doesn't make them change their government policies, it just makes them double down to try to earn their money back.
And ultimately they know that they can still get their money pretty easily if they just resign from their post.
The only effective type of sanction is the kind that puts people out to the streets for a revolution because they can't corn to feed their children.
And we think this is disgusting.
It treats people as just a means to an end for foreign policy in highly developed countries, who oftentimes have no empathy for the people who are suffering.
The western news media is extremely complicit in this by refusing to show the effects on real people that economic sanctions have.
This is evil.
It's just as evil as when the british would starve people in india during the colonial period.
And it's fundamentally no different.
But aside from the extremely severe moral concerns I have about this, we also think that the use of sanctions is fundamentally arbitrary and that this leads to countries having more extreme behavior.
Right now for instance we see that sanctions are aren't actually applied to the worst human rights abusers, they're just applied to the countries that western countries want to have more power over.
They are very literally a tool for imperialism.
Right now venezuela is not one of the world's worst human rights abusers, despite what american news will tell you.
Venezuela doesn't have death squads or concentration camps.
It's just a slightly less democratic country than most western forms.
Meanwhile, venezuela is being sanctioned while western countries are pouring money on assad, who used chemical weapons on his own people, because he listens to them and supports them whereas the venezuelan government has refused to kowtow to the american government.
Similarly, countries with large manufacturing bases like china are able to do whatever they want while a more isolated country like venezuela can be bullied by the international community.
Sanctions are not applied to the worst offenders, they're not applied to countries that act especially badly.
Oftentimes they're applied to countries like iran that just want to defend themselves from aggressive neighbors, and they're being punished arbitrarily by western powers because they refuse to be part of this new imperialist system.
We don't think western countries have any right to dictate policy in other countries and therefore that sanctions are inherently unjust.
For these reasons, and many others I don't have the time to say right now, we must end the use of sanctions.
Thank you."
"We should ban trans fat usage in food.
So we think that the way that this would be implemented is that the government would institute this ban on the systemic level.
So if any food producer produced food with trans fats, it wouldn't be allowed to be sold on open markets.
Obviously there'd be penalties and fines and things like that for these types of violations.
We don't think the model is too necessary.
So, firstly we're going to talk about why the government can paternalize in this instance, and broadly when it's justified for the government to paternalize, and secondly, why trans fats are so problematic and under this paradigm need to be banned.
So, we think that individuals are horrible it doing a couple of things: firstly there tremendously bad at on their own gathering information.
They do a very bad job of researching the things that interact with them on a day to day basis, generally because these things are often protected for by the government if they're so dangerous, and when they're not, we generally have an acceptance that there's some sort of bare minimum safety standards in the things that we consume.
Secondly, individuals are horrible at planning for the long run.
Individuals are incredibly short sighted in how they choose to seek pleasure.
This isn't just the fact that individuals may psychologically not be able to think about the future, but also the fact that our mental and biological impulses drive us for instant an immediate self gratification.
We think that this means that when it comes to things that are unhealthy for us, we often choose to do those things even though there are clear health benefits to not doing those things.
For example, smoking is something that people are physically driven to do even though in the vast majority of cases people that smoke are aware of the fact that doing so will have disastrous health implications for them moving on.
Given that individuals are bad at these two instances, and the government exists in order to protect individuals rights, they exist in order to maximize individual utility, in instances when people are not able to make informed decisions and are not able to internalize the harms, especially when there's very little loss of liberty in regulating these types of things, which we think is the case and allowing people not allowing people be trans fats, we think that in these instances we we, when clear damage arises from these things the government can intervene.
So, what is that clear damage that trans fats do that allow them to intervene in this instance?
So firstly, they're addictive.
It's it's, trans fats are put in food and there's a biological drive to consume those things in a similar way that there's a biological drive for a cigarette smoker to consume tobacco and to consume nicotine.
These types of drives are often something that individuals are simply unaware of when they're choosing you consume the food, which means they can't make an informed decision to consent into the implications of that.
And even if they could, it's difficult for people to be able to break away from those things and we don't think that we should allow things that are openly addictive to be so clearly and plainly used.
Secondly, there is absolutely no health value in trans fats.
People don't internalize the long term harms and they need the protection.
Trans fats have immense damage to the individual body.
They aren't very easily used for energy, they aren't these things that provide any sorts of nutrients or or health benefits to the body.
In fact they're only detrimental.
They only assume they only they only harm the individual's health in the long run.
And this is important for society as well.
Recognize that these costs are passed down through things like healthcare and economic loss, when people are not be able to provide, they're not able to participate in the economy, because of the health the health damages that they take on from consuming these things.
There are immense social harms for allowing a society that becomes more and more obese, like our society is, and we think that we need to check on these types of problems in the status quo to ensure that we aren't harmed in the long run, and that the government is obligated to paternalize in these in this instance to help its citizens.
For these reasons we should ban trans fats usage in food."
"We should abolish the right to silence.
So what we're arguing on our side of the house is that we should be able to require people to provide information when we're conducting a criminal or civil investigation.
This would lead to a few changes from the status quo.
First of all, people wouldn't have the right to refuse to answer questions by remaining silent.
We would be able to help them to answer or punish them if they fail to do so.
And secondly, people would be able to incriminate themselves.
We would be able to ask people questions that would lead to their own incrimination and they would not be able to refuse on legal grounds, as they can right now in many jurisdictions.
In the US, this would lead to large changes to the fifth amendment and, presumably, comparable legal changes in other parts of the world as well.
Before we get into our two arguments, I'd just like to point out that the purpose of an investigation, be it criminal or civil, is fact-finding.
Ultimately, if a court is successful or not is determined by whether it has access to information or jurors or judges to make good decisions.
And what we do by removing this right to silence is increase the amount of information available to judges and jurors.
After all, oftentimes, nobody knows better than the accused what really happened in a given situation.
So we need to have access to their information.
Our first argument is that we're okay with requiring truth even if it's self-incriminating.
We think that, ultimately, because the purpose of a trial or an investigation is to determine what happened in a given instance, that it should be a higher-order concern to find out what that truth is than to let people protect themselves.
It seems absurd that we don't do more to require people to tell us what they're actually responsible for just because it might hurt that person.
A court has no special obligation to the accused as opposed to anyone else except for providing them with access to the outcome of their actions.
In other words, courts need to protect innocent people not guilty ones.
Therefore, we shouldn't take special considerations to prevent people from being asked to incriminate themselves since, if they're guilty, the court ought punish them, and if they aren't, then the court won't.
This seems fairly straightforward.
This idea that people shouldn't have to incriminate themselves underlies the idea of this right to silence.
Even if this was perhaps culturally relevant at some point in the past, because it likely leads to some guilty people going free, and perhaps even worse, to some innocent people going to jail, it should probably be abolished because it has these second-order harms.
And our second argument is that there are more important concerns than just this ability to require a right to silence.
I've already mentioned how this could lead to the wrong people being convicted or the right people not being convicted but I think that aside from that, there are some cases where the public just has a right to this information.
Consider a case, for instance, in which a major oil company had dumped millions of gallons of oil into the gulf of mexico, and the american people needed to know if the oil company had been negligent or if this had just been an act of god.
If people can't be forced to testify, if they're allowed to remain silent and we're not allowed to judge them based on that silence, then it's very difficult to determine what actually happened in the situation.
And that means that people living in the affected area might not get recompense for the damages that they've suffered.
This can really harm thousands or even millions of people potentially.
Similarly, some cases have bearing on national security.
If we were trying, for instance, someone who had leaked military secrets to a foreign power, we would need to know exactly what had been leaked, and millions of people might be at risk if that information weren't available.
But, right now, we wouldn't be able to compel that person to speak because of their right to silence.
We think that even if this right is sometimes useful, ultimately when there are great tradeoffs, it should be abrogated, and therefore it should be a privilege and not a right.
For all these reasons, we should abolish the right to silence.
Thank you."
"We should protect internet privacy.
Two main arguments, first on preventing doxing.
Lots of people get really angry at each other on the internet and it's not just about your basic like interactions, like maybe you'd have in person when you're really mad at someone who's driving slowly in front of you.
These are actually individuals who are able to collect themselves in concentrations of people like them.
So if they happen to be aggressive or emotionally unstable they're likely to be interacting with individuals who are also like that, or individuals who aren't like that but they're already in environment where they feel comfortable being like that or like they don't know who they're interacting with, so even if I'm like a ten year old on the internet I don't know if I'm talking to a really angry sociopathic thirty year old man or another ten year old like me.
So the problem is the internet is one of the few places in which you have contact with complete strangers who are capable of being incredibly unpredictable and incredibly unstable in a way that doesn't happen the same way in reality.
And if privacy is not protected it's really easy to trace someone's internet presence and make it into their like reality location and reality entity.
And we think this is really dangerous because what can be just a regular internet fight for you can be something that deeply offends someone else and they now decide to do things like track you down, like hurt you or harass your or harm your family.
And we think this can get really really predatory.
Like we already see this with women in gaming communities.
We see that it is actually an incredibly unsafe space for them because men in that area see it as an area that is male dominated, they objectify woman fairly aggressively, and you see first of all that this results in less women being in that space in the first place but also that these kind of communities aggregate these people who tend to be more aggressive, who tend to be more sexist.
So we think what would happen on their side of the house if you don't protect internet privacy is that it's a lot easier for one of those men to get a hold of that woman's information and show up at her house and do her harm.
We think this also ends up with like young children.
We think a lot of the time there are individuals on the internet who are involved with crime and we think that sometimes there's like a lot of sex trafficking happens over the internet.
So if you're interacting with a child who doesn't realize how to protect themselves that's something that can be really dangerous for them.
So protecting internet privacy isn't just about like accountability or about a person being able to post hate speech.
It's about protecting people from the individuals who do that.
Because those are the people who are more likely to take action against someone who is innocent.
It is unlikely that innocents are going to take action against someone who is doing bad things.
And so we also just think their safety is always going to be more important by virtue of the fact that they are innocent.
Like sure, we'll let some bad guys get away with being bad as long we protect individuals who really need protecting.
But our second argument is about promoting individual freedom.
Because recognize that the internet has become to mean way more than just a mode of communication or a mode of distracting myself when I'm bored.
It's become a viable path by which individuals self actualize and discover parts of their identity.
And we think oftentimes this is done through things that people would find incredibly embarrassing if individuals were to confront them about it in reality.
Like the kind of pornography that I watch or the videos that I watch or the video games that I play, these are all things that I might find to be shameful or embarrassing just because of societal stigma, but in reality these are ways in which we discover more things about myself.
So we think it would be really problematic because a perceived change in privacy is what makes people feel uncomfortable with accessing the previous forums that brought them joy.
So we think that when internet privacy decreases those people stop feeling comfortable being themselves.
It's also just about the individuals who aren't permitted to do things around their surroundings, so if you don't buy that an individual has the right to be comfortable on the internet and be safe and secure in their private doings we do think you probably ought buy that a child born to homophobic parents in a homophobic area ought be able to access the forms that allow them to discover more about themselves.
Proud to propose."
"The right to asylum is not absolute.
To be clear, the right to if the right to asylum were absolute, what this means is that there is no instance in which one can be denied asylum, which means that if someone is being persecuted within their country for any variety of reasons, if someone is not able to live safely within their home and would qualify as a refugee or an asylum seeker, that that person needs to be accepted by any state that they tried to go to, because the right of asylum is absolute, and therefore the state can't make subjective choices about whether or not they're going to admit individuals.
Okay.
So, two we have number of reasons as to why this just isn't feasible.
We think that an absolute right is problematic for states to function on, because states essentially need to be utilitarian.
States have obligations to their citizens that come prior to any other obligations they hold.
Because the state is essentially a coercive force that controls house individuals within its borders can function, and because individuals by and large are born in those states, become citizens in those states without their consent, and are forced to live under those types of laws, their rights and their protections need to come prior in order for the state to be just, rather than to be coercive.
So, given that the state exists to serve its citizens, we think that it's clear that refugees and asylum seekers may have equal rights, like probably they may have equal moral claims to these types of things, but the state as an arbiter of those rights needs to give preference to one over the other.
We think that if you give these that to have an absolute right to asylum would be to grant all individuals, both those that are your citizens and potential asylum seekers, the exact same rights, or the exact same rights and protections.
So, there are a few reasons why this just might be a problem.
In instances in which you may need to restrict the the ability for people to enter.
Firstly, if you're an asylum seeker from an area in which a plague has just broken out and which you may be carrying, viruses that could contaminate the population in which if it was a disease that could be spread throughout society rather quickly, we think this is an instance in which it's clear that the society and the state needs to give preference to its citizens, it needs to restrain the ability for that person to enter the country, even though they may be under duress, even they may be under attack by their own society, by their own civilization.
Given that it would be a harm to the state if this person were to come in, we think that the overriding rights of the majority within the state would outweigh.
Secondly, if people are seeking asylum en masse, because there were a large conflict going on in the region, say there is a massive amount of refugees seeking asylum, we think it could be simply a too great of an economic cost.
Given that the economy and how the economy is functioning is crucial to the well-being of citizens within a state, and that the state has a fungible amount of resources that it can drain on doing things like providing social welfare, providing food, providing for the basic necessities of the citizens, if refugees and asylum seekers are coming into the country en masse, and we've seen this in europe, we've seen this in states, especially in the middle east, in which refugee camps are existing en masse right now, what this means is that there's a massive drain on resources that the state has.
When this occurs, it means that the quality of life of those within the state can can decline dramatically because of the strain on resources, even those that exist within the states, within the within the home state who have who need to access social goods through the state, who are impoverished otherwise, discriminated against in the marketplace that need these types of resources for survival, can be stripped of them when you allow for an absolute right to asylum.
We think it's clear that there are certain restrictions that in certain instances mean that the state needs to weigh the rights of those within its borders over those outside of its borders.
Otherwise the state is simply a coercive body that arbitrarily controls the lives of those within its borders, but doesn't control the lives of those outside of its borders.
In order to justify that type of coercive capability, the state needs to give preference to its citizens, and sometimes asylum seekers go contradictory to that.
We don't think that the vast majority of instances people should be declined the right to asylum, but we certainly think that the right of asylum is not absolute."
"We should end solitary confinement.
First, I think the clarifying model here is that we don't think that solitary confinement should be used as a punishment anymore.
We think that if a prisoner was to ask to be solitary confined or completely isolated because they're afraid for their own safety or something similar, that is like a consensual thing that we can honor, right?
Like we can agree to do what that person wants but there should never be a situation in which the jail or the government says: we're going to take this person against their will, put them in this dark box with like nothing in the room and no interaction of people for however much time we designate.
That is the solitary confinement we want to be stopping.
Two main arguments, first on cruel and unusual punishment.
The united states constitution protects people against cruel and unusual punishment because we realize that some fundamental human rights should remain, even when the person has done wrong, that even someone who was done terrible things should not be treated too badly because it makes us just as bad as whatever crime that person committed, because we can recognize humanity even when the person who committed the crime didn't recognize humanity.
Solitary confinement is the definition of cruel and unusual punishment.
It doesn't serve a real purpose.
It's literally just meant to crush someone's psyche into submission and intimidate them and make them scared of it happening again.
Numerous studies have been done on this, and it's been shown that it is absurdly bad for the people who go through it.
There are other ways to punish someone that don't involve psychological torture, like taking away some privilege that other people might receive, like not letting them go outside for a couple of days, or making them clean up at like the cafeteria afterwards, like any number of things you can come up with that can punish someone without psychologically torturing them and scarring them for the rest of their life.
Doing solitary confinement is the choice on the part of the prison system to be the most cruel regardless of the fact that they don't have to be, and the governments need to protect prisoners from this.
This is especially true since, in general, prisoners are a vulnerable class.
Regardless of the fact that they committed a crime at some point, these are people who, once they are in jail, are completely dependent on the state and have no way of controlling their own lives, or desires, or preferences.
So we need to have those extra protections, because it's really easy to take advantage of someone who has no resources, who is locked in the same space.
This is why we do things like put limits on the kinds of experiments medically that can be done on prisoners, because we recognize that their ability to consent out of those are significantly limited as compared to the average person, and we need to protect them from that.
Our second argument is about why solitary confinement is impractical.
First, it just literally doesn't work, right?
You have more recidivism because solitary confinement really messes people up.
They just end up resenting the system more and are more likely to act out against it.
Solitary confinement doesn't help rehabilitate anyone.
It doesn't serve any function since prison already isolates someone from society.
And you can also recognize that you can also isolate someone from the rest of the prison population without putting them into solitary confinement, right?
Like you can put them into a separate jail cell, or you can make them sit in like a specific area that keeps them around people but doesn't put them in solitary confinement and doesn't put them in the conditions that specifically make solitary confinement so traumatizing.
So like insofar as it doesn't accomplish what the prison wants it accomplish, we just don't think it should exist on that basis alone, but also it's really expensive.
Like, it requires separate quarters and separate guards.
It takes up space where you could have housed multiple inmates in that same area, and we think that that kind of thing is just not something we need in the prison at the point that it's like an active problem that prisoners aren't getting proper food or proper other kinds of care, and the money could just go there instead, which we think is always better.
Proud to propose."
"We should ban abortions.
When we're talking about abortions in this debate we're going to keep out two exceptions in which we would not ban abortions but we think this is for principled reasons.
Firstly in instances of rape.
We don't think that a woman should be forced to carry the product of a crime that has been committed against her and in those instances we would allow for abortion.
And secondly, in the instance of a risk to the mother's life, in that instance we again think it is not fair to force a woman to use her own body to bring about the end of her own life and in those instances we think an unreasonable expectation is placed on the woman that would force her to carry a child to term.
But aside from those two instances we think that we should ban abortion.
So why should we care about the fetus itself and why should we think of this thing as a life?
Well, we think that the best way in which we can conceptual rights, conceptualize rights is a framework in which all human beings are included, but we think you need a principal justifications for this and the best principle justification for this is one that relies solely on the biological fact that you are a human being, that is in your DNA that you are a human.
The reason for this, as opposed to other systems, is because other systems are suspect to abuse.
This is because if you rely on someone's inclusion in the political community, then vast amounts of people can be excluded and harmed in a variety of ways, through either political or non political means.
If you use it through the ability of someone to express their preferences or the ability of someone to express human traits, then we think that you exclude large numbers of any community as well such as infants or children or coma patients who aren't fully able to express their part in the political or social community, and in those instances we think that you can get a large amount of rights violations that occur.
So we think that the best in any number of ways.
So we think that the best way to conceptualize rights is one in which all human beings are given full creed and space solely on the fact that they are a human.
Given that this is the case, we don't think that you should exclude fetuses from the definition of what it is to be human.
The reason for this is that we think we value potentiality all the time and just because someone just because that potential is in the form of the fetus we shouldn't stop following it now.
What we mean by this is when we passed laws and we set up a society, we set one up in a sense that we try to plan and protect the future of our society in the future, progeny of that society, we try to set up institutions that will last beyond our own years, we try in many instances to fight things like global warming which pose existential threats to our race and our species, and in those instances we clearly show that we value the potentiality of those people.
So we don't think that we should otherwise void that potentiality once it becomes more potential in the form of a physical embodiment that could otherwise become life if not impeded.
So why do we think further that we should give preference to the life of the fetus over the mother's autonomy and decision to make a choice?
Because we think that the fetus in this instance has no ability to advocate for itself.
It is no it has made no decision that brought it into the place in which it could be aborted or could be alive and because it is not able to fully advocate for itself, we think that we should, because we overwhelmingly value life in the status quo as a measurement of good and utility we think that we should then defer to that in this instance as well in which, because the disutility to the mother of having to carry a child may be incredibly high, we think that we should do of wide variety of things like provide better access to contraceptives and better birth control methods and try to get better education to prevent further unwanted pregnancies, but once someone has made the free choice with the knowing risk that sexual intercourse could occur with a pregnancy and that could be something that happens, we think that given that to violate that child's, to abort that pregnancy is to violate the potentiality of that child, and put out life that otherwise we would have valued, if not for that instance.
We think that because of our duty to protect our progeny, that we have fully expressed in how we construct society and because that progeny has no ability to advocate for for itself in our legal systems in our society, we should ban abortions to ensure that they are protected."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish the american job act.
Two many areas of clash, the first on the massive increase of spending, and the impacts we think it has.
Recognize, that this jobs act incorporated the expenditure of more than thirty five billion dollars, in efforts to increase either the way that we find jobs, unemployment benefits, and numerous other things, but this money doesn't grow on trees.
It comes from somewhere.
These stipulations included increases in taxes.
The problem with this is that it angers the average citizen, and causes them not to vote for good money spending ventures later.
Once we show you that there are more harms to the american jobs act, and the way that it increases jobs, we think it's also easy to recognize that, if you're not spending money in the most efficient manner, you shouldn't waste that money and that political will.
There are real issues in this world, that are more important than short term unemployment, that this act cannot solve.
We think that issues of homelessness, issues of issues of reproductive rights, all of these things are all more important, than trying to stipulate jobs and unemployment currently.
More than this, we think it makes their lives harder.
A lot of people simply cannot afford to have more taxes than they currently pay, and it actively interferes with their way of life.
Why does it matter, if you increase the jobs of some, if you also make it incredibly difficult for others to live, regardless of the existence of a job?
The reasons that I work is in order to put make enough money to support myself, but if that money does not help me to support myself, why would I why would why do I care if I have that job in the first place?
More than this though, we think that the other impact of this money is that it cuts other social services, which is actively harmful to lives.
We don't know whether this jobs act will work, moreover we have significant reasons to see that it is not, but we know that people need things like welfare, and medicare, and the ability to access free clinics, and we know that this act will cut those.
Why would we cut something that we know is functional, in order to pursue a dream?
The answer is that we shouldn't.
We think that it makes moreover though, we think that it makes people resent the jobs act, and those who are benefited by it.
IE those who are for long term unemployed, those receiving unemployment benefits, all of these people, who are already often hated by society and stigmatized, get even more hate on their side of the house.
Things like increased attacks, decreases in helpful legislature, all of this is likely to occur when you pass the american jobs act.
Our second main area of class has to do with why it's not a good solution.
We think the way that this act operates is by creating a dependency of the market on government intervention, and a government like preparedness to create more jobs, by injecting money into like the way that we make jobs.
What this means is that these are short term jobs, that go away after the government stops injecting the same amount of money, which they just can't afford to do on a yearly basis, or after sometime.
This means that in the long term what you get is a worse recession, that that destroys more jobs in the long term, and creates more distrust in the government, when prices go up, and our resources plummet.
We think what happens on their side of the house is that, in the long term, you don't get you don't get solid bipartisan support for a good solution, because you've already wasted all of your efforts on this one.
Abolishing the american jobs act now prevents this long term recession, because it forces us to deal with our problems with unemployment, and finding a way to do so now, and not to so in an artificial manner.
So, maybe investing in new tech centers, investing in things that will actually create stable jobs, rather than pouring money into trying to extend the jobs that already exist, will be a long term solution.
More than this, we think that the jobs act extends unemployment benefits, which could actually increase unemployment in and of itself, because if I'm going to make more money by being unemployed, then I will by working a minimum wage job for forty hours a week, why would I work that minimum wage job?
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should abolish standardized testing, because people learn in different ways.
It is a waste of time and it is a waste of money.
So, first, why do we think that standardized testing is a problem for different kinds of learners.
Obviously there are good testers and there are bad testers.
The problem with this, is that good testers are oftentimes not actually learning really anything from the process of taking these tests themselves, and the test doesn't even provide a whole lot of value to them.
Just because you're able to memorize a whole bunch of facts, you are able to figure things out on a test, doesn't mean that there's actually any real indication or proof that you've learned anything, or that you're actually prepared to engage with the real world.
However, on the flip side of this there's also obviously bad test takers, and just because somebody isn't necessarily good at taking a test, doesn't mean that they haven't learned skills that can be applied in some way, and it doesn't mean that they're prepared to move on to the next ring, or other things like that, and it certainly doesn't mean that these people have any less degree of intelligence than people that are good test takers.
But additionally, we also think that standardized testing is a waste of time.
Because recognize that when you have a standardized test, it doesn't allow for the specialization that comes with individual classes that people are taking.
So for example, when I was growing up in florida, I was required to take the florida comprehensive assessment test or the FCATs.
And I would have to learn about and I would my teachers would be forced to spend weeks teaching to this test, and this would happen regardless of what level of the class you're taking, so if you're taking more advanced classes you could be having to waste weeks on end making sure to reviewing this basic material, so that way these tests are still going to be passable for students.
And on the flip side, if students are maybe not prepared necessarily to be taking these tests and should be taking other classes for that, this is necessarily a good uses of time as well.
But in addition to it not being applicable to skill level, we don't necessarily think that it's controlled very well for content areas either, because oftentimes the concepts that are covered on these tests are rather basic concepts, rather broad concepts, concepts that can't necessarily be applied to a whole lot of things, and things that are ultimately not all that important to actually learn about or know about anyway.
But the final thing that I want to talk about is about how this is a waste of time.
And the reason I think sorry, that this is a waste of money.
And I think that it's very important to talk about money and its relation to this, because keep in mind that there's an opportunity cost with education spending, and that every dollar that is spent administering standardized test is money that could actually be spent on making schools better, it's it's money that could be spent on better textbooks, on paying teachers more.
And this is especially important given that oftentimes education budgets are among the first things that get slashed by governments in times of recessions or hardships.
So why do we think that standardized tests are a waste of money.
Because I think that the costs that come with them are oftentimes quite high.
For example, you need to make sure that you pay for all of the booklets and all the scantrons that get used.
Oftentimes these things are costly in and of itself since you need millions of them.
You also need machines to read the tests, and you need also proctors or graders to administer the test and look over tests and grade tests, you have to pay for the hours of those people.
You have to administer trainings for people so they are prepared to teach how to teach to the test.
And you also have to provide money to question researchers, question triers, things like that as well.
All of those costs can eventually stack up and pile up, and they could be all of that money, each dollar of that money could be used anywhere else.
And it is for all of those reasons that we are incredibly that I'm incredibly proud to propose that we abolish standardized testing."
"I'm proud to propose the motion that we should ban bitcoin.
We're willing to interpret this is just cryptocurrency in general, because it would probably be pretty dumb to have a system where only one form of cryptocurrency is illegal.
So for all intents and purposes we'll be defending generally the idea that we should ban any form of cryptocurrency.
Our first independent point is that cryptocurrency is inherently volatile.
This is because it's not backed by any sort of central government that is specifically issuing some sort of like guarantee against the currency.
I think there's two ways you can interpret this: one is sort of like the older model, like the sort of gold standard model, of just assuming that you have like have to have like a physical object to back up the like actual like worth of the currency.
This is probably less true now, but I guess a gold standard would be technically more stable.
But I think what's more important here is that cryptocurrency isn't backed up by any sort of institution that is willing to actually say like: "" this is worth something "".
It is essentially a stock.
Like it's based on the idea that other people want the cryptocurrency, which means that things like consumer confidence and what not can make its value fluctuate very wildly.
We think this hasn't been an issue as of yet largely because cryptocurrencies haven't been used for a ton of stuff, particularly in the legal market, but we think in the long term if this is allowed to develop into a more commonly used form of currency, that volatility will probably have strong effects on the economy.
Our second independent point is the illicit use of cryptocurrency.
So right now the primary way in which this is used is to purchase things that normally would be illegal to purchase.
Because it is a cryptocurrency, that isn't like based on a physical object, and thus the possession of it can't be traced back to an individual person, it's used to pay for things like say drugs or like illegal forms of pornography or like any number of other like illegal things.
So we think that while there's probably some questionability about whether or not you should care about like drug purchases, like if someone's just like buying pot online, we think there is probably a broad range of things, from pot up to like assault weapons and other types of heavy arms they can be purchased using this type of currency.
So at the extreme end of the spectrum then there are definite like clear cut harms of it be easier to obtain things that should not be easy to obtain.
But beyond this, we think that there's just more of a principled harm in that it undermines the legitimacy of the government and its capacity to institute the rule of law.
We think that as a general rule of thumb, that when the government's ability to regulate things is undermined by new technology, the solution should never be like: "" oh well I guess we should just give up on regulating it "".
Like, it is certainly reasonable to question whether or not a specific object should be illegal, but generally I think it makes more sense to say: "" we should retain our control on the rule of law "", and instead then just like independently reconsider our laws.
Our third and final independent point is that we believe that this form of currency becomes increasingly problematic with the rise of artificial intelligence.
We think this is articulated in two ways: the first is that bitcoin mining, like the process by which you get bitcoins can be easily automated.
So this creates problematic like economic consequences in terms of how quickly this currency can be harvested by individuals with access to greater artificial intelligence technology.
So like large firms that develop this technology quickly, like I don't know maybe amazon or something or like whatever, will be able to mine cryptocurrency quickly and we think that this will lead to widening income inequity across the world.
Insofar as just like this greater technology will translate in a very direct sense into material wealth.
But secondly we think it's problematic insofar as it poses a significant risk of a-I competition with human beings.
That is to say that any foreseeable like future where there is some level of competition between humans and and highly sophisticated artificial intelligence can be greatly greatly worsened by the ability of artificial intelligence to circumvent government institutions and instead use non governmental forms of currency.
Given the high likelihood a problematic consequences with sort of artificial intelligence revolution, we think this is a contingency worth avoiding.
Proud to propose."
"We should abolish the presidential pardon.
The presidential pardon is unethical for three main reasons: first is about justice.
We think that victims rights are violated by presidential pardons in four main ways.
First, victims never find out what happened when a pardon takes place before a trial occurs.
This is problematic because victims have a right to know what happened to them and their family.
We allow for the actual airing of truth to occur in the criminal justice system when we get rid of the presidential pardons, which we think is an essential part of our system of law.
Truth must be pursued, law must be pursued, and understanding is good for all parties.
Secondly, though, we think that victims can never confront the person who harmed them.
This is incredibly problematic as it reduces the ability to have catharsis and to reduce pain in meaningful ways.
Person never even stands trial, which reduces the ability to actually fulfill the victims' rights.
The second reason that victims' rights are violated is because victims have a right to retribution.
If we look at morality and ask why enough times, we eventually get to some base intuitions.
This is the base of where morality is from.
We think there are some base intuition of retribution that we all, in some sense, share, that we want we want this to occur through the criminal justice system.
We believe that the state has an obligation to enforce this enforce this retribution for two reasons: first, enforcing justice and retribution is the basis of the criminal justice system, and second, the justice system is formed to fulfill the will of the people who desire this retribution to happen.
The third reason the victims' rights are violated is that it violates the right to recourse.
We think the victims can never receive things like monetary compensation through presidential pardons, which is bad for two reasons.
First, they deserve this resource because owed to them and second, they might need this compensation because they were harmed, whether it was money that was stolen or something that was taken away from them.
The fourth reasons victims' rights are violated is because they cannot actually determine if the individual they're accusing is the one who did this harm against them.
We think that presidential pardons essentially remove any possibility for the court to figure out if this person is not guilty and if they need to keep searching for the person who committed the crime.
This means that the actual person who committed the crime could go free.
My second argument is that it violates the principles of our system of justice.
We think it's inconsistent with the ideal of equal protection because it provides a system of protection for individuals based on what the president feels.
It is unjust for them to pick and choose as they see fit.
It is particularly unjust as well because we think that people with political ties are far more likely to get pardons.
If you look at sheriff arpaio or if you look at the pardoning of nixon, each of these had a political end to their pardon.
At best, it's only people with political ties who can actually contact the president and get this benefit.
We also think it violates a system of checks and balances because they're essential features in a stable society, but there's no real check on presidential power in terms of the criminal justice system.
They can straight out ignore the justice and the judicial branch however they see fit, due to presidential pardons.
My third argument is it largely leads to worse outcomes.
We think that it creates distrust in the political system as people feel betrayed by whatever politician actually betrays the trust of the people and lets a criminal go.
We also think it causes harms to society as it minimizes political deterrence, which we think is essential to prevent things like corruption in politics or otherwise faking votes.
It further reduces faith in the justice system as well, as people feel like they've been robbed of the justice that is due to them.
This means people are less likely to participate in the justice system.
Finally, we think it means the guilty are far more likely to go free.
We don't think that presidents are actually good at making decisions based on the societal good.
They mostly make it for political reasons and as such, this means that more guilty people will go free and continue to commit crimes.
For this reason, we should abolish the presidential pardon."
"Reality television does more harm than good.
So just to be clear what we're talking about, we're looking at programs like american idol, survivor, the bachelor, things like that where they'd record people supposedly in real or genuine situations and then edit what they record and put it on TV for everyone to watch and by do more harm than good, I think that what we're defending on our side is that the world would be a better place if there were no reality television.
So with that in mind, two main arguments for you.
The first is that reality television promotes unrealistic and harmful expectations in its viewers.
Recognize that reality television does something that other forms of entertainment don't, which is that it claims to reflect the real world as it is.
We think that when people watch, say, drama on television, they don't expect it to accurately reflect the way that people live and they don't allow it to inform their own expectations for their lives in the same way that they would for reality television.
Why must this be true?
When people watch reality TV shows, something like I don't know, keeping up with the kardashians, they watch this and even though it's heavily edited and doesn't reflect the lives that the characters live, they watch this with the expectation that it does because that's the fiction that the producers of the show create.
What this means is that people think that their lives should be similar to the ones on television, that they should follow a narrative in a script, that they should be able to conspicuously consume in the same way as the people on the show.
Now it's true that conspicuous consumption obviously is much older than reality television.
That people have been envious of the wealthy and powerful much longer than reality television has been around, but I do think that it intensifies these experiences when people see a super heightened fictional reflection of what it's like to be in a particular circumstance and then feel inadequate about their own lives, when they compare them to this reality television.
I think that the particular thing that we regret so much about reality television is the claim that it reflects the real world.
If you produce the same shows with the acknowledgment that they are heavily edited works of fiction, then we think that you wouldn't see these harms to the same degree because people particularly those who are young and impressionable or less educated wouldn't be under the impression that this reflects the real world.
With that in mind I think it's clear that the harms to those populations clearly outweigh any benefits in terms of entertainment value that these reality shows may have.
Our second argument is that reality television is harmful because it crowds out other media.
The reason why it seems like any TV channel you turn on nowadays is showing reality television is that this is the cheapest form of TV to produce.
Something like a drama like law and order cost a certain amount in terms of writing and you have to travel around for sets, there's lots of union people you have to employ, it's very expensive to produce something like that even if it is ultimately successful but a reality TV show can draw the same number of viewers and you don't need the same amount of expensive writers or the same amount of help.
You can choose to film it in a given location.
Many reality TV shows have as this form of gimmick that they're filmed on an island or something, presumably somewhere where you don't have to hire a lot of union people the way you would if you filmed in los angeles.
So we see that you see a reduction in other types of television entertainment as a result of the increased popularity of reality TV.
We think that this limits the access to producing television for many communities, that you're more likely to see the crowding out of dramas with african american stars or dramas that appeal to a particular other minority group because there are likely to be fewer instances of these genres being produced in the first place given that reality TV is crowding them out.
We think that the losers are always going to be those at the fringes.
So for these reasons we think that reality TV does more harm than good.
Thank you."
"We should end the use of economic sanctions.
Make no mistake economic sanctions are a tool of war.
They threaten the industry's of states.
They put individuals into starvation, ultimately cause mass loss of life and loss of welfare as well.
They are used to a disgusting degree and far too cavalierly by a variety of states which deem themselves just, as they steal food from the mouths of poor individuals.
The continued usage is an abomination and a true affront to justice and as such, we would support the following model: that economic sanctions be outright banned, that organizations such as the UN and the WTO threaten any states which use economic sanctions with immediate disbarment from these organizations and their only usage should be when a state uses economic sanctions in the first place.
That is to say, if the US were to sanction a state like guatemala, it would then be justified for all other states to sanction the USA to end economic sanctions.
All other usage usages it should be outright banned.
Two arguments for why this is a good idea.
First, sanctions do not work.
Now this is incredibly important because is a as a tool of war, they cause huge loss of life and massive amounts of harm.
So if they don't work to actually create change they should just be abandoned.
Now there are two two and a half criteria for when economic sanctions work.
First, there must be universal support.
This is never achievable because all states have different political agendas and we live in a multi-polar world that is to say, the united states has different incentives than canada, mexico, the UK, and the EU writ large as well as russia and china.
Any single state that is sanctioned will be able to find a variety of allies in other states which means that a single state's economic sanctions will simply boost trade relations between other states causing no good outcomes.
The second criteria, or second set of criteria is the state being sanctioned either needs to have a desire to work with the west and work with the states that are sanctioning it or have the inability to turn inwards.
Now if it has no desire to work with the west, it generally will not respond to sanctions even if they are universal.
This is because they can simply turn inwards and fund its own goods.
If we were to sanction russia, literally every state on earth that would produce all of its own food, all of its own energy, and generally be able to operate effectively without the support of other states.
This means that both these criteria are a single one of these criteria must be fulfilled for these sanctions to work alongside the universality.
Because it's unlikely that any state on earth will actually meet these criteria, sanctions will just not work and hurt people in the long term.
Additionally, they breed contempt which further reduces the incentives of governments to actually kowtow to sanctions.
For instance, when we sanction iran, it is unclear why there's a link between a nuclear program and economic sanctions as such, the people of the state dislike the USA more and are actually going to support anti-USA actions like continuing in nuclear program as such, they do far more harm than good.
My second argument is that they are unjust.
First, they hurt the lowest off in society.
When a state switches from their primary trading partner to a secondary trading partner things like wheat, things like bread, energy, increase in costs by ten, fifteen percent.
For rich people this causes no real change in quality of life but for people making cents per day, this can lead to starvation and death as such, it is unjust to hurt the poorest in society simply cause you want the whole society to change particularly because the poorest don't usually have enough political power to cause the actions which justified the sanctions in the first place.
Additionally, it generally breeds alternatives to the state.
Not only does it mean that you'll turn to other states for help, you're likely to look inwards to build your own goods and as such, you will all that you will do it cause distortion in the market reducing overall efficiency.
For this reason, that we should end the use of economic sanctions."
"Atheism is the only way.
So, what we mean by this is that one ought not believe in an omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent god.
So a god who's all knowing, all powerful, and always good or just.
So basically, don't believe in the god of the bible or the koran.
Two big arguments for this on our side.
The first is about the problem of evil.
So this is an idea first proposed I think by the greek philosopher epicurus, who said that given that the world is an evil place full of terrible things, it is impossible that there should be a god who is all knowing, all powerful, and always good.
Here's why.
If there were such a god who is all knowing, then that god would understand the nature of evil in the world, would understand that there are people who are dying from easily preventable illnesses, people are being treated in awful ways, genocide is occurring, the world is a terrible place.
And if this god is all powerful, then the god could step in and end that at any given time, god could snap its fingers and everyone around the world would be delivered from suffering, there'd be no more hunger, no war, no pain, and it would be instantaneous.
And if that god were always good, then clearly they would choose to do so, because evil is the antithesis of good.
So we can see that it's impossible that there should be a god who has these powers, because we observe that evil exists.
Now the best thing that the other side could say, would be to retort that it is not for human beings to decide what is good or evil, that we must defer to god and believe that god has a plan and that there's a reason for all the evil that we see.
But we think that given that this god presumably created the universe, because nothing could create this sort of being other than itself, given that this god created the universe, it could have chosen to create a universe where none of this evil was necessary.
So even if, within the confines of our world, it was a requirement that there be genocide and things like that, god could just as well have created a world where we had cotton candy to fulfill that role instead.
So we think that it's patently absurd for people to believe that such a god exists, when the physical evidence is all around us.
That it does not.
So even if there is some sort of divine being with lots of power over us, it can't be what we call god in this debate, because it is choosing not to end hunger and genocide and all of these other terrible things, and so we win the debate.
But our second argument, even if you don't believe in that, is that one ought be skeptical.
What do I mean by this?
It is impossible to observe god.
Christians believe that god can only be known through faith alone, muslims similarly believes that god's nature is mysterious.
So we see that one cannot come to know god through science, you can't find god in a laboratory.
We think that you ought be skeptical of anything that you can't observe in the physical universe.
It is perfectly plausible that there is a giant teacup on the far side of jupiter, and that we are unable to observe this teacup because it's hidden from us by the planet, and our probes have just missed it because in their orbits of jupiter they happen to always be at the opposite side from the teacup.
But why would we believe in such a thing, that's silly.
So, in the same way, it's impossible to prove that god doesn't exist, but that's not a reason to believe that he does.
It's impossible to prove that the teacup doesn't exist, but it's impossible to prove that it does.
And there's no inherent reason to believe in either.
It may be the case that we have a cultural predilection towards believing in god and not in giant floating teacups, but that's not enough reason to say that something exists, we have a cultural predilection to believe that the sun revolves around the earth, but we can see that that's not true.
We should defer to what we can observe and avoid making statements based on what we cannot.
So because of the problem of evil and because of our own inherent skepticism, atheism is the only way.
Thank you."
"We should subsidize investigative journalism.
So just to give a little bit of a model, we think that this subsidy should be based simply on past history.
We think we would give it out to people that have done good investigative work in the past, investigative work that's been acclaimed by other journalists in the field rather than just politicians, and we wouldn't stimulate the the type of subsidy that's that's being given out.
It wouldn't be based on doing x number of reports, or or investigating x topic, it would be just a blank statement and a check that we give to these businesses in these investigative units based on past success.
Alright, two reasons why investigative journalism is so important and why we need more of it in our society today.
The first is because it provides an incredibly important and unique check on politicians, and the second is because our modern circumstances in a day and age of social media and fake news, we need fact finding investigation now more than ever.
Okay, so on politicians: it it's just simply the case that politicians and political leaders have an immense amount of power and ultimately a large amount of discretion as to how they're going to use that power.
Yes it's the case that politicians are checked by voters and politicians are able to be removed from office, but in most cases unless things that are incredibly illegal are done people are able to maintain their power for long stretches of time.
Well, checks in the government obviously exist even outside of voting.
There's checks between the branches of government and checks as far as regulations, we would say that the press serves as a means of shedding light from the outside in an unskewed manner.
And we think there are certain things that the press can uncover that oftentimes are not checked for by the government or by the bureaucracy.
So what are these types of things?
First they're able to break scandals.
There are certain instances in which political leaders are doing things like money laundering money laundering, accepting bribes, committing fraud, all of these types of things that happen and goes goes by the wayside, their colleagues don't notice it.
And these are things that steal money from taxpayers and ensure that a representative is doing their job any counterproductive manner.
Investigative journalism can also do a deep dive into bureaucracy, covering issues that otherwise are unknown to the public.
Take john oliver for example, and how he is able to put together an investigation that's based on the work of other investigative journalists around the country, who are able to uncover things like civil asset forfeiture and do a deep dive into how the government works and how policies behave, and how those policies do serious damage to real life people.
And finally they can they can uncover covert operations that may be breaking international law.
Again, the investigation that goes around things like the snowden leaks.
Things that enhance leaks that are coming out, and otherwise couldn't happen without hardcore investigative journalism.
All of these things, we would say, are are bad things that the government does with little other check aside from the press.
Given that this is the case, we think that it is incredibly important that the press is funded well and that investigative journalism especially is subsidized.
So secondly, why is it so important now?
More news outlets than ever exist.
Many of them are blogs, online only, and not credible, but they're easy to paint themselves as credible.
It's very easy to put on a veneer of legitimacy especially online.
We think that subsidizing real deep investigative journalism ensures that there are reliable sources that people can look to to get information about what's going on in the world today and get hard hitting facts about how the world is behaving, how our political leaders are behaving, and they're able to make more informed decisions moving forward.
They're able to vote in ways that are more reflective of what they actually desire.
They're able to organize and and be active in society in a way that is more informed.
They're able to go about their day knowing that someone is checking politicians and knowing that someone is looking out for them, not just for the interests of the elite.
For these reasons, we should subsidize investigative journalism."
"We should ban fast food.
What we're talking about specifically in this debate is we're gonna focus primarily on fast food chain restaurants, things like mcdonalds, subway burger king, anything that's a chain restaurant that primarily deals in giving food either through delivery, take away or through very quickly giving food, these types of restaurants.
We're going to talk about banning those fast food restaurants and why we think those are negative to the overall health of society.
So, we wanna start by just pointing out the obvious.
That fast food chains are in general, terribly unhealthy.
Even the healthy options in restaurants like mcdonald's, burger king and subway, so as their salads that come with high amounts of sugar, really terrible dressings for you, fried chicken, and other types of things that overall, don't make the healthy options on these menus any less detrimental to your health than getting a burger, or a bacon cheeseburger, anything awful that you could get at one of these restaurants.
These things are high in fats, sugars, cholesterol, calories, and are largely consumed by children and families, which we think, only makes the impacts, the negative health impacts of these things all the worse when they're being consumed by people that are most vulnerable and are in most need of a healthy and balanced nutritional diet.
So why do we think that we should ban fast foods?
We think that people in the status quo, because of fast food, choose to opt for the quicker option rather than the time it takes to prepare food.
On average the time it is taken to prepare food in the american household has gone down dramatically over the past two or three decades, and we think that the best way to combat that is to take away this option and to force people to try and make healthier decisions.
People argue that banning fast food leads to harm such as people having to pay overall more money for food, but recognize that, healthy alternatives and healthy options and supermarkets exist and that, these options, the ability to buy a loaf of bread, the ability to buy a bag of apples, things like this, are not dramatically more expensive than going to a fast food restaurant where you already need to pay taxes, and you're already being forced to spend upwards of five or ten dollars.
We think with comparable cost you can still be able to feed yourself when you're going to these restaurants uhh when you go to a supermarket, and when people compare speed we think that most meals are not necessarily needed to be eaten in five minutes, that they don't need to be at this speed, but if they do, you can again prepare these things yourself in a healthier manner.
The comparison is you can make a sandwich in five minutes in your house, or you can go to mcdonald's and buy a cheeseburger.
We think that the sandwich you make at your health, your house, is probably going to be on balance the same cost and the same amount of time it's going to take you, but it's going to have way fewer health hazards to you in the long run.
We think that this forces people to get healthier both we both, at their homes but also away from their homes.
So if people still choose to go out to eat when you remove fast food as an option, we think you go to restaurants in which the food is better handled, the nutritional standards are higher, and you're more likely to get a more balanced meal or even if not a more balanced meal, a meal in which the storage preparation in handling the food is of a higher quality to ensure that things like illnesses and disease aren't transferred by the foods that the masses are eating.
We think that this is crucial given the obesity epidemic that exists in our world today.
Childhood obesity rates are the highest they've ever been and are only going up, same with adult obesity rates.
We think that fast food and the culture surrounding fast food, is a major reason for this issue, and we think that when you eliminate fast food as an option, it forces these trend lines to change.
It forces people to make better and healthier decisions, not just because they, not because they want to, because as we see in the past and as we've seen through these rising trend lines, people don't want to make this change,.
We think it's up to the government and it's necessary for the government in consideration with its people's health and its people's needs to change what they're able to eat, to make this change on what people are able to serve and to better educate people along with making a change that doesn't allow them to get the least healthy options available.
Given that fast food restaurants present no healthy options and no way for people to make reasonable choices about their body, represent a hugely difficult trade off when you compare price cost in time in an ever quickening world, you need to force people to make this change themselves, and that's why we would ban fast food."
"The motion for today's debate is that prenatal diagnosis ought be mandatory.
First some framing.
Yes, we admit on side government that a large majority of these tests are going to come out negative.
But we think the fact that you can save a few lives, that you can make a few lives easier with regards to prep, is always going to outweigh.
Because in the end, this test is going to be harmless, but having these having having the knowledge of how to prep for your baby's soon care is always going to be more important.
But secondly, on the debate about whether we care about the parents' rights or the child's more, we think that it is always more important to prioritize a child's safety and a child's long-term well-being above a parent's short-term bliss before the emotional damage of hearing the disease of your child has.
We think at the point the child's defenseless, less mature and more and more likely to get this potential harm, we always prioritize what's going to be best for them.
Two main areas of clash: first on why better prep is both better for the family and better for the baby.
First, let's talk about prenatal care, because we think that something that prenatal diagnosis gives is the ability to better control the environment that your child is in before they are born.
Because a lot of diseases are controllable or manageable or the progression can be stopped by changing the way that you behave while your child is still in utero, things like changing your diet, changing your lifestyle.
All of these seem microscopic but actively change the way that your child develops, and we think that having a prenatal diagnosis allows you to change the way that you live your life in order to better like work with the baby.
We think that it is often crucial to stop or control the progression early and actively changes at the way the child can live the rest of their lives.
But second, let's talk about the prep for postnatal.
Because we think doing things like being able to save money for costly treatments that occur after the child is born, organizing childcare, buying material so that you don't have to scramble the last second to make sure that the things your child needs to survive are in their bedroom, all of these are ways to spread out the burden over time and are only accessible when you have a prenatal diagnosis.
We think the problem on their side of the house is that sometimes parents are scared, and they say, no, because they are afraid of the potential results and want to believe that their child is healthy.
We think that you ought burst this bubble because in the end, you're going to be able to prep for your child's like existing in this world and prevent that last minute scrambling better on our side of the house.
But also, we think that in the end, it allows them to prep emotionally.
We think that we prefer a world in which parents get an earlier shock, but it is less intense, because they now have the entire rest of the pregnancy to prepare than when they get it all at once as the child is being born, and they have to juggle all of these responsibilities the same time as dealing with the massive emotional harm.
Our second area of clash is why we think we make this process cheaper and more accessible to other people on our side of the house.
We think making something mandatory necessitates making something affordable.
We think that on our side of the house, you're going to have government-subsidized funding for this.
You're going to have corporations that recognize that this is now there is now a demand for it and work on producing cheaper technology.
You're going to have programs that even if the government doesn't subsidize, are going to be willing to subsidize it for you.
All of these are things that allow for this to become accessible to individuals who just couldn't do it before.
Because in addition to the emotional reason, we think sometimes people say no to prenatal diagnosis simply because they cannot afford it.
And so, if we show you that we are able to create a society in which more people are able to afford a prenatal diagnosis, we think this is always going to be more important than any one individual's rights or one individual preference, as long as we show you that it's going to be long-term cheaper, long-term more accessible, and long-term more helpful for society.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban abortions.
A few things to keep in mind, we think that this is most likely to occur in a world, where there is cheap and accessible birth control, we're not in the habit of arguing, that women should never have rights over their body, we just think that when you have easily preventable methods of birth control before you, you should have the responsibility to not get pregnant in the first place.
Obviously, abortion should also be allowed in situations, where it is life and death for the mother.
So, if not having an abortion means that you will die during childbirth, or will significantly impede your health, we think that abortion is justified in those situations, or in situations of rape, where the person was not consenting to having sex in the first place, we would definitely allow abortions in those situations as well.
Two many areas of clash, first on why life starts at conception.
We tell you that, just because someone begins as a clump of cells, does not mean that those clumps of cells do not constitute life.
If anything, we think that the clump of cells that humans start as constitute a phase of our life, in the same way that I go through the phase of being a teenager, or the phase of being an infant.
What this means more than this though, we tell you that, if you leave that clump of cells alone, the fact that a baby will be born, constitutes that there is life in terms of potentiality.
We think that potentiality also matters, insofar as I have to start somewhere.
Just because you start as a clump of cells, does not take away from who you will become.
Like maybe, I am like currently we think that people like can develop in very amazing ways, we think that just because someone starts off as like one thing, that we acknowledge the way, that they change in the future, still constitutes that person.
More than this though, we think that just because it cannot communicate personhood, does not detract from its personhood.
Recognize, that in current society we give rights to those who are comatose, or mentally lacking, or mentally ill.
And, in so far as we have insofar as these are also groups of people, who are like not very responsive, who are absolutely unresponsive in the majority of the time, and not practically contributing to society at that moment, we think that this is very similar, and you should thus prevent the termination of life.
Our second area of class has to do with why we have special protections, to those who cannot protect themselves.
Because, just because a fetus cannot speak for themselves, does not mean that they don't deserve rights.
If anything, it means that they deserve to have rights more.
The government, in general, was created because we protect the rights of those who cannot protect themselves.
Just because someone is bigger or stronger than me, does not mean that I deserve to have my rights taken away by them, because they can overpower me.
Same goes for a baby.
Just because it is currently incapable of supporting itself, without the help of a mother, does not mean that it does not need to be protected.
As such, its rights need to be legislated, in order to make sure those protections still exist, even when there is not someone there to enforce it.
In a world where where birth control exists, in a way that is easily accessible and cheap, there's no reason that a baby should be able to still occur.
At the point that one does, we think that there is a measure of culpability upon the individual bearing that child, insofar as they consented, like they consented to not using birth control properly, and now this child exists.
We think that at the point that this is true, you want you ought protect these child's rights, given that there are also other options for a mother after birth, that mean that she does not have to take care of the child afterwards.
So, like say that I really don't want to have this baby, after you have it, you can still give it up for adoption, you can still give it up to other people, like, there is no reason that you ought be having an abortion at the point that you don't have to take care of the child in the future, and it is not an economic strain.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should fight against illegal immigration.
So before I get into my case, I just want to briefly explain what we mean by this.
We think that government should invest more money in preventing people from overstaying their visas and also that they should make available more ways for people to legally come to their country.
Some countries like the united states are basically impossible to move to for most people who want to do so because of quotas that disfavor the countries where most immigrants come from.
So basically in the united states it's much easier to move here from france than it is from mexico and the system was set up deliberately by politicians who wanted to keep out people from less developed or quote unquote undesirable countries.
So we think that those policies should be changed as part of the way that we fight illegal immigration.
But our first reason why we need to fight illegal immigration is that ultimately it creates a perpetual underclass in our society.
The united states economy as it exists right now, could not function without illegal immigrants.
These people work well below the minimum wage and do jobs that other people are just unwilling to do for instance a lot of prep work in kitchens which is very time consuming, relatively difficult, and unrewarding work is done by illegal immigrants who are paid well below the minimum wage by cheap restaurant owners.
The very low cost of eating at restaurants in the united states could not be sustained without these wages but at the same time it comes at a huge cost of creating an underclass of people who don't make enough money to really provide for their family and who are trapped and can't move up in the world because they don't have proper papers to get a job that would check their background.
So ultimately what happens is people come to the united states for a better life and maybe they get it, but they don't have the standard of living that we've deemed the minimum acceptable in the united states even once they get here because employers are so readily able to take advantage of people who don't have their proper papers in order.
So we need to fight against illegal immigration first and foremost out of compassion for the people who suffer from poor treatment because of their undocumented status once they get to the united states or other wealthy countries.
But next, we need to fight against illegal immigration because it's unfair to legal immigrants.
Illegal immigration creates a huge backlash to immigration in general.
Many people resent immigrants and think that immigrants are lazy or not hard working.
This doesn't make any sense because it's very difficult to immigrate to a new country and most of these people do so and immediately get jobs and work very hard.
But the narrative that or that immigrants in general don't deserve to be in a particular country is strengthened by the prevalence of illegal immigration.
If there are lots of undocumented people coming into your country without getting the proper papers, then it's easy to tar everyone with the same brush and assume the worst even of legal immigrants.
So lots of people who legally move to this country from latin america, to the united states that is, are assumed unfairly not to deserve to be in this country even if they went through the exact same immigration processes that someone coming from france or britain would go through.
More stringent processes indeed than the ones that my ancestors would have gone through in the early twentieth century.
But the final reason why we need to fight against illegal immigration is because ultimately border control is just not sustainable.
Right now our solution to illegal immigration is to put a bunch of guys in trucks out on the border and have them drive around like cowboys and pretend that they're doing something good.
We need to take greater action to prevent illegal immigration so that we don't have to spend all this money because it leads to a lot of violence on the border and also fuels this economy of people called coyotes who can smuggle you in past US border control and again, that leads to more violence and more suffering.
So we think that we need to fight against illegal immigration ultimately to help the people trying to come to this country and those already in it.
Thank you."
"The american jobs act brought more good than harm.
What the american jobs act was was a bill passed under the obama presidency that did a few things during a time of economic stagnation.
One, it increases the time that people could stay on unemployment insurance so it allowed for a broader social safety net to be cast for individuals, two, it gave tax incentives for businesses to hire individuals who had been unemployed for a long period of time, including those who had lost their unemployment benefits, and three, it created taxes on the wealthiest corporations and people to ensure that all these systems could be paid for.
Thus, it created very little gain to the deficit.
So, with that in mind, we're gonna talk about why this was firstly, obviously good for economic and job growth, secondly, fair, and third, why any sort of deficit increase simply doesn't matter.
So first thing on job growth.
The reason that this had occurred is because during the first stimulus bill in two thousand nine in which president obama came into office, the stimulus bill by most economists, most economists experts would agree was not large enough.
The recession had been too great, stagnation had been too great, and the spending that the government should have done at that time should have been greater.
This compensated for that.
At the time, unemployment had stalled at around the same level for a few months, and the growth rates prior to that had not been so drastic, and what we see now is that job growth has grown tremendously.
That we're at an unemployment rate that's around the natural rate of unemployment around forty five percent, and even if you take into account people that have stopped looking for jobs, those numbers are still much better than they were prior to the passing of this bill.
But more importantly, what this bill also allowed to have happen, was that when the market reaches full employment or comes close to full employment, it has led to median incomes rising, wages rising for the first time in nearly a decade.
American workers of the middle class are for the first time since the recession finding wages go up.
Because when the economy is at full employment, labor becomes, the demand for labor becomes greater, people aren't able to hire as freely and thus they need to raise wages in order to attract a better workforce and this is what the bill also allowed to have happen.
And if the bill didn't pass, if unemployment benefits had remained, it would have been much more easy for people to offer lower wages, take people who are desperate into work but rather this created a larger safety net and allowed for more steady and also more progressive growth in the long run.
Secondly, on fans.
We think that prior to the introduction of this bill that the taxation level and even still the taxation level on the wealthiest in society is too low.
Recognize that the recession that caused these lack of jobs was almost entirely due to bad loaning practices of banks and to an economic system that was betting against the lower class.
Given that this is the case, and that these people are able to in large part profit from the bailouts of the past and profit from society even without taking the bailout into consideration more than anyone else, we think that it is only just that these people be forced to pay for the harms that occurred in the past and that also made it possible for us to take on more unemployment benefits to give more benefits to people that actually needed help at the time rather than millionaires and billionaires who simply were paying a few more percentage points in their income tax.
Thirdly, very quickly, on deficit.
Given that the united states has an obscenely good credit history, that it is one of the world's largest economies, one of the world's largest trade partners and one of the most influential superpowers on the planet, we don't think that deficit actually matters, at least not in this context.
The deficit was not raised an incredible amount, our deficit percentage or the debt to GDP ratio, didn't go up by a significant amount due to this bill and in the long run if we need more credit we're going to be able to get it anyway, but this was a time in which people were really suffering.
Unemployment benefits had dried up, people weren't able to find jobs, and this bill made substantial gains in all of those areas.
And for those reasons, the american jobs act brought more good than harm."
"High school should be mandatory.
What we mean by this is that an individual would essentially be required to finish high school and if they don't they would be facing a fine.
Recognize that in this this really isn't much of an additional burden.
In the status quo it is already the case that's high school is mandatory for minors so the only issue becomes when individuals turn eighteen in their junior or senior year, and then choose to drop out of high school because they are adults and no one can control them.
So we think that we should be making those adults stick it out, or creating a very large incentive for those adults to stick it out, by doing things like imposing a fine or imposing some kind of punishment.
We don't really care about the nature of it but we want to be strong enough to require individuals to be in high school.
Three main arguments: first on promoting basic education.
We think that there are multiple reasons that just having an education is valuable.
Of course first and foremost among them is that in the status quo it is really difficult to get a job without at least a high school diploma.
That is to say even a high school diploma at this point is almost not enough to get something that is stable and high paying but if you want to access anything close to that you have to at least have a high school diploma.
So if you don't graduate from high school you're basically stuck with jobs that are either like cashier work or very like very low paying minimum wage jobs that are very unfulfilling.
So, but we also just think that education has intrinsic benefits in other ways.
It allows you to have a better understanding of the world and to critically think more effectively.
But also it does things like gives you the ability to vote and make political decisions more intelligently because everybody takes that like high school social studies class or civics class.
And like hears the criticisms of our government, and learns how to do things like research.
And we also think that a lot of the time high school breeds this desire for knowledge.
It teaches you that learning can be really fun and really engaging and that you can choose subjects that you have preferable to yourself.
And we think that it's just good for the country to promote having citizens like this.
We think that critical thinkers are what make the world go round and even if you stop at high school the fact that you got that far, the fact that you can be intellectually savvy or like have the right language to engage in higher social circles is really important.
Because it allows you to have that upward mobility and it allows you to participate in society as a more fulfilled citizen.
Our second arguments is about creating adults with options.
High school degrees open doors to options even if someone doesn't want anything directly after high school.
What we mean by this is that if I drop out of high school and ten years down the line I decide that I want to do something with my life besides whatever I was currently doing, that like maybe requires trade school or college, it is really hard to get into those things if I didn't have a high school diploma all those years ago.
It would mean that I'd have to start the GED process, which tends to be long and difficult, and still doesn't mean as much as a high school diploma does.
So, we think that just making sure that individuals get that out of the way when they are young means that ten years down the line when they're older and have less options they don't have to be trapped.
By that they can do things like go to college or go to trade school.
A lot of these programs require high school diplomas that in the past didn't.
So in the past you could go to a trade school or a two year program without a high school diploma, and that is something that is changing right now because of the fact that we have so many individuals who want these things and like these programs want people who they think are better so they require that high school diploma.
Our third argument is about keeping people self sufficient.
We think there's an intersection between individuals who drop out of high school and those that end up relying on government assistance we want to prevent that from happening.
So we think it's good to mandate high school because you're just less likely to end up in poverty, less likely to end up needing help.
Proud to propose."
"We should legalize organ trade.
When we're talking about organ trade, we're talking about a system in which people can really buy and sell organs as they see fit.
We're only going to put in a few restrictions, and that's going to be our model.
So, first, we're going to say you have to be over the age of eighteen in order to do this.
You have to be a legal adult in order to sell your organs organs.
Secondly, there are going to be minimum values set on the market that are proportional to what those organs are likely to be worth if there were some sort of free and open market.
And secondly, there's going to be a psychiatric evaluation to ensure that people that are giving the organs are in the right state of mind and in order to minimize coercion.
So, two main arguments.
The first is that this is the best solution to a massive organ shortage, and the second is against coercion, which we think is the largest argument that people lob against programs like this generally.
So, let's talk about that shortage.
In the status quo, there's a huge organ shortage.
There are many people with little with and there's very little possibility of correcting this in the status quo.
There's simply not enough people that volunteer to be organ donors and many of those who do, only give theirs their organs course post-mortem, which means that something may be wrong with those organs, that there may not be enough time between their death and the deterioration of those organs to use them, or they may have died because those organs failed them, which means they're not valuable to put in anyone else.
This dooms many people who are living right now on the organ transplant list and means that many people are going to die, simply because people will not give.
So what's another alternative solution?
Well, you could force people to give.
You could make it so that when you die, you must give your organs, mandatory post-mortem organ donation.
We think that this is a huge violation of bodily autonomy and a huge violation, and it goes against the consent of many people.
It doesn't give them an opportunity consent or one to opt out.
It also violates many religious beliefs, which we think harms those in the present and causes them fear that they're going to lose some sort of salvation in the afterlife.
We think that the sale solves.
Look, people are still going to give post-mortem organs, because some people want to give.
So it's not like only rich people are going to be able to get organ donations.
What this means is that rich people can buy organs, taking them off the waitlist and leaving more spots for everyone else to get the organs from those that remain.
And we'd say that oftentimes, you don't even need both of your organs or full organs, like a liver, to live, like having two kidneys, and this offers an avenue for people to make precious money that could be a huge difference in their lives.
This is when the coercion argument comes up, and people say that this type of a system is massively coercive.
Many on the other side argue that this is coercive because poor people are just going to give their organs for money and that these people are going to be forced to because they're poor.
Very unnuanced argument.
Three arguments in response to that: first, if that's the case, we would say the whole economic system is coercive.
There's no reason that this is any more coercive than forcing people to spend most of their lives and most of their time working at dead-end jobs.
Secondly, poor people have more agency than that.
They know their organs are valuable, and they also know that selling their organs could mean that they lose they have some sort of health risk in the future, so they're not just going to give willy nilly.
And finally, this is a comparatively less coercive solution than any of the others that are proposed to solve the organ problem.
It's a balance of free market solution that balances the need for us to get more organs, to save more lives of people that are dying, and the rights of people to choose not to give.
It finds that balance and for these reasons, we should legalize organ trade."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should prohibit flag-burning.
Before we get into our independent points, this is a reminder that the government has an obligation not just to maintain the rights of the people but also to maintain the pragmatic good of that society and that country.
Sometimes this does mean sacrificing certain rights for the greater safety of society.
So as long as we show you that this is an ineffective form of protest that can be easily substituted by other more legal things in society and we show you that it comes with real pragmatic harms, we win this debate.
Two main areas of clash.
The first on why flag-burning is always a call to violence.
One of the ways by which we say it is okay to ban a freedom of speech, which is something that op is going to come up here and claim that flag-burning is, is if we show you that that is that that speech in in is inherently harmful to others around.
This for example is why it is okay to ban someone yelling fire in a crowded theater because if they do so and people start stampeding out and some people get squushed, this is incredibly harmful to others.
This is also why we were able to ban communist calls to violence on pamphlets because the but not the actual existence of the communist manifesto itself because the call to violence is what would harm others.
So a lot of people have very deep emotional times to the united states flag / when they see someone burning a flag they have a very aggressive and usually violent reaction because of these deep emotional ties.
This is because the flag itself is a symbol of the country and those who feel passionately about being a citizen of the united states oftentimes get incredibly upset if they see that symbol being harmed or desecrated in any way.
Given that this violates the standard by which freedom of speech should not cause harm to others, we think that the fact that people have a right to be safe and that violence is bad for society outweighs it.
But even if you think that it's still a good way by which one can express and some harm is fine as long as you still have a way of expressing it, we tell you that people's unhappiness with a country or country's actions can be can be done in a much more effective manner than by burning the flag.
Recognize that if anything, burning the flag often shuts down the communication before it has even begun because of how personal the flag is to individuals.
They see someone burning it and the next step is and they no longer want to have a conversation because that symbol was harmed.
If you want the attention of government bodies, you can do so in other ways through protests, through strikes, through sit-ins, and all of these will catch attention in an equal manner.
Our second area of clash has to do with why the flag is an infinite memorial.
There are certain sites designated within the united states and other countries as memorials for certain soldiers or certain battles, but not everyone gets a memorial and those that don't are represented by the flag.
Given the flag is a symbol of the nation and many people extrapolate this to being a representation of all those who died for the country, these we would say that it is equivalent to any other memorial for any other soldier or any other battle.
These memorials are protected legally from any kind of desecration and the same protection should apply to the flag.
For this is why for example you can still stage protests outside these kinds of memorials but if you go up to them and start destroying them, this isn't this is no longer a freedom of expression because you were desecrating the honor and the honor of those who like are represented by that memorial and also destroying the property of the united states government.
As such we think that the flag ought have the same protections both as a memorial for all the soldiers who died fighting for the united states, but also as a piece of property and symbol of the united states government.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"-limit genetic testing.
What we mean by this is that we would still allow genetic testing for direct disease identification, to identify carriers, like if you're going to have a baby and you know you have a history of cystic fibrosis, we would still want genetic testing in those situations but we wouldn't allow like pervasive general genetic testing that scans the human's entire genome and then displays like risks and things like that, which is a form of testing that has gone grown increasingly popular with gene therapy but that we think is actually incredibly pernicious.
So first an overview on how this kind of testing actually works.
Because it doesn't show you something that is like a hundred percent guaranteed to happen in the future.
Rather it pinpoints specific genes that link to a probability of future development.
So there might be multiple genes associated with schizophrenia and you might come up positive for one of them, and there might be a fifty fifty percent chance that it causes it in the future.
But the problem is that the way that humans interpret this data is: "" oh no.
I have the gene for schizophrenia.
That means I'm going to be schizophrenic. ""
And we think that like what that does mean like what this is is not a complete science that is good for humans to have access to.
Two main areas of clash, first on preventing discrimination.
Under this we want to talk about health insurance first.
Because recognize that your health data gets shown to your health insurance companies almost automatically and it becomes really easy to refuse coverage on the basis of things like this.
Like there's already a section that allows insurance companies to refuse protections based on pre existing conditions.
And we think what happens under their side of the house is that that becomes massively expanded based on this idea that like: "" look, your genes show this probability, we don't want to assume that risk for you so we're gonna call it a pre existing condition because you knew about it before you got to the insurance company. ""
This becomes really problematic generally for people who want to maintain coverage, but it becomes especially problematic if I'm someone who needs to switch jobs or carriers for any reason.
Like we think the problem that happens on their side of the house is that there always stuck in this situation where it might not be helpful to the individual, but it's going to be very dangerous once insurance companies get a hold of it.
Our second argument under this is about employers.
Like recognize that employers in the status quo are already risk averse when it comes to hiring.
This is why it's often really hard to get them to hire women who they're afraid you're going to get pregnant.
Or they don't like to hire old people because they're afraid they're going to be obsolete.
And so we think that what they do on their side of the house is that if employers get a hold of this information they are infinitely more likely to discriminate based on your future health as well.
Like what employer wants the potential of someone becoming a schizophrenic or catching cancer and no longer being able to work on their side of the house?
So, we think that like as a privacy kind of decision, to make sure that these things don't become weaponized against the people who are trying to learn more about themselves, it shouldn't happen.
Our second area of clash is about security.
Recognize that the aggregation of very personal data is a very high risk of being released.
And people love to do the thing where they're like: "" oh man.
Like this stuff never gets hacked. ""
But we've seen recently more and more that that like data security is not very real.
Like with the hack of intel, with national health service in britain, with equifax.
Like everyone thought that this was impossible but it's just not.
So we think what happens on their side of the house is that it's infinitely more likely that someone gets a hold of this very personal data, that it leaks out to employers etcetera.
But finally we want to talk about preventing overreaction.
Because recognize the majority of diseases aren't guaranteed.
Their partially dependent on the environment.
So my knowledge that my knowledge of like that I might have x disease in the future, probably influence the amount of stress that I experience or what I do from then on.
So we think that oftentimes these end up self like propagating prophecies.
Proud to propose."
"We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms.
We think that this is probably modeled within the united states, but we're fine like defending this on a global standard.
All of our arguments are generalizable, and we think that, basically, we're just not going to allow any kind of gun ownership.
Like, obviously, BB guns, like small toy guns are fine, but like we think that we draw the line at anything that has bullets that can be dangerous.
Three main areas of clash: first, on security.
I think, first, it is empirically true that countries that have abandoned the right to bear arms show much lower crime rates.
We see this in the netherlands.
We see this in israel.
Like although they still have other forms of violence, knife, etcetera, there is nothing quite as deadly as like a gun in its ability to kill you much more quickly or even if you're not effective at using it, and so we see that gun violence like decreased considerably and as such, the like amount of damage that someone suffers has also decreased considerably.
So the crimes that they do have tend to be non-lethal a lot more.
This logically makes sense, right?
Like it is infinitely easier to hurt someone with a gun than it is with almost any other item, including a knife.
Like, it doesn't require the same kind of short-range interaction that a knife would have that is more likely to put the assailant in danger as well.
It is much less likely to be utilized in gangs and things like that.
Like, we think the problem, on their side of the house, is that they are always defending an article that has been created for the destruction of other people, and so the problem is that even when you are trying to use it in non-lethal ways, even when you are trying to license gun owners, once you don't ban it entirely, it is always likely to slip through.
Like we think that once it's banned, it's it's a lot easier to regulate it en masse, because then you don't have to deal with things like forged licenses or like unregistered weapons, like these kinds of things stop mattering at the point that nobody is allowed to have any.
Like we think even if you don't buy any of that logically, we think the fact that accidental deaths happen with guns is just enough to win the round already.
Like the fact that a five-year-old can take a gun and shoot someone on accident and hurt them, even when they didn't mean to, is enough reason to abandon all gun rights entirely, because it means that there are always going to be innocents who are harmed in the process, and we just don't understand what the benefit of guns is in the first place.
But secondly, we want to talk about the culture of violence, because we think that america is specifically a country that has glamorized guns beyond belief.
We are the country of freedom and the right to own a gun and people will defend that to the end, even if it costs lives, even if it has large amounts of school shootings.
Like we think this seeps into our schools, it sheeps into our children, it normalizes incredibly dangerous behavior.
Like, we think the problem on their side of the house is that when you establish this is a right, you're essentially establishing the right of individuals to be violent and the right of individuals to defend themselves in the face of violence.
But what it means to defend yourself or when a gun ought be used is still up to every single individual making that decision.
So, we think that what happens on their side of the house is that you're always going to have more violent behavior because you've built it into the system of laws that we have.
So, no, no like they don't get to complain when they end up with columbines or other school shootings, because this is the culture that you have created and this is the culture that you are propagating.
We also think this has a really important implication when it comes to police.
Like we think a large reason that police are trigger-happy is because they're afraid of the other person having a gun.
And if you don't have that fear, if you know that this person was unlikely to be able to obtain a weapon then because it's illegal, then you're less likely to be trigger-happy.
But even if you're not less trigger-happy, the way that it stands up in court also matters in that it is a lot more difficult for police to use this fear as a defense when the jury can just say, "" well, guns are illegal, so this fear was irrational in the first place.
Like, this isn't an excuse. ""
So we think that in a country that like struggles with police brutality, this becomes very important.
Proud to propose."
"We should ban foreign workers.
Companies in the united states frequently import their labor force in order to pay them far less money than skilled labor in the united states.
We believe that each country has some autonomy in deciding their labor and immigration laws, however, it is fundamentally unacceptable when a state defines labor a particular way, defines regulation a particular way, and yet a company decides to station themselves in the country and yet import cheaper labor.
We think the cost of of working in a first world country should be hiring first world workers.
It is fine if the country decides to move somewhere else, however, it is fundamentally unacceptable when it attempts to get the best of both worlds, leaving first world employees out of work, while they continue to benefit from the profoundly large markets that have developed in places like the united states.
With that in mind, we would propose the following model: that foreign work visas be ended.
People can still emigrate to the to the united states, however, as if they are in the united states purely to work, they will be asked to leave after a year or two and no further work visas will be issued.
Three arguments for why this is a good idea: first off is backlash.
We think that when a lot of people come to the united states from foreign countries, you see a lot more hate.
Unfortunately, contact with other people from other countries is almost always negative.
When you actually actually get to sit down with someone and talk with them, you do humanize them.
But when you're just driving to work every day and the person who cuts you off is from a country that isn't the united states, that's where you start to develop hate, that's where you start to develop simple biases.
We think it's particularly bad with foreign workers because: one, they are explicitly here to take united states jobs, which we think makes a lot of people angry.
Even if there are enough jobs to go around, they push down the wages that US workers can actually demand, given that foreign workers are now inflating the total supply of labor.
But secondly, we think that they largely make skilled labor in the united states angry at immigrants as well, because a lot of foreign workers that are imported to the united states are actually here for skilled labor positions.
That's where most of our h one b visas go.
As such, we think that both wealthy and poor people start to move against immigrants.
This allows both democrats and republicans to pass anti-immigrant policies, while still remaining to have power and still catering to their constituents.
This leads to things like the weakening of hate crime legislation, further restrictions on immigration, and the willingness to actually support racist policies in the parts of the country where we see far more problematic police departments.
My second argument is simply about jobs.
As I stated briefly in my introduction, we believe that each company makes a choice when they go to a particular place.
When you go to the US, you accept that you have to pay more for labor, pay more for regulations.
But you also get to benefit from a massive amount of treaties which benefit US trade, the markets in the united states where you can cater to us immediately, the lack of transportation costs to go to places like canada, mexico and US markets, and we think it's unfair to try to, say, import credibly cheap labor from southeast asia just to get around the cost of paying US workers.
This fundamentally shortchanges the united states and further disincentivizes things like improving our state of affairs or actually making it a fun or habitable place for companies to be.
My third and final argument is just about corporate responsibility.
We think that corporations are far more easy it's far easier for corporations to abuse their workers when they're foreign workers.
When your boss can essentially say, "" I will send you back to a country with a worse quality of living if you disobey me in any way, "" we think that workers have no rights.
This also spills over to US workers as a culture where there's a lack of reporting and a lack of support largely harms everyone.
For this reason, we should ban foreign workers."
"We should introduce a flat tax rate.
So here's what we're going to argue for: right now most countries around the world have a progressive tax system where, for instance, the first ten thousand dollars of your income is taxed at one rate, the second ten thousand dollars is taxed at another higher rate and so on.
We're arguing that there should be one rate for all income.
But it's a bit more complicated than that.
We're still going to allow personal deductions, which basically means that you can take a certain amount away from your tax burden, based on the number of people in your family.
This would obviously allow low income people to have a negative tax burden, which means that they would receive money back from the federal government after their deductions.
So with the system of personal deductions we would actually have a negative income tax rate for low income people.
With that in mind, we would advocate that countries replace their progressive tax rate with a flat tax rate that would bring in the same amount of income.
Two main arguments for why we think this is a good policy, one which is better than a progressive tax rate: the first is that this is a very simple tax rate, that's very difficult to evade.
One of the largest problems that governments have isn't setting a tax rate that will bring in enough revenue, it's setting a tax rate that will bring enough revenue after you have lots of people evading their taxes.
In countries like greece for instance you have, on paper, and extremely high tax rate but also a relatively low rate of people actually paying what they owe.
We tell you that a flat tax is harder to evade because ultimately it so much simpler.
The state can point to a chart with your income on it and say exactly how much you owe based on the number of people in your family, as compared to a progressive income tax rate, where people have incentives to play certain games in order to ensure that they end up in a particular bracket for instance.
At the same time the tax code is now much easier to administer.
You don't need fifty billion lawyers on hand in order to interpret the tax code if you have a much simpler one.
You can have a smaller staff, that's able to actually catch more people committing fraud with a simple flat tax rate.
And what's more, it's easier for people to plan and know what they're tax burden will be in the future, as opposed to a more complex tax code, so we think this actually allows people to plan better for their own futures.
We think on top of that, that there's less incentive to evade taxation now.
Because whereas in a country that's a highly progressive tax code you have an incentive to ensure that you don't go into a higher tax bracket, with a flat tax rate it doesn't matter how much you are earn.
You lose that incentive for people to commit fraud.
Our second argument is that ultimately this is better for low income people and people at the margin.
Right now if you are a working class person in a country with a progressive tax rate and you happen to get a bonus, suddenly your tax burden on that bonus is higher than it would have been otherwise, so you receive less on the margin than you would have if you had a flat tax in that country.
We think that although progressive tax rates are set up to help low income people, in fact they do a poor job of doing so.
While these people might pay a lower rate of tax to begin with, we think it's often arbitrary what is assessed as a fair tax burden for low income people.
We think that by allowing a system of deductions that would give some people a negative tax burden, you can completely remove the burden of funding the state from those who can least afford to bear it and instead have direct cash transfers to those people.
This can act as a supplement for certain social welfare programs or even a replacement for certain inefficient social welfare programs.
By replacing them with direct cash transfers which, many economists would argue, actually are better for families because people can allocate that money according to their own preferences rather than have some bureaucrat tell them how they're going to spend their benefit money.
So with all of these points in mind, we would argue for introducing a flat tax rate.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is: this house would subsidize biofuels.
This house, being the united states government.
Two many areas of clash, the first on the importance of government subsidization.
We tell you that new technology is incredibly expensive, and on both an individual and corporate level.
What this means is that, in order to make a system change, especially a system as ingrained in oil and gas running cars, as the american economy, there needs to be an outside impetus that shows corporations that there is an investment, and shows individuals that they can still save money in the long term.
Let's explore these two layers separately.
Recognize that on a corporate level, corporations are generally risk averse.
What this means is that, they do not pour money into things that they do not feel will bring back money to the corporation.
We tell you that, corporations recognize america's dependency on oil, recognize that they themselves cannot permeate the market, and thus do not put money into innovating new kinds of biofuels, or new kinds of biofuel running cars.
Subsidizing subsidizing biofuels would also create a market for them.
What this means is now, on an individual level, people will feel like biofuel running cars are worth the long term investment, because recognize that, with new technology, it's likely that that car is going to be more expensive than the car they currently drive.
In order to justify giving in money for this new item, they also have to justify that, in the long term, it will be cheaper.
This is the same rationale we use when people buy a car that is more expensive, but they expect to last for longer.
They know that, even though they're showing more money out in the short term, in the long term, they will end up paying less.
We tell you that, the development of a market, by means of the consumer, signals to corporations that they can invest more freely, and pump out new ideas, and new innovations.
This brings us to our second area of clash, which has to do with the harms of the oil and gas industry.
Because besides the obvious environmental impacts of upping the amount of greenhouse gases, that cause global warming, and pollute our environment, there's also an economic dependency cost.
Recognize that, the majority of powers, that holds the monopoly over oil and gas, are middle eastern and non western.
What this means is that a country such as the united states have massive dependencies on middle eastern countries, that cause their economies to be dependent on how those function.
What this means is that, if in a given year, the middle eastern country cannot produce enough oil, or decides to raise the price in order to manipulate the market, the american economy goes with it.
This is very problematic, insofar as the whim of one of the leaders of these gas or oil industries can stop the stop up america's highways for days.
But there's a second layer to this.
We tell you one of the massive reasons that america doesn't sanction saudi arabia, but is willing to sanction other countries, such as israel, is because they are not they're more afraid of saudi arabia, and the control they have over the american economy, in the form of oil.
We tell you that, if america is able to produce its own fuels, and is unafraid of the manipulation of its economy, that saudi arabia and other middle eastern countries can cause, they are more likely to step up in situations of human rights abuses.
More than in this though, we tell you that subsidizing biofuels encourages innovation.
This is good on two levels: first, we can get benefits to the domestic economy, but it also helps in the global economy.
First, on the domestic economy.
We tell you that, showing that a market exists and investing in that market signals to corporations that it's time to innovate in this sphere, in order to make more money.
What this means is that, more different kinds of biofuels, different kinds of biofuel running cars, are more likely to be developed on our side of the house, insofar as they know that they can actually sell their products.
But recognize what this does on a global market as well.
If america is able to become one of the main global players in developing their own bio fuel, and bio fuel technology, they're able to sell this to other global powers.
Given that this is a newly developing market, and a few other countries have gotten very far, we tell you that becoming one of the first allows america to build their own niche market in the global economy.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should legalize doping in sports, because first and foremost, it'll just make sports better, it'll increase the actual appreciation and quality of sports, and secondarily, because legalizing doping, I actually think, is going to be better in a lot of ways for the health and safety of athletes.
So, let's start by talking about the quality of sports improving, when you legalize doping.
I think that it's important to note, that when you're talking about sports, the primary value of sports is entertainment.
You want sports to be as entertaining as possible, you want sports to be as high quality as possible.
That's what makes sports valuable was a source of entertainment, it's the competition, the degree to which there is an appreciation for the competition, the degree to which people actually like the sport, but, also that's the way in which you grab the money from sports, that's the way in which you actually increase the amount of money, athletes, and therefore get paid.
The amount of money that you got from TV deals and of all those things.
So, it's very important that sports are of higher quality.
I think that, doping will actually lead to higher quality in sports.
First and foremost, because athletes are going to be better as a result of doping.
When you take steroids, or growth hormone, or you minimize the pain that you experience as a result of the drugs you take, all of these things are going to increase your ability to perform, and this is important, because increased performance means it's going to be a better experience for the fans.
And I think that this is why you get a lot of appreciation for these things.
So, like for example, everyone, before you found out about the doping, everyone thinks that someone like barry bonds breaking a home run record, or like someone like lance armstrong's dominance in sports, or alex rodriguez, all of these things are seen as like record breaking, it's the same reason why, say, steph curry's three point records are very exciting for sports, or or like the, because people appreciate this narrative of sports, people appreciate sports at their height, they appreciate when records are being broken, when things in sports are better than they've ever been before.
Those are the kinds of things that create excitement in sport, because they're new and they're better.
So, I think that doping is a way in which you can help move this process along, I think it does make sports better.
The only reason people think that like it's bad is because there's an idea fairness but goes away, and more people are just doing it, or because there's like a social stigma surrounded by doping.
But I think that's a pretty silly reason, like if nobody ever knew that barry bonds took steroids, people would have just thought it was incredibly cool that he did this thing, and I think that the fact he took drugs doesn't take away from how cool the performance nature actually is.
So, I think that doping actually increases the quality of sports, and that's the most important thing.
That's the first area of argumentation.
I think a secondary of argumentation is about health and safety, and I think that this is important for two big reasons: first and foremost, because when you take more directly performance enhancing drugs, that can like increase your strength, increase your stamina, things like that, I think you're less likely going to, therefore, be subject to like the daily wear and tear from sports.
You're going to be better able to resist those, like that's the whole point, like if you get stronger you're better able to do the sport effectively, but if you're stronger, you're like you have better stamina, or all those things, you're also going to probably have a reduced risk of injury and things like that, which is very important for sports, very important for athletes, very important for fans too.
There's obviously like some scientific evidence, that may be like over using steroids, or things like that, or even take them at all, could lead to these problems, but I also think that like, as medical research in these drugs get better and better, those kinds of concerns only go down over time, and this argument just becomes more more powerful as we get to a more modern age of medicine.
But, I additionally think that this applies to other things too, because as far as like a legal classifications of performance enhancing drugs are, this applies to drugs like marijuana as well, and I think that's like a big problem, because oftentimes these drugs can be used in as a replacement of like prescription opiodes.
They are oftentimes much safer, come with much lower risk of addiction, are oftentimes better able to actually effectively combat problems, all of these things are actually better for athletes.
This is why and they're less likely to be abused.
So for all those reasons, I think we should legalize doping in sports"
"We should protect animal welfare.
We think of the should scale with the consciousness of the animal so we think that mice are always going to matter less than say elephants, and we should treat the animal in accordance to what that animal presents its needs to be.
So if a dolphin needs x amount of acres to swim in because that is what keeps it healthy and fulfilled we would provide those amount of acres, but we recognize that mice just don't need that amount of space to be happy or to be comfortable so we're okay with keeping them in cages.
And we think the dolphins feel pain more acutely in the same way that monkeys do, so you put the barrier on experimenting on them a lot higher than on ferrets who just don't.
So we think it's really important to recognize that animal welfare is contextual.
It is to each animal according to that animals needs.
Not just we have to treat every animal as though it is a completely autonomous equal to human kind of being.
So two main arguments, first on the justification for the existence of animal rights.
Recognize first and foremost that consciousness, which is the most used standard by scientists and researchers in the status quo for whether or not an animal deserves rights, is true for a lot of different types of animals.
Whether we're talking about elephants that can form family bonds and have communication or we're talking about ferrets that can create loose colonies of groups that can work together into some extent.
So we think it is the case that when we recognize that these animals have varying degrees of consciousness we must treat them according to that because it is the case that we do the same with humans.
Right?
We recognize that children have less consciousness than adults so we are more comfortable with mandating things about their existence.
We force them to go to school, we give them very little control over private property.
But as they grow up in their consciousness increases in their acuteness increases, that is when we say: "" okay you are a full fledged human now.
You are deserving of full human rights. ""
So we think that what we have to keep really clear here is this line between consciousness and like non consciousness.
But even if an animal doesn't have the same kind of consciousness as a person, or nearing that, even if they can't form family bonds, we think it is still the case that that animal feels pain and wants to avoid it.
So if you pinch a mouse that mouse hurts.
It runs away from you, it doesn't want to have that anymore.
And we think that insofar as humans are like similar in that respect, we can understand trying to avoid pain, we ought allocate animals the same rights we'd prefer allocated to ourselves in that regard.
So minimizing pain, minimizing torture.
And we think of course there are instances in which we can rationalize why that pain is worth it.
So maybe if you're doing some like cancer drug treatment that will save the lives of millions of people and prevent their pain, maybe it's okay to torture a couple of mice for it.
But it's probably still not okay to torture an elephant for it because of the fact that it combines with consciousness standard.
So we think this is something that is like very fluid but we think that insofar as it exists, that is something that is important.
Our second argument is about preventing animal cruelty.
Even if you don't buy into the philosophical justification of animal rights, if you're going to acquire an animal you should maintain its welfare.
First because of obligations.
Animals become helpless when a human takes it.
It would have been fine in the wilderness but the fact that we created the dependency, we said: "" we're taking you out of that wilderness "", means that we now have an obligation and responsibility to make sure that it is not hurting significantly more than it would on its own.
We also think that this means we have to specifically make sure that animal isn't suffering because we would become the individuals who created that suffering and who caused it.
We also in this important with regard to developing the empathy of individuals.
Animal treatment is a reflection of many psyche disorders and it's important in the development of animals to see how a person or a child treats animals.
So we need to create a society in which animals are treated well to make sure that individuals are developing properly.
Proud to propose."
"We should ban gratuities.
I think we're to talk specifically about the united states, and we're talking about gratuities we mean like any service based work that would expect tips.
This includes things like taxi drivers, waiters, busboys, etcetera.
Two main areas of clash, first on raising the minimum wage of service jobs.
There's a problem in the status quo where the minimum wage of service jobs like busboys, taxi drivers, waiters, etcetera is very low because employers expect them to get tips and use this as an excuse for the government.
They're like yes because these individuals are going to get tips we should be able to pay them less because they're going to get paid off anyway.
This is really problematic because it means that people who are often forced into these positions based on a lack of alternatives can't guarantee themselves a livable existence without working absurd hours or sometimes even with working absurd hours.
Like we think that the reason that a minimum wage exists in the first place is to avoid worker abuse and to prevent individuals from having to live absurd work life balances and we think that all of this continues to exist for people who live based on tips recognizing that tips are an incredibly unstable source of income like you never know when you're going to have a good night verses a bad night and that's like a fundamental devaluing of labor compared to other areas but also we just think this represents an abuse of the individuals who get stuck living under these systems in the first place.
Like the only way we get any kind of political will to change is by removing the justification that employers use to pay their employees less which is this idea that they're going to receive gratuities anyway.
Once you're able to show that it's necessary to pay them more then you're actually going to have the political will to pay them more and we think that is awful oftentimes actually preferable than working for tips because even if it might be less at certain points in time we think on aggregate it's more but also it's just significantly more stable so you have much less periods of time where you're like yes I don't know if I'm going to be able to eat this week because my tips haven't been as good.
We think preserving the autonomy of service workers is also really important here like because they rely on tips they're forced to be nice which we think the problem is that people will be nice either way on both sides of the house like if something's your job and you don't want to get fired then you're going to be polite because that's just part of the expectation.
They don't need the extra incentive of being afraid that they're not going to receive a gratuity.
We think that it's like the problem on their side of the house is that the circumstances in which like service workers are unlikely to be nice are circumstances in which they're actually being mistreated.
So like we see a lot of the time where female waitresses get harassed by male customers based on their gender and based on their attractiveness and they always have to just grin and bear it and like work through it because they know that they're not going to get tips if they don't.
So they're often like forced to use their sexuality, forced to like go along with this embarrassing treatment regardless of whether or not they want to and we just don't think that these individual should have to put up with this treatment because they're afraid of being financially punished.
And we think this is a right the gets afforded to almost everybody else right like they'll have HR departments and if a client is being especially problematic they have a form of recourse.
Our second area of clash is about maintaining affordability.
When gratuities are expected they automatically add to the expected cost of an outing.
This becomes cost prohibitive for people who can't afford that extra money or anxious about what that expectation might be and we think that given that these people still deserve to enjoy themselves we're unsure why this happens and we think the problem is that it's not as if that like that that cost is going to be internalized if you don't have tips right like we see plenty of other countries where gratuities aren't normalized such as mexico etcetera where they don't have to work for tips because we're arm but you also don't have like highly expensive food we think that rather what happens is that corporations lie to individuals and just use it as a way to increase their profit margins in the united states and that's something that we like eliminate because they still need to be able to sell to some people.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should prohibit tower blocks.
We think that this can take place in the majority of countries, in so far as most current countries have the infrastructure, and the ability, and often do build tower-block-like structures.
Before we get into our two areas of clash, we want to flush out what the alternative looks like, because tower blocks, basically, are are made up of these very tall skyscraper-like buildings, with steel frames, a lot of concrete, very heavy, and require a lot of planning ahead of time, and a lot of upkeep overtime.
We think the alternative looks like more sprawled out communities, with houses that are kept to three to four blocks maximum, meaning you could still have multiple apartments in one house, but rather than building up, you would have to build a little bit up, and then wider out.
We think this is preferable mostly for the two areas of clash I'm about to outline.
First, I want to talk about hygiene.
Because the problem with tower blocks is that these kinds of houses are connecting oftentimes tens of hundreds of people together, with the same kind of ventilation, in very close quarters, and with very close contact.
The problem with this is that a lot of airborne diseases, and even physically like touch-borne diseases, can move between these tower blocks much more effectively than they would move between smaller houses, that are separated by like amounts of land.
Specifically, things like tuberculosis, that are incredibly infectious through vents, spread infinitely faster through tower block structures.
We think that at the point that these like, off these can propagate diseases much faster than other kinds of buildings, they ought be avoided.
More than this though, we think that tower blocks, specifically, are often used in de facto segregation to worsen the conditions of the minority groups, and those who are poor in communities.
We think that, even though you will always have some amount of de facto segregation, insofar as society is racist and likes to have the wealthy living far away from those in poverty, you can eliminate how bad this looks, by allowing for multiple small houses, that require less upkeep to still be manageable, but also don't allow the same kind of contact between groups.
More than this though, we think that it is easier to attack a tower block than it is to attack smaller areas, if only because the bomb radius is tighter together.
We think we ought that we ought to take note of attacks, such as nine eleven.
We think that it would have been infinitely harder for it to cause that much damage, if, rather than the two massive twin towers, you had smaller smaller groups, if only because there just wouldn't be as many people in that amount of space.
Our second area of clash has to do with the environment.
We think it's important to note that, unlike other kinds of buildings, tower blocks specifically have very concentrated pollutant output.
Because there are so many people living in one area, consuming all of that energy there, you're going to have much higher emissions in small areas, which causes more environmental pollutions there.
We think it's important to note that in very large cities, such as tokyo, people actively have to wear face masks, because of the amount of pollution generated by large amounts of people.
Yes, we agree cities are always going to exist, but we think by removing how high these cities can build, you necessarily expand the radius of them, which spreads the pollution out over more space, but you keep the same amount of pollution.
So, you minimize the impact on every individual, in every individual piece of land.
More that this though, we think that the heavy building materials often use compress the earth, and are geologically dangerous.
At the point that this is true, we think it is preferable to even out the amount the amount of weight across our mud banks, and across our across tectonic plates, to prevent dangerous geological situations.
We think a lot of the time, even earthquakes can be caused by things like tower blocks.
We also think that, oftentimes, tower block lead to collections of businesses, and other conglomeration.
Again, we understand that cities will always exist, but we think that spreading our cities out causes less damage.
For these reasons, proud to oppose."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should abolish open primaries in the united states.
We'll define this as both open primaries in things like presidential elections, where you just can declare what party you're voting for at the time you arrive at the poll, as well as open primaries in things like state and municipal elections, where the primary just involves you voting for any candidate and the two most you know vote getting candidates advance to a runoff final election, regardless of party.
This happens in louisiana and california for example.
Three independent points: first is sabotage voting.
So we think this is particularly pernicious at the presidential level, where essentially people will declare the other party like from the one that they are personally a member of in order to vote for a candidate they think is less viable.
This is a problem both principally and pragmatically.
Pragmatically it means that we increase the probability of just getting bad candidates at the final election or in the general, which in turn means that we just have worse representation for the country because we are being like faced with options, that is like choices in the general election, that just aren't particularly representative of what anybody wanted.
But secondly is the principled objection.
That is that it is that it is an issue when people who do not genuinely believe in a specific set of beliefs are the ones making the decision for who will proxy that group.
So, for example, republicans voting in a democratic primary are then in essence making a decision for the american left that they are and in a principled position to make.
This is an issue that brings me into my second independent point which is that parties need to know that will of their base.
So, we think that the the the main reason that primaries exist is that they exist so that we can actually tell parties: "" this is who we want to put forward "".
There's a specific portion of the american voting base that is you know democratic or republican or whatever smaller party you want to look at, and then that voting bloc essentially tells the party leadership: "" this is who we want representing our interests on a national level "".
When you have open primaries though, that fundamentally violates this principle because you distort the definition of what the base even constitutes.
You bring in lots of people that don't have a vested interest in the party and don't have a stake in what the outcome of that party is, long term, and you allow them to make the decision over who's going to proxy the will of that voting base.
We think this is inherently problematic insofar as you now have a party system that doesn't have a meaningful way to actually ensure that they are putting their best foot forward in terms of representing their constituency.
So we want a closed system that will ensure that primaries are actually a meaningful tool to proxy the will of the voters.
Our third independent point is that particularly in the open primaries that you see in state and municipal elections, they erode the capacity to represent minority viewpoints in elections.
Elections are important really for two reasons: the first is obviously to put people in power who will represent the wills and preferences of the majority but the second is just a discursive value that when you have you know people on a national or at least statewide or municipal wide stage, hashing out ideas and discussing what the best policies are, on you don't want things to fall into an echo chamber.
And I think that generally speaking, if you put two people forward that are too similar in their ideas, nothing really gets or a lot of things don't get challenged.
A lot of basic assumptions.
So if you put two democrats forward, a lot of the you know policies that they're going to endorse, they will agree on.
And there's no challenging then of those policies.
There's no public discussion of it.
We think that's inherently problematic.
So even if it doesn't perfectly mirror the will of the voters in terms of who's going to be elected, we think there's inherent value in having someone in there that might be willing to dissent against the more fundamental principles held by the other candidate.
For that reason, proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban homeopathy.
What we mean by this is that as of now, anyone found selling or advertising homeopathic products would be immediately issued a cease or desist order and any future signs of them breaking that law will result in large fines.
Too main areas of clash first, on why it is bad for the individual.
First under this, we want to talk about the economics.
So either you're a hipster who buys into homeopathy because you feel like there's something about old wives tales that is especially glamorous or you have some unknown reason to mistrust the government in which case, you are almost always overpaying for cute little hippie shops that are charging you more because they know that you are dumb enough to fall for it.
In the end, we think these people probably deserve it and we don't care about them as much but we do think that it's the case that spending money on homeopathy means they're not spending that money in meaningful ways elsewhere and it's probably still bad that they're being hoodwinked.
But we think the other alternative is that a lot of the time homeopathy is something used by people who have less economic means and they're trying to avoid the hospital costs associated with going in for for a visit.
They oftentimes buy very cheap and very very untested and unorganized products and what this means is that they are more likely to be incredibly ineffective.
This leads to two things.
First, it oftentimes you means that you are forced to buy more and more before you are forced to acknowledge that it is not a functional product but also it means that once it doesn't work you have to go to a hospital anyway and now you've essentially paid double.
We think that homeopathy is incredibly pernicious in that it purposefully advertises for those who do not have the means to go to a hospital or are likely to have a distrust of the hospital due to institutional problems such as the fact that hospitals have historically done things like sterilized people of color without their consent and so homeopathy basically takes advantage of those fears and economically takes advantage of them.
But second under this is about the physical problems that arise because the issue with homeopathy is that it does not have to meet the same rigorous standards of testing that any other kind of corporation produced drug or pharmaceutical product would have to undergo.
This means that you are much more likely to have an adverse or allergic reaction to something within the product and that it's also likely to be a missed dose of whatever potent thing is in it and so we think that you're actually more likely to require more treatment later but not just treatment for whatever you initially had a problem with, but also treatment for whatever adverse reaction you had to it afterwards and the problem is also that in so like while you're wasting your time with this homeopathic treatment, the problem itself is getting worse right.
So like if I start noticing extreme chest pains and I'm like okay well I'm going to drink some tea that was assigned to me by this homeopathic doctor person, then while I'm drinking this tea and hoping it'll get better the problem is going untreated and is actually getting significantly worse.
And we think that that's bad insofar as we could have solved this before and like certain issues when you need need to be treated relatively immediately otherwise they get a lot worse and it's actually very difficult or impossible to treat them afterwards.
Our second area of clash is about how it's bad for society.
We think that what homeopathy does is prays on those who are least educated and on those who are poorest.
Like most people know that homeopathy doesn't work and only those who don't have access to the research are likely to use it or those who are really in situations where they cannot economically afford something else and are just praying that it's likely to work and the problem is that they pretend that it's a cheaper alternative to hospital or meds but given that you often end up having to use both this is not true.
It also delegitimizes medicine in that homeopathic practicers spread lies about very real systems that are more likely to help you in order to sell their product.
It makes less people trust doctors on net which is bad because you end up with more sickness but less people seeking treatment.
It also causes problems for hospitals and doctors when people come in to having tried homeopathic remedies and require further treatment.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should adopt libertarianism.
So this is a fairly broad model, but we think that first, we're going to explain why exactly we think we should adopt libertarianism and then we're going to explain what that would look like.
So the first thing that's important to recognize is that no one is able to fully consent into the society that they're born into, nor even if they move are they fully able to consent to the society they choose to move into.
The reason for this is that there's no more nebulous area in which people can live outside of government control.
There's no area in which an individual may exist in a full state of freedom.
However, we think that when people are best able to self-actualize and best able to fulfill the things that make them happy, which we think is the ultimate point of human existence is to maximize the utility that one has and to maximize the enjoyment out that they can get out of their short period of time on earth.
So we think that the best way that people are able to do that is to live a life that maximizes their freedom.
The reason for this is that people and agents have a better understanding of what is going to grant them utility, the nebulous government bodies that don't directly interact with them.
So while governments may set standards as to what is safe and what is good and what is bad, people should be the ultimate arbiters of what their life is going to mean.
In large part liberal societies when they regulate individuals, regulate individuals in such a way that it tries to maximize their lifespan and there's this kind of tacit belief that life and longevity of life is ultimately worthwhile but we would contest this.
We would say that life isn't worth living simply because you're alive, simply because you're conscious, but life is worth living because of the experiences you have and given the governments can't dictate or can't properly dictate what experiences I can live that are going to lead to me having the best life, we believe that it is essential that people are given the maximum amount of freedom and libertarianism is a system that allows for people to maximize their freedom.
So what do we think this libertarian system is going to look like?
We would structure laws so that they only exist to maximize personal freedom.
This means people would be given full bodily autonomy over their own actions, a right to personal property, and a right to ownership over what they've earned through their own individual actions, and the reason for this is that we think that full bodily autonomy, the ability to choose essentially what I'm going to do with my body and what I'm going to do with my property is the most basic type of freedom that an individual can have.
When people are able to choose what they're going to put into their body, what they're going to do to their body, how they're going to alter it, and how they're going to use it, this is the most essential expression of freedom and therefore laws should abide by that essential expression of freedom.
We would also only create government structures to maximize freedom.
So we recognize that freedom in an ethereal sense can't be attained without certain structures being met in the first place.
What this means is that you need some sort of requisite training to enter the free market.
So we would provide things like educational systems to ensure that all people can correct for the lottery of birth.
We recognize that lottery of birth is unfair and in many instances restraints freedom in that if we're going to adopt a system of libertarianism, we need to ensure that people can have an equal starting point.
So what we would ensure is that government structures exist to allow for this equal starting point to try and equalize levels of education across the population to equalize levels of health and opportunity amongst those that are youngest, that are most vulnerable, and are most dictated by where they were born in life rather than their own free agency and what they freely chosen to do and after a certain point we would remove the structures that prevent people from acting in certain ways.
The laws that we would have would be ones that only prohibit you from interfering in other people's bodily autonomy and we think these are the laws that make the most common sense.
Laws against stealing other people's property, laws against murder and harming another individual's body, these are the things that when people think of government, when they think of law enforcement and criminal justice, these are the things that people want to prevent and we think that through creating a state of libertarianism, people will be in a state that they are most comfortable with, one in which they are most able to actualize the things that they want to achieve and also one in which the laws are most common sense and most abide by what the people themselves want because libertarianism allows for more freedom and freedom ultimately allows for more utility, we believe that we should adopt libertarianism."
"We should subsidize women in science.
Science depends on a diverse group of individuals investigating interesting and important phenomena around the world.
When we systematically oppress and remove an entire section of our society at least half of our society from science all that we do is make everyone's life worse off.
By subsidizing women in science, we will substantially improve our society while also undoing systematic injustices which have been entrenched for far too on.
With that in mind, I propose the following model: that women who are getting STEM degrees will have their degrees subsidized.
That is to say they will pay ten percent less than men for the same degrees after taking all other considerations into account.
So someone who's making only forty thousand dollars a year with a similar GPA as a man applying to the same school will pay ten percent less.
Additionally, anyone any women who works in a STEM field will pay lower taxes, about five percent less than men for the same jobs.
I have two arguments for why this will improve our society and generally be a moral good.
First off is about justice.
There are reparations that are necessary to guarantee that women have their past injustices undone and to ensure that the future of women in tech and science is improved and insured.
First let's talk about past injustices.
Throughout history women have been systematically disenfranchised.
Their ability to get educations, particularly in science, has been incredibly difficult.
Each time that they tried to apply to a particular job but they were told that their position in a job or in their university was taking that same spot away from a man and that in doing so they are being a bad person.
We have an obligation to undo these past harms by ensuring that women get a stronger role in the science fields.
Additionally, we must ensure that equality is performed.
We believe that equality of beginnings is the most important thing but many women start at a place that is worse than men in a variety of positions.
The reason why this is the case is because throughout elementary and middle school even high school women are told that because they're women they should not be pursuing things like math.
By subsidizing women's access to science, we will guarantee that they get a stronger role in all scientific fields.
Additionally, by having this sort of system we improve the future justice of STEM fields as well.
First we're going to see less harassment in the workplace as women have can act in solidarity as women start to get into more managerial roles as things like jokes about women jokes that are problematic are called out more often the entire field will be reformed and be a more safe place for all people.
Additionally we think they will be less discrimination women currently face discrimination while applying for jobs as they move into more hiring manager jobs for science fields this will start to dissipate.
My second argument is about the value of diversity.
We believe that as they're a more diverse workforce comes to power there'll be more ideas proposed.
Women generally have different lived experiences than men and appreciate things differently based on the societal conditions of their upbringing.
This means that they have different ideas that they can bring to the system.
This means that they have different things that they focus on or view that men simply look over or see as unimportant.
Generally we believe that more ideas, more ways to investigate a an issue is more likely to produce a better product and as a result as women start to join these fields we'll get better products which will increase our efficiency and our happy our happiness overall.
Additionally we believe diversity in the workplace is good because when women have cohorts when they have people that they can depend upon it when they have certain issues that men simply can't understand or are unwilling to understand they'll be able to find solidarity and happiness in other women in tech having idols having friends in your field is generally a good thing and a happier employee is a more efficient employee is and a more efficient employee in science makes the entire world a better place.
For this reason we should subsidize women in science."
"We should abolish juvenile courts.
On our side of the house, we think that young people should, first of all, probably not be in the criminal justice system.
There are probably better ways to help children who are being put through this process but that when it's absolutely necessary to put someone through the criminal justice system, everyone should face the same justice regardless of their age.
With that in mind, we have two main arguments for our side.
The first is that these juvenile courts don't actually protect the young people they're created to help.
We think that the best argument the other side of this debate could make is that juvenile courts exist to protect people who are under eighteen from the existing courts, but I think there's a few problems with that idea.
First of all, what do they need to be protected from exactly?
If the courts are actually free and fair, then there shouldn't be any bias against these people just because they're children.
We think that if the justice system is so broken that there's no way to get fair trials for people who are twelve or thirteen, then there's a larger problem that needs to be solved rather than just putting our heads in the sand like an ostrich and just segregating them into a whole nother system.
We think, rather, that these juvenile courts are probably actually harsher on minors than the open courts would be.
Here's why: if you're a judge who deals with , say, mostly fourteen, fifteen, sixteen-year-olds who are accused of crimes day in and day out, you're probably much less likely to be sympathetic to those cases because they're all you see, whereas a judge who sees people from every walk of life and every background is probably much more likely to be sympathetic to the relatively rare child that they see come before them, be more likely to recommend that juries are lenient, be more likely to consider what that child needs.
Because if something's unusual, it's much more likely to capture your attention and get the important type of treatment that it needs rather than something that you do day in and day out.
So I think that, ultimately, these courts don't serve to protect youth.
They serve to commodify them and have them all treated as one group, who actually don't all have the same needs.
It acts as though all young people are the same when that really isn't true, and I think that the differences could be better served in general courts.
And our second argument is that it's unfair to segregate a certain populace of people from the courts.
At the end of the day, everyone in a country has the same right to justice.
We think that justice is the same regardless of how old you are, justice is the same regardless of your background and where you come from.
And this is one reason why principles like habeas corpus, the right to see your accuser and hear the charge against you, exist: in order to provide equality for people who didn't have that right beforehand.
But when you segregate children out into separate courts, you usually have different procedures, different rules, different expectations.
It's true that these things are usually set up under the guise of helping children but at the end of the day, we think that everyone has an equal right to justice and that difference almost always leads to inequality, at least in some sense.
We think that it's very important that the courts treat everyone fairly because if they don't, they lose buy-in from the public.
Courts only work as a conflict resolution technique if people are actually willing to put their faith in them.
If people don't trust courts, then they're more likely to deal with problems on their own or to seek alternative ways to resolve their issues.
So we think that if people think that the courts are much too lenient on children or much too harsh on children, that they're much more likely to seek other ways to solve their problems and that this undermines the authority of the court.
That's why this inequality is such a concern.
But aside from that, it's also a concern because either you're putting innocent people in jail at a higher rate than normal courts, which is unacceptable, or you're letting too many guilty people go, which is unfair to victims.
We think that any deviation from the norm hurts at least one party and, therefore, that this is unacceptable.
Thank you."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition in the motion that boarding schools should be abolished.
Three independent points.
The first is that boarding school represents a decreased family connection that the child has, you know, with their family.
I think this is pretty intuitive as to why this is true certainly, you know, you spend a lot of your time in a boarding school, isolated away from your family.
Even if it's one of the boarding schools where you get to, you know, come back on weekends, this is still a pretty significant amount of time that you're spending away from the people that are supposed to be most invested in your success and in your happiness and your well-being.
When the, you know, boarding school professors and what not, when they become your caretakers, that it seems inherently problematic, because these aren't people that, you know, are your family.
These aren't people whose top priority is your safety and well-being.
There's a certain value in having that familial structure that for your parents their top priority will always be you.
When you're so young and so vulnerable, it's important to have someone that invested in your safety, and when you're not as connected to that group of people, when you're, you know, physically separated from them and emotionally to an extent as well, that represents a serious problem in the development of the child in ensuring that they will be able to, you know, go on at lead a happy life, because they had that protection when they were younger and when they had that emotional support when they were younger.
Our second independent point is that boarding schools increase the likelihood of abuse of children.
So this is both from a physical and from a sexual perspective.
Reporting of either of these issues is really, really rare in boarding schools and that's led to, in recent years, a spike in allegations and in , you know, verified allegations of abuse in these schools.
The reason why this is so rampant is actually quite comparable to why it happened in the catholic church for so long, that there are structural barriers to reporting these instances.
For one thing, these are children, but that's non-unique to boarding schools.
What makes boarding schools so much worse is the fact that you are physically isolated not just from your parents, but also from institutions designed to protect you, like child protection services or the police.
When you're living in close quarters, like literally living with your abuser, it's much easier for the abuser to exert power and influence over the victim in such a way that prevents them from seeking help.
This is what's really problematic about boarding schools then is that it's not something where, you know, you can just go in and institute a couple reforms.
This is structurally intrinsic to the nature of a boarding school, that because you are physically isolated from the rest of the world, that is, by design, the whole point of a boarding school, you are much, much less likely to report abuse, and we think that therefore a ban is justified because so many people are put in harm's way by this structural component.
Our third independent point is just sort of a contact theory lens.
Boarding schools are expensive.
They, you know, disproportionately house extremely rich students, and the isolation that is intrinsic to a boarding school really separates them physically from the rest of the world.
We think it's a problem then when, you know, rich children grow up in environments where they don't really come into contact with people of different social classes.
These schools are also disproportionately white, and we think it is equally problematic when white children that are very rich don't ever come into contact with, you know, minorities, or poorest people.
This is a problem because it allows them to shape a world view that is exclusionary of these individuals, because they never grew up with the sort of humanizing aspect of personally knowing someone from a different social class.
They never come to understand the fact that there is, you know, actual equality between individuals.
Classist attitudes and racist attitudes ferment much, much more easily in environments where you're never forced actually, you know, come into contact with someone that is different from you.
Proud to propose."
"We should ban male infant circumcision.
So the practice is probably familiar enough, it's when the foreskin is removed from a male baby.
This is extremely common in many cultures such as judaism, islam and certain branches of christianity.
It's also commonly practiced even in secular hospitals in the united states and some other countries.
So we have three arguments for why we think this practice should be banned.
And I'd like to point out that we're only talking about infants here, not people who later convert to judaism or other religions.
So first of all, we think that there's a gross rights violation in allowing parents to circumcise their children.
The other team is very likely going to get up here and say that we ought defer to parents in the same way that we let them make decisions about their children's education or other important parts of their life.
But recognize that most countries around the world don't let children get tattoos.
In fact, many countries in europe don't even let you pierce your children's ears until they're of a certain age.
We don't see why something equally permanent and much more potentially damaging to their psyche and future happiness should be permitted while those things are banned.
We think that it's absurd to say that there's a religious rights claim when babies presumably don't practice any religion.
In the same way that we don't allow other forms of harmful body modification, because they violate the right of the child in the future, we think the same is true of circumcision.
The other team might try to tell you that circumcision is harmless and that babies don't remember it, but first response, it is still tremendously painful, we see that babies cry and have to go through post operation treatment after this, but secondly it reduces sexual function later in life, so we think it's a decision that should be left up to individuals rather than one made for them by their parents.
Our second argument is that we don't think that doctors ought be able to participate in this.
To implications of this: so the warrant for why we think doctor shouldn't be able to do this is that they swear a hippocratic oath to do no harm, and clearly removing healthy tissue from a newborn baby is doing some harm.
So what are the two worlds look like?
Either you have doctors perform the operation, in which case they are violating their oath and we think ultimately not acting in good faith when they swear that oath, or you of non medical practitioners doing this, as is common in some orthodox jewish communities.
These people are untrained and often unprepared to perform a delicate surgery.
We think there's a greater risk of damage to the child's body and that ultimately that's unacceptable.
Even if the risk is fairly low, we shouldn't be taking on that risk for children.
Our third and final argument is that this forces religious norms onto people at birth.
So we tell you that while it may be true that someone's parents practice religion that believes this is a good thing, there's no guarantee that the child will follow that religion.
For instance, if your parents are jewish or muslim there's no guarantee that you will grow up to practice those religions.
Perhaps you'll convert to another religion that doesn't require circumcision or perhaps you won't practice the religion at all.
We think that in effect circumcision is an attempt to lock a child and to a certain religious practice and world view from an early age through body modification.
We think that this limits the ability of that child to access other world views, because they've already had their body modified in this way.
Subconsciously, we think it's quite likely that when they grow up and learn about this, that that's likely to influence their views in a way that is beyond their own control.
We think that people in liberal societies ought to have the freedom to determine what religious beliefs are right for them, what is ultimately in their own best interest and that circumcision denies them this ability, not only by changing their physical body but also quite likely the way that the interact with other people and the way that they think about the world.
At that point we think that it's clear that it ought be banned because it's a rights violation for these children on multiple fronts.
So for these reasons we should ban circumcision for infant males.
Thank you."
"The one child policy brought more good than harm to china, because it was an act of necessity, and while it may not have been a perfect policy, it was necessary from a like a physical carrying capacity standpoint, an environmental and an economic standpoint.
So, I think that it's very important to note this necessity, because this necessity came out of the fact, that when it was instituted, china was already the biggest population in the world, with over well over a billion people living with its borders, and this creates a lot of problems.
First, on the like environmental physical like limitation of a carrying capacity of any given area.
Because, it's important to note that, human beings use a tremendous amount of resources in their lives.
That's why we have a lot of like environmental problems, that we have now.
Because human beings use a lot of natural resources, whether it's like oil or coal or gas or whatever for heating, whether it's water for drinking, land for food, or like a land for farming and for food, or precious metals for trinkets that they may like to have, or for like electronics I guess as well, like there's like endless ways in which human beings use tremendous amount of resources.
This is compounded by the fact that as societies go through the stages of development, as they move on from developing countries to developed countries, you only tend to see people using more and more resources.
So, this presents a problem, because china was already one of the biggest countries in the world, and it was already using up a tremendous amount of resources.
China was only going to keep using more and more resources as it got more and more developed as a nation, because its standards of living would just get higher.
So, this is a problem, because it would be it would be just like, without major changes, impossible for china to actually function that way.
You would see mass shortages of a lot of resources, mass increases in the expenses of these resources, because there be such high demands, and a lot of these things have finite like, natural, like a lot of these resources have finite natural capacities, so the supply wouldn't be able to meet the demand that an average human has.
So, this is why a one child policy is important, because it necessarily eh it shrinks you, it shrinks the size of the country in the long run, and it shrinks the demand and strain on these resource in the long run.
I also think this is good from a health standpoint, because overpopulation , especially given that a lot of the population increase in china have been on a lot of like coastal cities in china, which are many of the biggest cities in the world, this is where a lot of the population increase caprice, and there's a lot of density related problems that are health related problems, with overcrowding as well.
But the final thing I want to talk about is about the economic aspects of this, because I think that this was economically important as well, recognize, that by having a ever increasing population is good, as long as the economy keeps growing up, with it.
One of the worst things that you could have is you can be having an influx of people, in their twenties or thirties, not being able to find jobs, because there's been massive increases in the population, but there is economic slowdowns or stagnations.
And, this kind of thing is more evident in a lot of more developed countries, like you can look to places like japan as examples, but also obviously places like america or western europe as well, where as places become more and more developed, you tend to see economies tend to slow down more.
They still grow, but not as much, and this is key, because this meant that if you solve the current rate and of population growth in china continue, at the rate that it was, there simply would not have been enough jobs in order to actually maintain all these kinds of things.
And, this is a important, because like when this policy was enacted in like the nineteen seventies, where you can see right now china's economic growth is already slowing down, like when this was enacted you'd start to see people start to see more and more people, if it weren't enacted in their twenties or thirties, right now who would be struggling to find jobs , this creates demographic problems, it creates long term economic problems, because the worst time to have unemployment is in your twenties and thirties, that's when you're supposed to be getting out of college, starting your career and all those things.
This leads to a whole lot of civil unrest and long term social problems.
So, for all those reasons, the one child policy brought more good than harm."
"We should not subsidize single parents.
Recognize that instead we would prefer to subsidize based on class poverty level not on parental status which we think is the keynote here because whatever money we would be allocating to serve single parents we think should more specifically be siphoned off to people who are of lower class or economically struggling.
If a single parent is poor then that's covered.
The burden is on op to show why single parents need even more than just consideration based on their class.
We think that rich single parents exist in the status quo and they wouldn't be ones that we think need assistance or need subsidization but would still classify under op's model in which you are just subsidizing based on whether or not you are a single parent.
Two main areas of clash, first on why it is an unjustified trade off of resources.
We think that the US has it's not a we think this is a fact the united states has an incredibly welfare budget.
There's always a question of prioritization because the funds trade off regardless of where you put it and those funds didn't really exist in the first place as shown by the fact that nearly every category of welfare is underfunded in the status quo whether it's our orphan care system or our care for homelessness.
So we think that it's more important to subsidize the poor because there's more immediate harm.
If I cannot afford food, if I can't afford a house, if I do not have a job, then the services that can provide you with those things create long term stability but if I'm not provided wih those things that is a risk of mortality in that not having a house in the middle of the winter means that I freeze.
Not having food over long periods of time means that I starve or am more susceptible to disease.
We think these things are always going to be more important because they are always higher order necessities than simply if I am a single parent who already has a house and is able to send their child to school and has a job but maybe this extra subsidization provides me with marginally more of each of those things and we just don't think that that is something that is comparative at all.
We think that when you put money into that general category of single parent those people who need more forego those higher order needs and we think that's incredibly problematic and shouldn't happen but our secondary of cautious about conservative backlash.
Recognize that although it is an incorrect way of thinking people see single parents as having put themselves in their situation.
So this reasoning also applies to when people blame teenage mothers for their situation.
They say you're the one who chose to have sex, you chose to get pregnant, you chose not to make your marriage last or you chose not to be someone who found another like partner, and therefore all of the harms are your own.
This is certainly flawed logic, but it is the logic held by mass by massive portions of the population and especially portions of the population that have a lot of money and a lot of political clout.
So when we do things like we create large amounts of subsidies or help welfare programs for a specific group of people and people get angry about you doing so, it precludes future money or future assistance going to those groups even if we have not fully helped them.
So we think that even if you started to subsidize single parents those who are poorer single parents would still need more help than those who are not as poor but they would not be obtaining it and the problem on their side of the house is that they would never be able to obtain it because of the backlash that would occur that would say look we already gave you something and that should be enough you're the one who created this world.
Bur we also think there's a lot of social backlash in this situation.
We think that oftentimes whether it is rightful or not people tend to take out their political leanings on the people around them.
So if you're someone who is a republican who knows a single mother you are infinitely less likely to include her in things like PTA meetings or talk positively about her to her peers.
You're likely to exclude her from social gathering that might be occurring and these kinds of things over often overflow to the children in question as well.
So if you are the child of a parent who is unhappy about the current state of giving money to single parents, then you're more likely to bully that child because you've probably heard from your parents about how undeserving they are.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should fight gender inequality.
Two main areas of clash, first on inequality as a moral principle.
Recognize that if we win this, it is sufficient to win the round insofar as society is built on the output of moral principles.
We recognize what is right and make these the rules of our society so that we can fight against what oppressive regimes or incorrect individual action.
Without these moral principles we don't have a unified like course upon which to act which means society necessarily becomes disorganized and chaotic and insofar as we need things like laws to function we think this is incredibly important.
So recognize that people are of equal value regardless of their gender.
This is true on two fronts.
First recognize that insofar as we suffer and experience emotion in the same way this makes us of equal value because I question whether I am the brain or the in the same way that my male counterpart does and in the way that I construct myself in the same way that they do.
But also this is sort of physiological like makeup aside from like sex characteristics we have the exact same body makeup, made out of the same material, built in the same ways with the same organs.
Like recognize that even our brain is made in the same way with the same components.
There's no reason that women would be less than men patriarchal and institutional norm that allows men to maintain power and is so created by them.
We think that it would be dumb to say that one worm is different from another worm just because it happens to like have some kind of malformity or like is of like a different gender.
Like if we held two rocks up to each other just because they're different colors doesn't make them inherently different from each other and so in the same way we don't think that there's a grounds to stand upon when we say that women and men might be different.
We also think the lottery of birth is incredibly relative relevant here.
Recognize that gender is arbitrary.
We have a fifty-fifty shot of ending up a man when you're conceived.
Insofar as we wouldn't create public policy around something that is so arbitrary, we don't think that you ought to so when it comes to gender either.
Like recognize that this is exactly why racial discrimination is something that is illegal insofar as these differences are first fake as per the first component of this but second completely arbitrary what kind of race I am born as.
It's not fair that one race gets to impose rules against the other if they are exactly the same and have the same chance of being the same.
But the third let's talk about the veil of ignorance.
Recognize that we ought be treated in the way we would have wanted to be treated by others.
Like recognize that from behind the veil of ignorance if I don't know whether I'm going to end up being a man or a woman I probably want to be treated the same way in both worlds.
Insofar as this is something that stands, we don't think there is a world in which can claim morally that men and women are different.
But even if you think the moral principle isn't enough maybe you complete consequentialist and you don't care we think societally this is also something that is preferable.
Recognize first that it is good when fifty percent of the population is not disenfranchised and that when it is good when they are working at max capacity.
Recognize this is good for certain economic level.
We saw during world war two when women are finally called out of the kitchens in order to work in factories that there was a massive economic boom because you're finally allowing tons and tons of potential laborers to be exploited in the market.
We think this is really good insofar it means more productivity and more fields that are necessarily going to open to meet that need.
So we actually think that like economically and in terms of output, it's really beneficial.
But also I want to talk about innovation because recognize that people inherently think differently from each other and it's inherently good to have diversity in fields.
This has been both scientifically proven but also proven through computer simulation where we recognize that people who come from the same background are going to approach problems in the exact same manner and therefore when they get into some kind of road block they're infinitely less likely to ever find a way to get around it or to get past it.
So we actually think that you make society a lot better and less rights violative when you allow women to when you fight gender inequality.
These reasons proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should introduce recall elections.
A little bit of modeling: what we mean by this is that in the united states we would have a petition.
Once it reaches the appropriate barrier of signatures and congress agrees that there ought be a recall election, then you would go and recast a vote for any elected position.
We aren't limiting this to president or governors or anything like this so anyone, congress people, like local government, etcetera.
Three main areas of clash: first, on why it prevents political abuses.
Sometimes, awful people make it into office because a lot they manage to convince a lot of people in a short amount of time that they happen to not be awful.
A really good example of this is donald trump.
Even the majority of voters of his voters would currently agree that he is an awful choice for president and ought no longer occupy that position.
However, because he managed to be approachable and looked like a good businessman or any number of other justifications that people used for him when they voted for him, he managed to get himself elected, and now there's nothing we can do except impeach him, which is a much more difficult process than getting enough signatures on a petition.
We think that we should be able to have that should we have recall elections, we could prevent him from doing anything worse from now on.
We could have booted him out of office back when he threatened north korea, and therefore we would have had some kind of check on this process, that if someone wears a false face through the entirety of the electoral process, just they can't just take it off once they are elected and expect everything to be okay.
We also think it provides a clearer picture of what being in office look like.
We think that especially in local governments, you have a lot of people who come in because they want to have some kind of perverse incentive, right?
They like want they were they are being paid off by oil corporations, or they want to be more easily like networked with people who might be able to invest in their own company, things like this.
And we think that when you show that there is accountability, they're less likely to do so.
This brings us to our second area of clash, which is basically that it forces politicians to listen to the people, because our current system means that, in the end, all that matters is that moment before elections when they have to convince the populace to vote them into office in the first place.
Our system makes approval ratings matter, because if politicians don't listen to constituents, on our side of the house, then they are going to have a recall election.
And it forces them to not just have to spume like make sure that they make keep the people who are paying them happy, they actually have to keep the general populace that elected them in the first place happy, because these are the people who can sign the petition that gets them recalled.
We think it's especially important for those who don't have reelections to worry about, because we think with a lot of congress people, they have to keep listening to their constituency consistently because they have infinite election cycles to win before them.
But when we're talking about things like president or other elections where there's like a limited number of terms or you don't have to you don't have to you can't run again after your first term, we think that recall the threat of recall elections forces them to still listen to their constituency after they are past the point of no return, even when they aren't afraid of not getting reelected.
We think that currently there doesn't exist a check during that time, and we need to have one.
Our third area of clash is that it encourages political involvement.
It's easy to feel helpless in today's political system when someone you didn't vote for is in office doing awful things that you cannot control.
And in order to cope with those feelings, people tend to disconnect from politics and media to avoid that helplessness.
But if there's hope for a recall, we think that people are much more likely to stay active.
They're much more likely to want to keep up on political events, to be that person checking the president.
They're much more likely to gather signatures or go and fact check things when they don't feel as helpless and they think that there's some point of recourse for them.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should subsidize women in science.
Mean by this is that we would take money from the government and put it into scholarships for women who are pursuing STEM degrees and we would like create what we put money into women specific programs like maybe fellowships that encourage large female joining and like camaraderie.
With that three main areas of clash, first on reparations and we think that we can justify this both on a principle and pragmatic level.
First on the principle in that women have been shunned from STEM fields unfairly for decades due to sexism.
The skew has gotten so bad to the point that we have that like we're without an incentive for for women to enter these programs there isn't going to be a self self correction because they've become self propagating in their isolating this.
Like we think that it's really difficult for a woman to put herself in a situation where she's likely to be the only woman in the room for days and days and days on end and so it's really likely that she never does it in the first place in this constantly is a cycle that propagates itself because other women also don't want to put themselves in situations where they know that they're not going to have other women around them and they're more likely to get sexually assaulted and less likely to get believed when they come out about it.
So we think the only time in which you actually get them in is when you encourage women to go in given that like the situation has become inhospitable they have to have an extra incentive to do it in the first place.
Women are also owed this because STEM is seen as he specifically lucrative stable and fulfilling field yet people who might have been amazing scientists or like very personally fulfilled by this job never got the initial access to this field in the first place and this is indicates a harm done unto them that needs to be fixed and we think that this is like one of the ways in which we do so.
We also think that we have like a precedent for these kinds of programs.
We think like this is why we have things like affirmative action because we recognize that a group has been structurally disadvantaged for years on end to the point where it's very difficult for them to lift themselves out of that situation and so we help them out.
Our second area of clash is about shifting cultural norms.
Recognize that STEM is well known for being male dominant nominated full of sexual assault and generally unsafe for women.
The only solution is to put more women in because they will have an incentive to advocate for their own safety and for other women safety.
Strength in numbers means support for the women who are already there and it's harder for men to get away with shitty shit when you have women who are willing to say this is what he did and women who are willing to support those women because it's really difficult to be a survivor who comes out on their own and knows that they have no support network that knows they're unlikely to be believed and and they get judged by a primarily male like dominated area and so given that something that is so difficult we think that it's really important that you have other women there and there would be able to say like look we've had similar experiences or we believe in your experience.
It's also true that many men genuinely believe that women aren't smart enough or capable of being in these kind of STEM field and we think it's important to demonstrate that there is an institutional issue not a problem with women as a gender and we think that only happens when you put women into that institution and give them the tools they need to succeed through the education system.
Our tlhird area of clash is about why diversity as like is a like inherent good for industry.
Recognize that people from from the same backgrounds and have the same identity tend to think in the same way ie they're less efficient at problem solving as a group because they all have the same way of approaching that problem and this also means that they're just more likely to get stuck because when everybody has the same way of thinking you're also going to have the same way of getting caught on a specific problem.
We think that women provide different experiences and ways of thinking which is always positive in these kinds of fields where innovation and like constant like conferal and like pauses are so dangerous and all of this is really very important things are high speed and up to date and we think that happens when you increase diversity.
Proud to propose."
"We should abandon coal mining because coal mining is incredibly destructive to the environment and that's very very bad.
So let's start by talking about how coal mining is destructive to the environment because I think that it manifests in two ways.
So the first is the way in which the extraction itself happens.
When you're mining for coal the way that it works is you take a mountain or you dig underground, you drill, you take in all of these chemicals, you disrupt all the local wildlife, you literally rip like the like rocks out from the like ground itself, you pollute the environment with like the trucks that come out sometimes depending on like the way in which you're extracting you could be like clearing an entire mountain like destroying it and everything that lives there.
So by and large, the extraction process itself tends to be pretty destructive.
Beyond the extraction process being pretty destructive, there's also the way in which coal is used itself.
Obviously coal is used by burning coal and when you burn coal you see that like you look at coal and you see that it's like incredibly incredibly dirty.
So that's why like when you think of your stereotypical image of a coal miner it's that person with like the dirt and grit all over them after they like went underground into the tunnels.
All of that soot, that dirt, and the grit and all those kinds of things, when you burn coal to get that energy all of that is going back into the atmosphere and that has incredibly profound consequences.
So on the most basic level even before you get into anything about climate change, you're just putting harmful chemicals into the atmosphere.
Most people like being able to breathe the air that they walk in without having to risk like some kind of like asthma attack or developing lung cancer, something like that.
But if you're like in a lot of if you're in an area where there's like coal burning happening nearby it's a lot of harmful chemicals that get released and harmful things that are going into the air can now end up in your body and that's really really bad.
But besides all that, there's obviously a huge impact that coal mining has on the environment because when coal is burned it releases a ton of COTwo into the atmosphere which contributes to climate change in really significant ways.
The ways that it can impact is like by starters like the earth just warming which results in shifts in the basic habitability of some areas.
So if you live on the coast which most of humanity lives on the coast you're probably not going to live on the coast much longer.
You're going to be living under water because when like ice caps melt, when widespread flooding events happen like like hurricanes or like rain storms or things like that that result and widespread flooding, or just like storm surges from like things like that, all of these things are probably going to result in all of that stuff being destroyed.
So widespread flooding is probably going to be a problem.
Besides that, there's also going to be increased climate variation that is a result of winter that is the result of our global warming.
So you're going to see much more extremes.
You're going to see the hottest summers on record and some of the coldest winters on record.
You're going to see so like in boston we had the longest stretch in history of sub like twenty like sub like single digit weather or whatever around like late december or early january just this past year and a lot of that could possibly be influenced by climate change and then a week later you go from like zero degree weather to like fifty degree weather which is like this huge temperature swing and these things happen because you get more extremes.
Or likewise like large parts of the middle east may become uninhabitable because the temperature is going to become even more extreme during the hottest times of the year to the point where it's not even livable.
Obviously food not even getting started on food which isn't really going to be able to be grown if all those things happen.
So obviously, coal mining has a whole slew of problems.
So for all those reasons, we should abandon coal mining."
"We should introduce covenant marriage.
So covenant marriage is a legal category of marriage which is available in three states in america.
Basically it requires that the people who are engaged obtain some sort of premarital counseling and that as a result of this after they get married it will be more difficult for them to seek divorce for instance, they might be required to live apart for a certain amount of time or otherwise face higher legal barriers to divorce than other people would but I'd like to point out the divorce is not impossible after receiving a covenant marriage only relatively difficult.
Very few people have taken advantage of this in america even though it's been around for a couple of decades.
So now that we have some groundwork for the debate, I'd like to advance a couple of arguments for why we should introduce covenant marriage.
First, we think that people deserve to have as many options as possible about how they want to define their marriage and their relationship to the state.
There are two parts of any marriage.
First of all, you have the relationship between two individuals.
Obviously people should have the maximum amount of freedom possible when creating a relationship with another person.
We think that people have a right to self-actualize that this is implicit in the laws of many countries that give people the ability to speak, to live, to do what they want and that ultimately, because of this, we should extend a lot of freedom to people in terms of establishing relationships with others.
But marriage is also a legal contract.
So this also involves one's relationship with the state.
We think that again, people should have the maximum amount of freedom to define their relationship with the state.
If existing forms of marriage don't offer what you want to receive from your relationship with the state of which you are a citizen then we think that whenever reasonable, the government should try to accommodate you for instance, by introducing things like civil partnerships for gay people.
We think that covenant marriages fill a similar role for certain religious communities who want to have more barriers in place to divorce because they think it's unethical.
Ultimately there's very little harm to offering people the ability to have a covenant marriage.
No one's being forced to take it after all.
If people want to get a traditional marriage they still can and we've seen in the US states that have adopted it, that many people do but on top of that, divorce is also not impossible in these covenant marriages.
So it's not like it's fundamentally a different type of relationship with the state than any other type of marriage, it's just one in which it's more difficult to nullify the contract.
With this in mind, we think that there are very few drawbacks to introducing this policy.
It clearly has a benefit to some group of people even if most people won't take advantage of it and it doesn't actually harm anyone.
Everyone who participates is freely consenting into it and ultimately the contract is consistent with other principles.
With that in mind, I think it's clear that we should introduce covenant marriage.
But aside from that, we tell you that it's very likely that people are doing something similar to this whether or not the state condones it.
At that point we think it's better to regulate the practice rather than just ignore it.
What do I mean by this?
Religious communities already put barriers in place for their members to get divorced.
They might require that people meet with a priest or a counselor before pursuing a divorce for instance.
For members of these communities even though there is no civil or secular law preventing them from getting a divorce, these religious regulations may as well have the force of law.
We can see this is true because people hold very deep and serious religious beliefs which tell them that divorce might be unethical, or that they need to respect the words of a religious elder.
So with that in mind, it's likely that people are already facing barriers to divorce.
We think that by introducing this to the legal sphere you can do things like limit the potential for abuse for instance, facilitate people getting a divorce if there's been spousal abuse in an instance when their religious community might not be as supportive.
So with these ideas in mind, we should introduce covenant marriage.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that atheism is the only way.
Two main areas of argumentation, the first on the existence of god and why there is no reason to think that they exist.
First into this is that there is no evidence for the existence of god.
This is true because we are able to determine metaphysical truths about our universe using empirical evidence.
Therefore, the scientific method is the only valid way to prove assertions.
This means formulating theses, developing testable predictions, gathering data to confirm or deny that theses, and then repeating the process a statistically valid number of times.
By using the scientific method, we can acquire or can acknowledge that is true or at least the most likely answer.
Unfortunately, there simply exists no empirical evidence for the existence of god.
Everything in the universe can be explained through rational, natural processes.
It's easy to imagine in ancient civilization looking at a thunderstorm, in the absence of knowledge about the atmosphere and weather, and believing that they must have done something to anger the sky.
But luckily, we live in an enlightened age.
We can explain almost all important phenomena on earth.
In fact, the empirical knowledge we have actually contradicts most of the anecdotal accounts available from most faiths.
We know the bible, for instance, is wrong about the age of the earth, the creation of the world's many creatures, and numerous other things.
But why is this all important?
We tell you that if there is no evidence in support of a position, you should not believe it.
The existence of a "" three o "" god is as likely as any other unsupported fact, I.
_e.
, you might as well believe in a flying spaghetti monster or that aliens run the US government.
But more so, how should you decide on what to believe in?
Our third subpoint is that people should follow occam's razor, a problem-solving mechanism which states, "" among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assertions should be selected. ""
Why is occam's razor a good measure?
Essentially, without it, any set of facts can have infinitely many explanations getting infinitely complex like, if there's a god who's to say there aren't eight gods, four of whom work night shifts, one does stuff on thursdays, and all are protrusions of the gem of some alien being.
We see this all the time with conspiracy theorists.
Someone who wants to believe nine-eleven was an inside job avoids ever being proved wrong by using what we call ad hoc hypotheses, I.
_e clearly the government tampered with the footage because it was an inside job, and clearly eyewitnesses were bribed because it was an inside job.
Settling the simplest explanation is the only way to cut off change of argument before they become absurd.
The impact here is obvious.
The impacts the existence of god relies on many more assumptions that competing explanations, which rest on natural phenomena that are empirically proven, therefore, you must default to our natural, not supernatural explanation.
Our second point is about the dangers of irrationality.
We want talk to you about reason and faith.
We think most religious people accept that they cannot prove the existence of god, but rather think faith is supposed to exist independently.
This makes faith definitionally irrational.
Here's why holding irrational beliefs is bad: we would posit that a belief in god, because it rejects reason, is, firstly, a priori bad.
What does this mean?
Namely, turning one's back on reason is intrinsically not good.
Recognize that reason and logic are guiding universal principles.
Logic always works, just like two plus two equals four is always true.
The problem for the other side of the house is that if god's existence is not logical, faith is simply that flies in the is simply something that flies in the face of the basic principle of how humans should interpret and understand ideas.
Secondly, we would say that making an exception in this case enables people to make more exceptions.
What does this mean?
Religion is intrinsically irrational, but also a belief system in which there are generally commandments, figures of authority, and a reward system in the afterlife.
Furthermore, god is the source of all good and their world is law.
This is bad for two reasons.
One, because the system enforces certain norms that may be harmful, for example, women being forced to be subservient to men.
Do to not do these arbitrary things is sinful and punished, which we think strips human of their agency.
Two, because god becomes infinite justifications for doing pretty much anything.
The fact that so much of the violence in our world is a result of religion, from the crusades to nine-eleven, we can see that religion becomes a justification for violence.
It is because of this that when you do not use reason, you allow yourself to become the extreme."
"We should fight the BDS movement.
So BDS, boycott divest and sanctions, is an international movement that wants to basically attack israel for their treatment of the palestinians in a way comparable to what the international community did to force an end to apartheid in south africa.
So I think that what this debate really comes down to is whether BDS is an effective movement that ought be continued.
A couple of arguments on our side: the first is that BDS won't actually help the palestinians.
There are a few reasons why this is true.
The first is that BDS actually has entrenched support for israel in the united states.
Because of the configuration of the international community right now, as long as israel has the US as a staunch ally, it doesn't matter if two hundred other countries oppose them.
They're going to be completely fine.
They'll still be integrated into the global economy, and no one will be able to touch them militarily.
And that's just not going to change because of BDS.
If anything, the narrative that BDS has created is that israel is under siege like they were during the sixties and early seventies, rather than that israel is a really powerful country that actually is able to impose its will on its neighbors and the palestinians, which is probably more true today.
Especially for older american conservatives, BDS just sounds like the same kind of rhetoric that was used by people who hated israel and wanted to kill all the jews in the sixties.
So essentially, it's only entrenching american support by people who probably mean well but don't understand how the situation has changed in the last forty to fifty years.
Therefore, we don't think that there's a clear path for BDS to help the palestinians.
And since the purpose of this movement is to end the mistreatment of palestinians by the israeli government, to help them get sovereignty, and to help them be treated as equal citizens in israel, and since this movement has no path to doing so, we should obviously fight against it because it's hindering our ability to actually help people.
It's using political capital and making in an inefficient way, and it's making people who support the palestinians look like they're doing things that are inefficient and actually counterproductive.
And our second argument is that the BDS movement has just been really poorly managed and poorly implemented, and has probably done more harm than good because of internal problems, not just external ones.
To give an example of this, BDS is like a hot topic at american universities right now.
But unfortunately, it's not people who are really well-informed about these issues who are leading the BDS movement in america.
It's americans who, frankly, are not jewish or palestinian, so they're not really as connected with the issues as they could be and who don't understand any of the issues on a fundamental level.
So many of the leaders of the student movement for BDS in the US right now, like students for justice in palestine, are frankly idiots who don't understand what they're talking about, and it's so frustrating when you're on a college campus.
My college roommate was israeli and very favorable towards treating the palestinians better obviously, but completely got shut out of any meetings about the topic because people would just say, "" you're an israeli jew, therefore, you're bad, "" which is one reason why a lot of people have said that the BDS movement is anti-semitic.
If you look at its leadership, there are disproportionately few jews considering how many jews in the diaspora and in israel are very invested in helping the palestinians.
And I frankly do think that there's a lot of anti-semitism and anti-semitic narratives in the BDS movement.
So, ultimately, what this has done is that the BDS leadership, because they're incompetent at best, have associated helping the palestinians with hating jews, which couldn't be further from the truth.
These two things shouldn't have anything to do with each other.
Many jews believe it's against jewish values the way that israel's treating the palestinians right now, but the narrative now has gotten so toxic that all jews feel like they have to oppose BDS and oppose palestinians in the diaspora, and ultimately, I think that american jews should be some of the first allies of the palestinians.
So for all of these reasons, because it won't help the palestinians and because it just atrociously poorly run, we should fight the BDS movement.
Thank you."
"The free market should be protected.
By this we mean that government should intervene in order to prevent anti-market behavior from private actors.
We think that for instance, anti-trust laws should be upheld in order to prevent any one actor from gaining a huge monopoly and using it to prevent free exchange and fair contracts and the like.
For instance, we think that bell telephone, which had a phone monopoly in the united states for many decades, actually posed a threat to the free market because they were able to use their monopoly status to prevent any other company from competing in the american telephone market.
We're going to talk about three pillars of what we see as the free market system, and how we ought protect them.
We think that the first pillar that you need to consider is the possibility of fair competition.
The free market relies on the idea that the best company, or the best product, or the best idea will win out over others because people will choose to consume it.
But obviously this is only true if they're able to compete on somewhat equal footings.
Even if I invented a very good toaster oven, if there were a company that had a monopoly on toaster ovens that prevented any store from selling mine, then no one would be able to have better toast as a result of my product.
So that wouldn't really be a free market.
We think therefore, that you need to have things like anti-trust laws that prevent monopolistic behavior.
If for instance one company is very good at making mattresses and they use that to leverage the selling of their toasters by threatening not to sell mattresses unless stores also sell their toaster exclusively, then you don't really have any competition.
Ultimately we need to prevent trust from existing so that people are able to bring new ideas to the market.
One of the great strengths of the free market is that you have innovation and an incentive for people to work hard.
But monopolistic behavior prevents innovation because once you have a monopoly there's no incentive to provide a better product.
We saw this with bell telephone.
American telephony was far behind western europe or other parts of the developed world for many decades because there was no incentive to improve once big bell had their monopoly.
Our second argument is about protecting contracts.
One of the most fundamental parts of the free market system is that contracts are enforceable.
What does this mean?
If I say that I will sell you a certain number of toasters then you can guarantee that I have to do that or that you will be compensated by the courts.
You're able to go to a civil court and ultimately get what you're owed according to a fair freebie signed contract.
But what happens when one party is much more powerful than any other?
Ultimately monopolistic companies, which we argue are likely to emerge without regulation, would be able to enforce unfair contracts.
They would have have so much more bargaining power than anyone with whom they bargained that no one would be able to be sure that contracts would actually be fulfilled.
They would be able to bury people in court to prevent things from ever being heard in court and ultimately prevent contracts from underlying the system.
In doing so you would make it much more difficult to do business and actually undermine the free market.
So we think it's essential that the state intervene in order to ensure that contracts are fair and that they're actually upheld regardless of the power of one of the parties involved.
Our final point is about encouraging exchange.
In order for the free market to succeed people have to think that it's worth their while to invest in the market and ultimately to participate therein.
If there's no way for people to make money because of monopolistic or anti-competitive behavior by certain actors, then ultimately people are going to exchange with each other in other ways outside of the general market.
This will make it more difficult for out groups such as ethnic minorities to participate in free exchange.
So we think it's important that the government encourage people to participate in the market system in order to ensure its long term success and in order to ensure access by all different groups.
For all of these reasons the free market should be protected.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should fight nationalism.
What we mean by this is that we shouldn't be promoting nationalistic ideologies, we should be discouraging people from expressing nationalistic views just in general like we would prefer a world in which we didn't really have nationalism as it currently is.
Two main areas of clash.
The first on domestic harms, and I really want to talk about the way that it changes the way that we treat immigrants and especially how it makes it much worse because when you when your identity is wrapped up in the us versus them mentality it is incredibly unlikely that you're going to treat those who you perceive as them very well at all.
In fact, because because you are so defined by this concept of being one nationality and having to prove that you are better than another and oftentimes using stereotypes and other negative mechanisms to make sure that you are seen as better than the other, you actually end up in a situation where it is guaranteed that you're going to be treating citizens immigrants worse if you are nationalist.
I think a really good example of this exist in the status quo when we see the way the US is treating immigrants coming in either from middle eastern countries or from across the border from mexico.
Because we have such strong patriotic american feelings and we're willing to use rhetoric like stealing our jobs because we have such a possessive kind of way of viewing our country and viewing this land we refuse to cooperate or welcome those who happen to be less fortunate and happened to be born into a different categorization of country.
And so we actually think that this is like already we're seeing the negative impacts of being a nationalist nation as the united states.
We also think that you're much more likely to ascribe these negative stereotypes and see them as invaders if you are more nationalist because necessarily you are identifying people primarily by the nationality and by what country they're coming from and only secondarily maybe you're considering who they are as people or what their priorities are or whether they are starving or suffering and so because of that we actually think that you poison the way that people begin to think about immigrants from the get go.
We also think it's important to notice that domestically it's incredibly difficult to criticize the government if you have a strong nationalist party or a strong nationalist following because basically what that does is when you're the one person saying bad things about the government and everybody else feels very positively then you're seen as an anti-nationalist to do so and it there's much more likely to be backlash or criticism against you.
We also think that you're just less likely to think critically about the government if the environment in which you are raised is one that perpetuates that the nation is great recognize the nationals unnecessarily has to perpetuate the narrative that the nation that you're currently living in is doing well and is successful and is better than others which means that you're actually much less likely to be raised in an environment where you're thought to think critically in the first place.
Our second independent point is about international harm.
Recognize that inherent to the definition of nationalism is thinking that you are better than other countries.
It creates a superiority complex which makes it much more likely that you're going to declaim others and their ideology and that you're less likely to actually want to cooperate or work with other people.
We think this necessarily leads to more militaristic states because if the people who are within those states are more willing to take military action on behalf of the government and more likely to create black and white broad sweeping generalizations about whether a specific ideal ideology that is not of the country they come from is good or bad.
We think a really good example of this is when the united states would invade vietnam or any other countries that we invaded during our little anti-communism trope that we played for a bit and at this time what we saw is because of our strong nationalism, out positive feelings towards capitalism etcetera we were willing to actively take other people's lives and oppress them and throw agent orange on top of their heads in order to prove a point essentially.
We also think that nationalism hinders globalization.
There's necessarily an unwillingness to compromise when you feel like you are objectively correct.
It makes it really hard to run the global economy fairly because it makes it hard it makes hard lines between nations that stop nations from caring about each other and caring about citizens that aren't necessarily their own.
So we think that without nationalism it's just much more likely that the united states or another country would look out for the citizens of a different country.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should ban spanking.
So, we think that the penalty for spanking would be similar to minor forms of child abuse, in which people would have to be overseen by the government, there would be some sort of intervention, to make sure that the child is in a safe and productive home, and that there would be checkups occasionally to ensure that repeated abusive behavior isn't occurring, and of course if spanking escalates, or if it continues in some manner, a child can be taken out of the home, but this wouldn't be the first instance, this wouldn't be done in the first instance, but it would certainly be a penalty eventually.
Given that, we have a model, we think there are two main reasons why we should ban spanking.
The first is that, we don't think parents are the ultimate moral arbiters or have unique parenting knowledge, that make them capable of making these decisions, and secondly that, there are real harms that come from spanking.
So firstly, on parents.
We would say that any individuals can become parents, it doesn't require any sort of specialized knowledge, it doesn't require any capability of actually raising the child, it doesn't require a certain temperament, it just requires getting someone pregnant, and raising the child with that individual, or becoming pregnant yourself of course.
So, given that this is the case, we don't think that parents should be revered as having some sort of special knowledge, or ability to know that their actions will lead to a good end.
We think that, that is a problem in the status quo, that there's an assertion by individuals that parents should have the autonomy to treat their children as they see fit, because they know what is best in their specialized interest, but this simply isn't the case.
Not all parents are experts on what their impacts will be on their children moving forward, not all not all parents are experts in childhood development, and frankly, a lot of parents simply don't know what they're doing, when they have a child.
Given that this is the case, we don't think that parents should have full autonomy to treat these children in a way that, we would never allow them to treat other adults.
We also think that, it's crucial to recognize that, children have no ability to fight back against this.
Children have no power in this relationship, and therefore if there's some sort of abuse that is coming out of this, if the child is receiving too much or an incommensurable amount of harm, based on what they're being punished for, or educated on, or what have you.
We think that there's no way for a child to check on this, and therefore, given that the child is in such an asymmetry of power position, that they're so lacking in this ability to advocate for themselves, that the state should be extra precautious, and ensuring that children will never be spanked or never be harmed disproportionately to what, even people that would favor spanking would say, is fair.
But secondly, there's also real harms that come from spanking.
Recognize that, just because we call it spanking doesn't mean that it's not a form of assault, that it's not the basic nurturer in a child's life striking them, and causing them physical harm.
This can have immense psychological ramifications, including children being unwilling to talk to their parents, when they have certain problems, because they fear being harmed if they say the wrong thing.
It causes emotional closure, that makes it more difficult for children to interact with the world around them, which we think has very dramatic long term harms on their ability to socialize with others.
Furthermore, if one is spanked as a child, or harmed as a child, or assaulted as a child, they're more likely to repeat those actions, because children are socialized, and learn how to act as a parent, from their parents, because that's how they learn what the role of intends.
So we think that, if you don't ban spanking, you're likely to have repeated cycles of violence, in which children, that were spanked and ultimately assaulted by their parents, are more likely to pass on, and extend that behavior on to their children.
So, it's crucial for the government to intervene, especially when it's impacting very impressionable children that are likely to extend that harm in perpetuity, into the future.
Given that, parents have a special obligation to ensure that their child, their children can function in society, to ensure that their children can be fully formed adults, and that they don't grow up to be individuals that are going to cause more harm than good in the lives of others of other people around them.
Spanking fails to meet that standard, it fails to meet what parents are obliged to do by their children, and because of this, we should ban spanking."
"We should criminalize physician-assisted suicide because it is ultimately impossible to check against abuses, and the ways in which it can be abused can ultimately have incredibly pow-profound impacts on disadvantaged people in society.
So, let's break down first, how this is actually going to look, because when you recognize the diseases that people often have when they're contemplating physician-assisted suicide, we're talking about diseases that it's very difficult or impossible to cure or treat, and treatments for these kinds of diseases can oftentimes be incredibly expensive, incredibly difficult, or things like that.
So, here's why this presents a problem.
Because there's a whole lot of people who may not be able to, it could be more like of a financial hardship for them if they're going to be paying for this money.
Now this presents a problem because then they could feel pressured into taking this they could be pressured into opting to die simply because it seems like a more financially feasible option, is a way to opt out of treatment, especially if you're only going to die in a few more months anyway.
I think this is very very bad however because, especially when you're at the end of the life, life is the most sacred thing that you could possibly have.
It's it's the root of everything that you could ever value and the last few months that you live are the most precious months and are months that should never be deprived of you and there however in it's it's it's a time to be so it's essentially it's time to do some of the things you wish you could have done throughout your life and this is your last chance to do them, to say goodbye to people.
It's very important in a lot of ways to make sure that you don't feel pressured into prematurely ending this time, and that I think is a very legitimate fear that can come out of that.
And there's no real way to check against that because it's impossible to really tell or determine if somebody is doing something because they generally feel genuinely feel at peace with a decision they're making or they're doing it because of some other kind of exterior pressure, something that we don't think should be a legitimate grounds for someone choosing to die therefore.
But the next thing I want to talk about is not just coercion because of socioeconomic status but because of the ailment that you may have itself.
You can have especially for a lot of aging people you could have alzheimer's you could possibly have a patient who has some kind of like some form of autism or there are some other kind of way in which the patient isn't able to fully conceptualize the magnitude of the decision that they are making.
This is another very clear set of circumstances where you can't actually consent to what is being done to you, and this is also another tricky set of circumstances because you may wnd up with somebody who says "" oh, well this is fine.
There's no problem with this, this is legal, this is going to be easier, I'm going to die anyway, blah blah blah "".
But the problem is is that if they're not able to have a full cognition of this, then they're ultimately having their life taken away from them without their consent.
Something that is obviously quite bad.
The final thing I want to talk about is about ethics in general because I think that the goal of medical ethics and the goal of medicine in general should not be just to minimize suffering in such a way, to minimize suffering through death or things like that.
I think that that in many ways that's just a wrong way of looking at it, and the way in which you should go about this is minimize suffering while you can live yourself.
So if there is fear that someone is going to spend their last few months in pain, try instead of focusing on ending that pain prematurely, you want to make sure that there's a focus on better and more like new or better ways in which to end suffering.
So for example, instead of giving somebody a cocktail of a billion prescription drugs, maybe let them use medicinal marijuana or alternatives like that that could be nice for chronic pain.
There's I I think in a lot of ways even if it doesn't currently exist, this could also foster more research and development and those kind of things.
So for all those reasons, physician-assisted suicide should be a criminal offense."
"Home birth should be banned.
Home birth is the practice by which a mother chooses to have her child in her own home rather than at a hospital or some other more traditional setting in which to have the child.
So we have a couple of reasons why we think people should not be allowed to choose to give birth in their own home as opposed to in a controlled medical facility.
First, we're going to establish a standard for when the state can limit people's freedom, because obviously if you take away people's right to choose, you are removing a certain amount of their freedom.
But we think that that's okay when people are just making a really bad decision.
So, a standard for paternalism: first, when there is an asymmetry of information, we think that the government should get involved.
Ordinary people are really bad at interpreting medical advice and information because they lack the education to really understand what something actually means for them, and also because people are really bad at interpreting statistics and how they affect themselves.
We think that because the people choosing to have home births basically are not educated enough to make this decision, unless they're some sort of a OBGYN, that effectively we shouldn't permit this for people, because they won't have the information to make a good decision.
But secondly, we would be okay with the state intervening when there is a harm to a third party because of someone's decision.
And it's really clear that allowing home births poses a risk to the child being born, who didn't consent into this.
We think that because there's a comparatively greater risk of the child being harmed at a home birth than in a hospital because there's no doctor on hand, that ultimately we shouldn't permit this.
We're fine with the state limiting one person's freedom when it's in order to protect another person's basic rights, such as the right to be born in a safe, healthy fashion.
So, ultimately, we think that there is clear grounds here for the state to intervene to limit these mothers' freedom.
And our second argument is a little bit more pragmatic and it's about the cost to the healthcare system.
So, in most countries, such as france or britain, when you give birth, huge burden of the cost is placed on the government.
So you go to the hospital and the state pays for this birth.
But because this is so routine, the costs are not astronomical.
They're expensive but much lower than, say, emergency surgery and an ambulance, which is the alternative if you have a home birth that goes horribly wrong.
Even if nine out of ten or even if ninety nine out of one hundred home births go without issue, the extremely high cost of dealing with a medical emergency ultimately you're going to make this too expensive for the state to bear.
In other words, if you had a home birth that began to go wrong and there was hemorrhaging or something like that, and someone had to be brought in an ambulance to the hospital and go to the emergency room, and surgery had to be done to save the mother and the child, you could be looking at costs over a hundred thousand euros compared to just a few thousand euros to deliver a child in a hospital.
Because the state has finite resources to spend on healthcare and because money is fungible, we don't think it's acceptable to allow the risk of such high spending.
In other words, abolishing home birth is insurance for the state that an extremely expensive procedure won't take place.
Because if something goes wrong at a hospital birth, you already have the doctors there.
Everything you need is already in place.
So you don't have to go through the same extremely high cost that you would otherwise.
It's also much less likely that things get to that point, because while small complications might spin out of control in a home birth, if you're already at the hospital with a doctor on hand, it's likely that things can be resolved before they ever get to that point.
So, because of the lack of access to information, because of the risk to the child, and because of the extremely high cost involved, home birth should be banned.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban gambling.
Before I get into my two independent points, I want to first give you a little bit of context for what gambling industry looks like and how it tends to affect individuals because a lot of the time these aren't just scratch-off tickets that your grandmother gets from a grocery store eventhough we're against those as well.
What these look like are large corporate casinos that focus on making more and more money regardless of the impact they have on the individuals there.
They oftentimes employ techniques specifically to try and keep people there for as long as possible and to make their games as attractive as possible, as well as often dousing the people there with copious amounts of liquor to impair their critical thinking ability and to keep them from trying to leave.
I think what this shows you is that a lot of the time these areas are these casinos are incredibly coercive, even going so low as to advertise specifically in lower income areas because they know these people tend to be more susceptible to these kinds of influences.
Meanwhile, gambling is a very real addiction that affects millions.
It bankrupts families and it destroys lives.
In the same way that any kind of drug might be addictive, we think that gambling sets off the same kind of chemical processes and thus ought be treated the same.
With that, two main areas of clash.
First on why the government has a real interest in keeping these in keeping in banning gambling.
Because one of the ways by which we recognize that our government can ban something is by showing that it has a government interest in that subject.
So, in this situation there are two main areas in which the government has an interest.
First with regards to economics.
When people are spending their life savings on gambling, they aren't providing for their families or putting that money back into the economy or in any kind of productive way.
Because these these casinos tend to be very large corporations spending there doesn't actually trickle down locally.
So you're not supporting local businesses, you're not supporting local jobs, rather you're giving to a monolith and the people at the top take the majority of the money while waiters get paid very very little.
More than this though, a lot of the more than this though if you're going to have a gambling addiction you're oftentimes living paycheck to paycheck and your family, if you have one, gets very little or even nil.
This is why we see that a lot of gamblers are also on things like welfare or medicaid or have families who have to rely on public services because they have because their parents who have addictions cannot provide for them.
So at the point that your first not likely to put this money in productive economic ways but second much more likely to rely on governmental funds, we don't think this is economically good for the government to allow banning to allow to allow gambling.
Second though we think it's also bad for the nation when people are addicted to gambling as it impacts productivity.
If large swaths of your population are addicted to gambling, that's a lot of productivity being lost in that instead of being involved in your family or going out and volunteering or doing anything that might be helpful for society or working more hours at your job, you're just waiting to be done so that you can go and gamble that way.
Even if a tiny portion of this time was spent doing something more productive this would already be preferable.
More than this though we also think it creates cycles in which oftentimes people start alcohol dependencies or drug dependencies in casinos and this decreases productivity into the long term.
Our second area of clash has to do with externalities because the other reason a government can ban something is if they can show that there are very large personal and external harms.
The ban and gambling does exactly this given that is heavily addictive in the same way that drugs, such as meth, are harmful not just to the individual but also to their family the gambling is too.
Given that not only is this person broke but it's also incredibly harmful to any children they might have given that all of their money is being spent and they do not get to spend time with this parent.
It also creates cycles of abuse in that the children of gamblers are much more likely to be prone to gambling addiction than those who aren't.
This tears apart families, it destroys careers, and it ought be banned.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should ban free newspapers.
So in this debate, we're talking about newspapers that are distributed free of charge in places like cities, on public transit.
You probably seen these all over the floor of the subway if you ever take that to work.
So, three arguments: the first is about the waste that these free newspapers produce.
Nobody wants these, right?
We see that people might read them, but then they throw them on the ground and you end up with tremendous amounts of paper waste.
People don't place a high value on something that's free to them, so they're less willing to put in the effort to actually hold on to it or to be sure that it gets to a recycling bin.
I think this is the reason why you often see them left on, you know, the seats of buses or on public transit, or you see them on the ground in public places near where they were being distributed in the first place.
So we're totally fine with banning these papers simply to reduce the amount of paper waste that's being thrown out every day.
We think, ultimately, this is a big harm to the environment and that there's no reason to allow these newspapers to basically carpet city streets when they provide very little public benefit.
Our second argument is that these free papers provide poor information to their readers.
Ask yourself: what kind of quality of journalism can you provide when you rely solely on advertisements and don't charge any sort of subscription fee?
We think that it's very unlikely that you can actually hire qualified journalists or for to run good stories.
So there's two options here.
One is that they either run a bunch of associated press or reuters articles, but those cost money so we don't think that's very likely.
Or two, that they run nonsense, which we see happens all the time.
You end up with tabloids that are just full of lies about celebrities.
And we think that there's very little value to allowing these things to be distributed, that they fill people's heads with nonsense and misinformation, that they're a huge source of fake news which leads people to vote in less than optimal ways, and that, ultimately, they don't provide any benefit to society.
So, basically, they're not just litter, they're also garbage for your brain.
Which leads us to our last argument which is that these papers harm other newspapers.
First of all, we tell you that if people think that they can get a newspaper for free, they're not always tremendously discerning, and they're less likely to read things like local papers that cost money, that would give them legitimate and useful information, when they think that they can get these other newspapers for no cost.
People are very rarely going to place a high premium on getting access to good information.
So if we ban free newspapers, we think it's more likely that people will seek out and consume other newspapers once we remove that option from them.
With this in mind, I think it's clear that the harms these newspapers do by competing on a market with paid, good newspapers is a tremendous detriment to society.
It changes how people vote, how they interact with one another.
It reinforces, oftentimes, harmful views.
So we think that clearly we should ban these free newspapers for that reason as well.
The last argument that we'll make for banning these newspapers is maybe you would say: look, despite all those things, these companies should still have the right to freely distribute their product if they want to.
But we think that, ultimately, the harms of these free newspapers fall disproportionately on communities that can't advocate to get rid of them, that the harms of the litter, of the misinformation, of the lack of access to good newspapers, falls most harshly on low-income, inner-city communities.
This is where these papers are most likely to be distributed.
At that point, we think it's clear that there is a disproportionate harm to a disadvantaged community.
So there is a clear legal precedent, at least in the US, britain and many other countries, for banning something that has a disproportionate impact on a community that has relatively little ability to protect themselves from this harm.
So for these reasons, we should ban free newspapers.
Thank you."
"Open primaries are advantageous in the united states because they discourage hyper partisanship and they encourage more civic engagement amongst the population.
Two things that I think are very important: so let's first start by what do we think that the model means?
The what the motion means.
When the motion says that open primaries are advantageous we think that the most obvious interpretation is that there should not be closed primaries.
So states like my home state of florida or other states that practice with closed primaries they should stop doing that.
So let's start by talking about partisanship and why that's bad and why open primaries can help solve this problem.
The reason why partisanship is bad is because you first and foremost obviously get more extreme policy positions, policies that are less likely to be more broadly acceptable to the population and secondarily because even if you don't get more radical policies you're more likely not to get any policies at all because partisanship tends to lead to gridlock which means problems don't get solved, even basic problems like crumbling infrastructure or basic reforms of taxing and things like that.
So why do we think that open primaries help to solve this problem?
Because when party affiliation is required as for like a part of primaries, it means that people aren't going to have to like be as able to engage in primaries.
And this is like very very important because being able to participate in a primary is incredibly important, obviously primaries decide who's going to be able to run for president, so in many ways the scope of what the main national debates are, the scope of the main national elections that scope and that is decided by who is actually going to be involved in the primaries.
So if you're forced to, in order to pick people for president have a party affiliation this means that in a lot of ways in order to in order to actually get involved in that process you're going to have to necessarily become more partisan.
So this essentially limits it so that if you want to have a choice in what the scope of the debate is going to be, if you want to decide like the ideals that are actually going to be able to make it to a national platform, you're required to attach yourself to a party.
So that's like very that's bad.
Open primaries take this problem away because you don't have necessarily have a party registration in order to do that.
But the next thing that I want to talk about is about the scope is about engagement about why we think this is more likely to be helped on our side of the house.
So obviously the united states has a problem with civic engagement.
Voter turnout rates in the united states are oftentimes very low compared to a lot of other developed countries and the reason why I think that this is very likely true well this is a problem obviously because this also means that duh policies are like just less representative, less democratic and less people are having their voices heard.
So why is it but why do open primaries make this more likely?
Make this problem more likely to go away?
Because there's a whole lot of people who are registered as independents or a whole lot of people who maybe have a third party registration or just a whole lot of people in general who don't have some kind of party affiliation.
And all of these people are excluded from the process.
These people aren't able to actually vote.
So for example you could have someone you could have someone who lives in a state like florida, they're registered independent or they're they oftentimes support a third party candidate.
But these people still have preferences as far as who should be running in the primary as far as who they want to win the primary because they are still able to vote in the national election so if they're planning on doing that so in a lot of ways this could just lead to like more discouragement.
If these people aren't voting in primaries or in like mid term election or things like that they're less likely to be invested in the system overall and if these people are less invested in the system overall then they may not be a they they may not be as likely to vote on like general election days either because they're not already more invested in the process.
So for all those reasons open primaries in the US are advantageous."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban anonymous posts.
What we mean by this is that on the internet and forums and other public spheres that allow posting you ought not allow any kind of anonymous groups and any kind of account will have to be linked with the names and emails of individuals.
We understand that this isn't going to catch all of the individuals making like secretive counts insofar as someone can like create like other emails under fake ID's and stuff but we do think this sufficiently reduces the anonymity and makes it a lot easier to track.
With that, three areas of clash.
First on creating accountability.
Recognize that people are their most awful when they knew that they can't face repercussions for their actions.
Anonymity is the ultimate form of freedom because it means that you never have to face the consequences on two levels.
First personally.
Recognize that most people usually feel ashamed or nervous about having socially unacceptable things associated with their name.
There's a stigma within society that they're like certain systems that are socially preferable and certain decisions that are and people outside of their that norm tend not to voice those opinions.
This is why we saw a lot of trump voters who didn't disclose that they were voting for trump and that's why we were so shocked by the polling results because a lot of people just flat out lied due to their shame.
We think that you get a lot more personal freedom to be your worst when you can unlink yourself from your name and therefore from your actions making yourself feel like an innocent party and unashamed.
We also think there's a second lever layer of social repercussions.
The other reason people aren't openly shitty is because they're afraid of social repercussions like getting frozen out of groups having conf and having confrontations.
It's really difficult to socially target someone if they're anonymous because they can just disappear forever and you have no way of contacting them.
You also can't push them off of message boards when accounts can be anonymous and people can post without having accounts so it's really hard to ban users if if not anonymous people have to face these consequences and they're much more likely to spew this nonsense and like problematic thoughts in the first place because they have to check their actions against the fact that other people will be able to recognize and trace who did it.
Our second area of clash is about facilitating discussions.
When you can go anonymous, people are more likely to say really bad things and say things that are completely unproductive, they're more likely to insult users using personal attacks they're more likely to say things that are openly trollsy and racist and shit posty.
This is really bad because what it does is blocks out any real discourse when conversations are flooded by people trolling or people messing around.
So we think that people are much more likely to explain themselves and make actual responses when they know that they can be tracked or blocked so that their actual account is at risk as well as their social relationship.
We think that in that way it fosters a real conversation.
We also think that when you are allowed to systematically block trolls, it reduces the amount of this fluff which makes conversations a lot easier to follow.
We think a lot of what happens on message boards is that even when it starts out as a real conversation someone decides to make fun of them and then there's no way to control that because messaging like because posts are anonymous and anyone can post so we actually think that one of the ways that you reduce that noise and allow individuals to have real conversations is by making sure that you can either hold them accountable or throw them out of it.
Our third area of clash is about tracking.
KKK rallies, plans to vandalize synagogues mosques other hate crimes a lot of this planning and inviting occurs anonymous message boards like oftentimes it's just an anonymous user being like here's a date and time like here's what you need to do like here's the nonsense that we want to get up to join if you like.
Like we think the problem here is that these anonymous posts are impossible to track in terms of police but it's also really hard to track on a personal level.
So first talking about police tracking like if the activity is illegal, it's infinitely easier to track participants when it's associated with a user name and an email and like a real name because it's easy as contacting the website being like here is our warrant then going from there.
The problem with with anonymous boards is that it's infinitely more difficult to track these and infinitely more difficult for police to keep account but we also think that personal tracking is really important if people of color know where racist people are gathering they can more easily plan around that counter protest that or just avoid the situation entirely.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"We believe that marriage is outdated.
So by this we mean that the traditional institution of marriage is no longer that relevant to our society today, and we think that it would be better if people would move away from it.
So we have three arguments for you.
The first is that women's status in society has greatly changed.
If you look at marriage historically, think about in ancient times all the way up to the present, marriage has ultimately been an institution that serves to oppress women.
We see that in ancient roman times for instance, marriage was seen as a transfer of a woman from being her father's property to her husband's property, and this is the notion of marriage that underlies a lot of christian ideas about marriage, that ultimately a woman is the responsibility of her father until she gets a husband.
Obviously today we don't look at things that way.
We've moved away from that, thankfully.
What we think, therefore, is that marriage is ultimately demeaning to women because it forces them to go through this ritual that effectively says that they are now the property of their husband instead of their father, when actually they were never either.
We think that now that women are independent and are able to work outside the home and have the same roles in society as men, at least in theory, that ultimately marriage is no longer super relevant, because marriage existed as a way for society to answer the question how do we make sure that we know whose children women are having, how do we control women's bodies.
And that was a big concern obviously in roman medieval early modern times for passing on property and titles and things like that, but that's not a concern today because people are allowed to have children with whomever they want.
Our second argument is that society is getting less religious.
So even if you don't buy my kind of basic sociological explanation for marriage, we tell you that the religious explanation for marriage in christian societies is that it's a sacrament before god, and we think that other religions have a similar interpretation, that marriage is something you do with god, or god's sanctioning to people's relationship.
But billions of people around the world now no longer practice any religion, whether that be in communist china where you have over a billion non religious people, or even in the united states or europe where you have tens and tens and tens of millions of people who are atheists or otherwise just don't practice a religion.
We think that at that point, there's no need for society to set up an institution that allows people to sanction their relationship in god's eyes.
That's just not what people are concerned with anymore.
At the point where many people don't even look at marriage in this light, we think that it's clear that marriage has moved so far away from what it was even fifty years ago, that it's no longer even fulfilling the purposes that it used to.
At that point I think it's clear that marriage is outdated, and is not adapting to society's needs.
Our third and final argument is that marriage is incompatible with many modern lifestyles.
So I mentioned earlier that the status of women has changed in society in the last hundred years pretty drastically, but at the same time we've also seen the acceptance of people in same sex relationships, of people choosing to have children as single parents, we think that ultimately, these are all lifestyles that simply didn't exist a hundred years ago because they were unacceptable, but that are growing more and more common.
The other team might say that, "" oh, we can have same sex marriage in countries like america now "", but we think that first of all, this is temporary, there's no guarantee that this will remain in existence, and on top of that, that expanding the definition of marriage to the point that it includes these groups that were historically excluded from it indicates that marriage itself is no longer relevant.
You have to make the definition so broad that the original idea of marriage is lost.
We don't think that's any great loss on our side, but we do think it indicates that marriage is outdated.
So at the end of the day we see that because many many people are choosing to live happy fulfilling lives without the institution of marriage, in a way that was quite difficult a hundred or two hundred years ago, that the institution of marriage has become outdated.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish antisocial behavior orders.
Two main areas of clash.
The first on why it is anti free speech.
We think first that it provides way too much power to the society in which someone currently finds themselves in.
What we mean by this, is that given that these antisocial behavior orders are regional, if someone is in a predominantly white christian society, it is very likely that a completely different class of behavior would be regulated than say if someone is living in an inner city in primarily minority communities what they would choose to regulate.
We think that both of these extremes tend to be bad insofar as we don't think that any majority ought be able to oppress a minority using these these kinds of orders.
Insofar as this is truly just a form of oppression of saying hey these are behaviors that we have communally decided are incorrect rather than for some actual impact and enforcing that will upon a free individual.
So we think that what this ultimately does besides just the principle of why it is like oppressive, is that it creates over policing in areas in which it should not be so.
We think that a lot of the time there are many behaviors that individuals to dislike but in the end are not ultimately harmful or completely debilitating to them.
We think that a lot of the time you get incredibly racist individuals or even slightly racist not incredibly racist individuals who might look down upon individuals say who are listening to really loud rock music or those who are wearing their pants too low.
We think or women who aren't wearing things that are deemed physically appropriate enough for them and so we think a lot of the time these kinds of orders are going to tilt to lot of over policing like racist or sexist policies in conservative areas.
We think at the end of the day liberal areas have infinitely less reason to use them except to regulate maybe hate speech which we still think applies as a with all of these arguments in terms of being a violation of free speech but we also think it's just infinitely worse that you're giving the power to conservative areas to do things like tell black men to keep their pants up, like prevent people from listening to music, tell women that they have to wear certain clothing or dress code them effectively.
Like these are all capabilities that probably ought be kept out of a majority hand given that it impacts an individual's right to self-actualize and an individual's right to right to like present themselves in whatever so way they choose.
At the end of the day, we way their right to like basically self-actualize against any kind of minor discomfort that these larger groups might be experiencing.
At the end of the day, we think that these larger groups can always look away or ask them to leave politely or any number of other alternatives whereas these individuals truly have much less of an outlet for their whatever desires they are portraying given that they're only one facing many more.
But also we think that this has incredibly problematic impacts and in terms of activism and how those gatherings look because we think it's really easy for a group of individuals who don't want social movements to gather or politically advocate in a certain area, to portray those groups as doing something that is considered antisocial.
Like shouting in public can be incredibly destructive even if it is to meet a politically good goal however, because it still falls under the blanket of shouting in public, you could presumably put them into civil court under this kind of motion.
The second area of clash is about how it's unnecessary and frankly dangerous to individuals.
At the end of the day, if something is truly bad and truly criminal then it's going to be legislated by law and if it's not yet then we think that it's good to force these laws to go through multiple levels of checks before you actually apply them to the individual insofar as that is how you make sure that they truly don't have adverse effects.
We think it's just not the case that the average person is qualified to dictate the laws by which we live the rest of our lives over other people.
This is why we do things like elect judges or make sure that people have adequate schooling before these make they make these decisions or to soon up unbiased manner.
We think generally we prefer a more free society in which individuals do as close to what they prefer as possible.
This is because fundamentally in a democracy we want people to be able to self-actualized as they see fit and it is incredibly unlikely that anyone knows your circumstance more than you.
At the end of the day, most people respond to extreme shaming anyway.
So we don't understand why you should be getting them into civil court.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should legalize insider trading.
Three independent points: first is that legalization of insider trading makes for better markets.
I think the status quo constitutes a lot of guessing.
At least in terms of the stock market.
And the reason for this is quite simple that when you, you know, don't have the ability to use insider information you really don't know much about what's going on at the company.
You're being told: "" I'm gonna make a bet based on what I think might happen to the company. ""
And that's inherently pretty risky.
Generally speaking, if we were talking about you know people betting on their own money, I think that'd be a lot more reasonable to say.
But the problem is that they're not betting with their own money most of the time.
These are you know people's retirement funds were talking about.
Their life savings often.
This is something that has a really profound impact on the economy at large and if entire portfolios come crashing down because of a lack of knowledge on what was about to happen at the firm, that's a serious harm on a lot of people.
This is really important then to ensure that these markets operate in a way that minimizes risk.
And I think having insider trading, having knowledge of the way that a specific industry is working and allowing people to make decisions based on the most knowledge possible is always going to insure more stability within that market.
Our second independent point is that legalization of insider trading leads to more transparency.
The reason for this is essentially that in the status quo people try to engage in insider trading anyway.
That they find out information about what's happening in a firm and they try to act on that information, because this is you know just reasonable.
This is just what people do when they have an opportunity to make money they'll take that opportunity.
But in the status quo, because it is illegal, there are serious serious efforts to mask that knowledge.
I think that comes with its own harms though.
That when your you know top priority, to an extent, is to avoid prison by masking the fact that you engage in insider trading, you will be less transparent as a firm.
You will be less open about the rationale for why you make specific decisions.
That's a problem.
That means that our market is essentially operating on lies, is operating on you know faulty assumptions and the ways in which are really this entire industry works becomes a lot more obscured.
This is an issue.
We want to understand what's going on behind closed doors in this industry to mitigate the likelihood of abuse.
We want to mitigate any type of abuse really that happens within the financial industry, and I don't think encouraging people to be you know shady because of basically just our gut reaction to fairness, is a is a strong justification for why we should you know be less knowledgeable about what's going on.
The last thing I want to touch on, our third independent point is that fairness question.
Generally speaking it seems that the opposition to insider trading is largely rooted in this fairness claim.
That it's unfair when people have a disproportionately larger amount of information about specific deal and that this gives some people a leg up.
I think that this reasoning is inherently flawed though because for starters everyone always has a leg up, for some reason or another.
You know whether or not your firm just has a lot of money gives you a leg up.
Whether or not your experience in the industry gives you a leg up.
There are a lot of reasons why it individual might have an advantage.
I think the the tipping point in whether or not we take steps to mitigate that advantage is whether or not that advantage is unfairly earned.
I don't know where you set that bright line but it seems like we have a lot of advantages in the status quo, like being born wealthy, that are lot less fair than working to achieve insider information.
Like, insider information means you worked for the company, you have an intricate understanding of its operations, like this is a skill essentially.
I think this has a much stronger merit claim that a lot of other ways in which people get advantages, and at that point I think it's a lot more reasonable then to allow people to profit off of the knowledge or skill in the way that we do in other industries.
Proud to propose."
"We should abandon the insanity plea.
So by this we mean that in western countries they should get rid of the ability for defendants to plead that they are innocent because of mental illness.
This is distinct from saying that we should treat these people exactly the same as anyone else.
Were okay with having, you know, sentencing people to time in mental hospitals, or holding people in separate conditions, or treating mental illness as a mitigating factor, but we don't think that you should be able to use mental illness as the only reason to be found not guilty for committing a crime.
Two reasons: the first is about the rights of victims.
Recognize that when you have been the victim of a crime, you deserve recompense and you deserve retribution.
But how do you get recompense and retribution?
Well first of all, if there's been some sort of financial damage to you, we think that deserves to be fulfilled.
If someone is found not guilty, recognize that neither they nor their insurance can be made to pay out as a result of their actions, because those aren't their actions as such.
So we think that finding someone not guilty due to criminal insanity ultimately is going to allow them to avoid paying out to the victim, which means that the victim has suffered a harm and isn't receiving any compensation to make up for that harm.
We think this is very unjust.
Just because someone has mental illness doesn't mean that they shouldn't have to pay for damage that they do, or that their insurance shouldn't have to pay out for damage that they do.
So ultimately, we see that there is a clear harm to the victims of crimes who would be receiving compensation and who aren't because of these not guilty or non sentencing because of the insanity plea.
But next, we think that victims deserve to have some sort of retribution.
If you've suffered a violent crime for instance, we think that you deserve to know that the person who harmed you is being punished for their actions, and that you are safe.
We think that the only way that this can be guaranteed is by convicting the criminal so that we can actually put them away and keep them away from the general public.
This is the only way that the victim can feel safe, and to know that justice has been done.
Since the victim has done nothing wrong, we think that they ought always be prioritized above the accused, and in this instance that means putting their recompense and retribution above some perceived harm to the criminal.
So our second reason why we ought not or why we ought abandon the insanity plea is about why we actually convict in the first place.
So recognize that when we convict people, normally we look for a guilty deed and a guilty mind.
So something bad that happened, and some ill intent that because that bad thing to happen.
The guilty deed obviously had to happen.
If nothing's gone wrong then there's no reason for there to be a criminal trial.
But the guilty mind sometimes isn't enough.
So we tell you that for instance, manslaughter in the US is a crime when you kill someone without intent.
So you have the guilty deed but not the guilty mind.
But people still go to jail every year for manslaughter.
So we see that the state can punish people, even if they were acting not with any particular intent, simply because of the guilty deed.
So it may be true that a criminally insane person doesn't have a guilty mind, but if their actions lead to death or grave harm, we think that it would be principally consistent with this idea to put them in jail simply for the guilty act they or guilty deed that they've committed.
But on top of that, we're okay with convicting people of a lesser crime if necessary.
So for instance, if somebody was on trial for killing another person, maybe because of mental illness they would be found not to have had a guilty mind and so they would be put away for manslaughter rather than put away for murder in the second or first degree, but ultimately some punishment would still be meted out, and justice would still be done.
We think that that would be a better way to handle these scenarios than to have an insanity plea that would then lead to no punishment or no acknowledgement that this person committed a crime.
Sp for these reasons, we think that we should abandon the insanity plea.
Thank you."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition today defending the motion that reality television does more harm than good.
Before beginning, it's important to note two burdens in this round.
First, that programming is zero-sum, that a TV station makes a deliberate choice about what to put on its air and that in the absence of reality television, something is going to go on there.
It doesn't have to be, you know, PBS or sesame street or something extremely wholesome and beneficial to society.
But as long as that something is marginally less harmful than reality television, as long as that something is even just a silly sitcom, something vapid like a show about nothing that doesn't create active harm, that's preferable.
And secondly, it's important to recognize that just because you want something, doesn't make it good.
The fact that people demand reality television, that this is something they want, doesn't mean that it is an intrinsically good thing for society.
With that, three independent points that I'd like to make.
First, that reality television is unrealistic.
Second, that it creates outside celebrity personalities.
And third, that it distorts the market of television at large.
On the first point of unrealistic nature: recognize that reality television is manufactured for product.
For example, the tense drama "" big brother "" is something that is selectively edited in order to create a greater effect for the viewer.
This is things like absurd situations, like "" the bachelor "", where twenty women vie for the attention of one man.
These are manufactured situations that, even if they are nominally reality television, are not actually reflective of the world that we live in.
This is problematic because, especially for children, it normalizes the idea that this is something that we experience on a real day-to-day basis.
Unlike a cartoon or even a sitcom, it's not it's treated as though this is the real world, this is this is something that is normal and you should expect, that the idea of twenty women competing for a single man is a normal thing that you should expect in your life, that always being adversarial with everyone around you because you're literally in a competition with them, is the way we live our day-to-day lives.
These are bad norms, and when reality television is there preaching to children that this is the way you should live your life, that's a harm on society.
My second independent point is that it creates outside celebrity personalities.
This is a system that assigns worth to people like pauly shore, people that don't have something intrinsic that they can give to society, something that is actually beneficial.
The best-case scenario for this is someone like pauly shore, that's just annoying.
But the-worst case is someone that's assigned value, like trump, someone that is cast as a smart businessman despite a track record that is absolutely in opposition to that.
Given this, we think it's important to recognize that reality television routinely cranks out personalities that are assigned significantly more worth than their actual contributions to society ought give them.
Whether this is a small impact or a big impact, it still means that the world is worse off for reality television.
And my third independent point is that it distorts the market for other forms of television.
Other content on television is incentivized to conform to the larger norms that are established by reality television, things like the ability to captivate an audience to keep them glued to the screen.
These marketing techniques that reality television utilizes, this has a profound effect on things like news, for example.
See nancy grace, a product of true crime fascination.
A woman who, in the united states, made a career out of dramatizing unproved murder mysteries, things that were unresolved from a police perspective, that she dramatize.
This is a direct product of the reality television revolution, that other portions of television took their lessons from reality television and repurposed them in an easily digestible package.
This isn't something that's isolated to this form of television.
It's had a profound effect on everything ranging from children's cartoons to the day-to-day information that we accept as fact from trusted news agencies.
Because this isn't an isolated incident, you can't look at it as just the impact of what an individual show, like say, american idol, has had on a person.
You have to recognize that this is something that has largely made american society and global society much much worse off.
Proud to propose."
"We should ban fishing.
I think the important thing to note is that we're not banning just like "" father son go out to fish "", rather we are talking specifically about commercial fishing, and we would require licenses for other types of non-commercial fishing.
So, your father and son can still go out to fish after your father has completed the appropriate license and certification and has agreed to not fish in areas that have species that are likely to be going towards extinction or anything similar.
With that, three main areas of clash: first, on overfishing.
Recognize that we are going through a period of time in which we are overfishing the waters and the oceans more than we ever have before.
Populations that we rely on for food, but more importantly that the ocean relies on for consistent ecosystems, are near extinct in the status quo that have never, ever, ever been extinct in the past.
This impacting on the population of fish is very bad.
For example, the tuna, which is a common staple in a lot of different diets but is especially fished in japan, is almost extinct right now of many different breeds and very difficult to find, which drives the price of tuna up.
This is bad not just because this means no more food or very expensive food for us, but it also does things like impact the diversity in those waters in the ocean.
This first we think that we value diversity just for its sake, because we think having different species is good, but more than this, we think that affecting the way that this interacts with food chains and the way that this interacts with the ecosystem is devastating for the area, devastating for like the ocean's broad hole and the way that they interact but just bad for the world as like a moral harm.
This is especially bad because many of the fish don't even get eaten, rather they're caught, they're killed, and they are thrown back into the water, because they are not good for human consumption and or they just never got bought because there are there're too many fish in the market.
We think that this these nets also often catch animals outside of the target population that we're talking about so, very often, even though this net is out for like, say, crab or lobster, or maybe you're trying to catch tuna, you're likely to catch other fish as well.
And because this is commercial fishing, so large amounts of fish all at once, it's very rare that people sift through every single net to try and release back into the waters the ones that they don't want.
So it oftentimes hurts other populations.
Our second area of clash is about pollution.
Because the large fishing vessels that do things like exude waste gases into the ocean, dump trash and other waste back in the ocean, and also interact with the land docks and fisheries that exist on land, but oftentimes let their waste out into the water, are incredibly bad for the environment.
It pollutes the ocean water which kills fish and other ocean environments.
This is really bad because things like the coral reef, which is dying out through due to a combination of pollution and overfishing, becomes something that we can never look at again.
But also because there are beings that live there that we think we value the life of.
Our third area of clash, though, is about negative externalities.
Because recognize that fish participate in food chains, which I've mentioned a couple of times before, and it impacts the ecosystem when you mess the food chain equilibria.
So say that you have plankton which get eaten by the fish of interest, we'll say tuna for now, which get eaten by a certain type of shark type.
When you eliminate the fish of interest due to overfishing, you increase the population of plankton and decrease the population of shark types that you're talking about.
This affects a million other chains that these species are part of, not just the fish of interest, but also now the increased population of plnkton, the decreased population of shark.
This is really bad because it affects other population and further destroys ocean systems, but this is also bad because things like boats and other parts tend to hurt other sea life.
For example, you'll have large sea turtles that are often the victim of boat propellers that suck them in and kill them.
Insofar as these are all beings that probably have some claim to live in the areas that they live before humans decided to invade, kill them off, and use them for food commercially, we think that you ought ban fishing.
Proud to propose."
"I'm proud to support the motion that we should ban hate sites.
Three independent points: the first of which is that from a principled perspective it is justified to ban hate speech in any form.
So we think a lot of what opposition is going to tell you is going to revolve around the notion that these sites constitute a form of speech, and as such we must protect free speech because of the principled justifications for why we respect that in the first place.
So I'll get into, later, the reasons why we don't think this necessarily extends to the internet, but from a broader more principled perspective we think it's important to squash hate speech no matter what context that arises in.
The reason for this is that even if we fundamentally believe that people should have a right to free speech, we think that hate speech necessarily infringes upon the free speech of those who are the victims of it.
So when you are in a sort of like public discourse type setting, like say politics or the internet, you're often going to see that there will be people attempting to basically tamp down the views of individuals.
And especially for historically oppressed minorities and other groups that are likely to be the victims of hate speech, we think this is an especially high risk that needs to be looked out for.
We think that if you allow the internet to become sort of this like volatile cesspool that it often is where say LGBT people or people of color don't feel comfortable expressing their views and like identities openly, out of risk of you know essentially being targeted by these forms of hate speech, we think that necessarily then runs over their right to be able to speak freely.
At the point then where these to run counter to one another, we think it just makes more sense to favor the rights of the victims over the rights of people who have actively created harm in the world.
Our second independent point is that even if you do think that hate speech is free speech and should be protected, we don't think that free speech rights extend to internet discourse.
The reason for this is that the internet has the capacity to create significantly more harm from statements that would be otherwise innocuous as said just like face to face.
The reason for this is the broader audience.
So when we consider limits on free speech, usually the standard we use is whether or not it creates harm.
So the fire in a crowded theater sort of standard.
That's a lot more likely to happen on the internet when you have a broader audience that is more likely to be persuaded by your statements because you're getting that greater access.
We don't think however that there is a necessary trade-off in terms of the person's ability to express these viewpoints.
We think that person's right to say as they want still exists if you can't do so on the internet.
The internet is simply one forum and as long as we allow access to other reasonable forums, like say the news, or just interpersonal discourse, and like talking to your friends and things like that, we don't think that necessarily this is a necessarily large infringement on those rights, weighed against the larger magnitude of harm created by this particular forum.
Our third and final independent point is the forms of discourse that occur when we're talking about this speech.
So I think the other main argument that op is going to bring up is going to be something to the effect of: "" look, sunlight is the best disinfectant.
If we allow people to talk about this that will be able to sort of shut down their ideas and explain to people what's wrong with them. ""
I think the problem with that argument is that discourse doesn't really work like that on the internet.
Like if you look at any comment thread or you know or readit chain or whatever, like looking at any of the sort of conversations that happen on the internet, it's not a forum that's very facilitative to people having conversations.
This is partly because of the anonymity of the internet but it's also partly because this isn't something that's happening on a face to face basis.
You don't have to listen to the other person.
We think if we shut down this type of discourse from occurring on the internet it will instead gravitate to more you know facilitative forums.
Places where actual conversations have to happen like say on the news, or just enough to face to face conversation.
We think then, if sunlight is the best disinfectant it's important to force these conversations to happen in a place where there is sun light.
Proud to propose."
"Year round schooling will bring more good than harm.
So by year round schooling we mean a system where students go to school for several weeks, and then have a short break.
As opposed to a system where students go for months at a time and then have a very long break.
So perhaps on our side we're defending a world where students go to school for eight weeks and have two weeks off, and on the other side they're defending a system where students go to school for eight months and then have three months off.
So, our first argument is that students will learn better with year round schooling.
Students forget a great deal of material over the summer, which then has to be re-learned at the beginning of the next school year.
For instance, many students forget advanced mathematical concepts and have a more difficult time adjusting when they get back to school.
This means that valuable instruction time is spent not on new material or on the kind of helpful review that we do every day, but rather on re-teaching material that students have forgotten.
And since no two students are the same, it seems likely that some will remember what the others have forgotten, and ultimately he will not use class time as effectively.
We also tell you that there are some skills, like second language, that need to be practiced every day or they will be lost.
So for instance if you're teaching english as a second language at your school, those students will likely forget a great deal of vocabulary and lose speaking proficiency, if they aren't practicing every day during a several months of long break.
We also tell you that we can probably have students go to school for a longer period of time every year using this system.
Burnout is a real phenomenon.
It is true that students couldn't go to school every single day.
Children, especially younger children, simply don't have the capacity to focus day in and day out the way that adults do.
But we tell you that we could better fight burnout by having a short break every few weeks, rather than having one very long break.
For instance, american students tend to go to school for less than two hundred days a year because they have such a long break, in order to avoid burnout.
But finnish and japanese students often go to school well over two hundred and forty days a year, so they actually get more contact hours.
It's unsurprising then that countries like finland or south korea or japan, which have year round schooling, also have the best schools and the best students.
We tell you that these students are doing better than their peers in the US or britain, simply because they have more contact hours.
It's difficult for students to learn if they're not around their teacher for months on end, and if they're wasting all their time reviewing.
So we think that it's clear that students would learn better and learn more with year round schooling, and that alone is enough of a reason for us to implement it, because obviously the purpose of schools in the first place is to educate students.
But on top of that, our second argument is that we think this is better for parents, especially low income parents.
So right now, having your children home for a very long break in the summer means spending a lot of money on daycare.
If you have children who are under say, thirteen, and can't be home for a long period of time on their own, and if you don't have a lot of people in your community who can look after them, then you have to spend money on daycare, which is very expensive in many parts of the world for low income families.
We also tell you that in many places where schools provide breakfast or lunch to students, families are under more food distress during the summer break, because they have to provide more meals for their children.
This often means that children get worse nutrition during the summer.
I'm reminded of the community where I grew up where churches would send food home with kids during the summer, because otherwise they just wouldn't have anything to eat, it's quite sad.
And we tell you that you can reduce this by having children be in school more often so that we know that they're being fed properly, because they're eating two good meals a day at school.
So we think that this would be better and take some burden off of parents.
And lastly we think it would be easier to plan family travel if you didn't have everyone in the country trying to travel in december, but rather spread out throughout the year.
So we think that year round schooling will bring more good than harm, because it's better for children and better for their parents.
Thank you."
"We should ban cosmetic surgery.
We're at the very beginning we're just going to differentiate between cosmetic surgery being surgery that's done specifically and only for the enhancement of one's appearance, and reconstructive surgery which is a type of cosmetic surgery to repair scarring or other types of things that occur after someone's been injured or harmed in some particular manner.
We think that we should ban cosmetic surgery specifically because its existence perpetuates and allows the continuation of bad norms.
What are we talking about when we mean bad norms?
We think that cosmetic surgery first perpetuates the idea that there is some sort of idealized human form that individuals should strive to achieve.
Cosmetic surgery exists to do certain things to change an individual's appearance, and these types of things fall in line of very specific types of gender norms and body norms that exist in society today.
For example, the idea of having your facelift so that you have fewer wrinkles, or other things done to your face to make oneself look younger, and to make oneself look as if they were as if they were more naturally gifted.
What does this mean and what is the problem with that?
It means that individuals who exist in the normal world where they have bodies that aren't in this idealized form, which is the vast majority of individuals, feel ostracized within their society and feel that either a, they need to do this type of thing where they spend a vast amount of money on cosmetic surgery that isn't necessary in order to appear a specific way, which we ultimately don't think is going to make individuals feel any better about themselves, because this idea of an idealized form is something that we believe is simply unachievable, that once individuals find flaws within themselves and find this nagging need to fix those small flaws that they see, individuals are going to perpetually see those flaws, and we can bet cosmetic surgery is a route by which individuals can abuse themselves by correcting flaws that are simply not flaws in the first place.
We think when you ban cosmetic surgery you remove this type of idealized form, maybe not in the imaginary of individuals immediately, but we think what you do is you make it more difficult for individuals to change their appearance and more difficult for society to perpetuate this idea, especially in the higher classes of an idealized form and what that form is particularly, and we think that this is especially problematic issues for young people and for specifically young girls who already are feeling immense pressure about how their bodies need to appear through things like beauty magazines and other sorts of societal norms that are pushed on to these individuals.
We think that these people are specifically prone and specifically likely to be pushed into doing these types of things and taking drastic moves to change their appearance, which we think is something that is not acceptable within our society.
We think that when people at a young age are made make themselves feel as if they are lesser because of how they appear it leads to a whole sort of issues such as body dysmorphia and other eating disorders that occur when individuals think that their body is not the ideal form it leads to self harm and to depression when individuals can't feel like they're safe, or that their okay in their own skin, and we can bet cosmetic surgery, and the cult around cosmetic surgery, the social norms that surround cosmetic surgery, this idealized form that comes with it, we think that that type of problem is ultimately what leads to these things in our society and leads to a greater impact of the social norms that we have in the status quo.
Finally, we think that the idea that you can simply change the way you appear leads to types of body shaming against people, firstly against overweight people who are seen as those that are too lazy to change how they feel or don't care about how they feel or don't care about how they look, and we think that this type of body shaming is increased when you have things such as cosmetic surgery to change things, to tuck your tummy, to change how fat you look, all of those types of things.
We think that body shaming and these types of norms are particularly perpetuated through cosmetic surgery because it gives an avenue or a purported avenue to change the way you feel, and puts the onus on individuals to change the way they appear or to fall in line with those norms, rather than the onus on society to accept that these norms don't exist, and for these reasons, we think that you should ban cosmetic surgery."
"We should increase government regulation.
We're going to limit this specifically to discussion about corporate regulation we think that currently in the status quo the government has a lot of environmental and economic regulations on large corporations that exceed a specific size we're fine with going along with the pre existing standards for what qualifies as a corporation but we would prefer for the government to continue and expand the current regulations on those entities.
Two main areas of clash, first government regulation as an obligation.
Recognize the government exists for a reason.
Large groups of people are willing to give up their rights to an entity so that it would do something and that something is to protect them and structure a society.
We think that people give up a lot of rights.
They allow limitations on their privacy, on their movement, and we think that they deserve to see a result from that insofar as these kinds of like trade offs are quite large.
Like I think that in a world in which I am capable of providing for myself better than the government I would definitely do that because without a government I would be able to do a lot more things that I would probably desire to do like borders wouldn't exist and I'd be able to acquire food possibly more easily but we see that like the reason that we are willing to do things like not live in anarchy is because we see the benefit to what governments can provide us with ie they can protect us from exploitation and we think that the government when the government doesn't regulate corporations they are denying the largest exploiter of of like the common man are the corporations that exist as powerful aggregates with large amounts of capital that do things like set very low wages, provide unsafe working conditions, and so forth.
We think that when the government doesn't regulate corporations, it isn't fulfilling its job or its obligation to the people it allows other actors to dominate people's lives which is bad because we think that generally the government ought be ensuring freedom for for its substituents.
Moreover we think the government needs to prioritize those least represented and most vulnerable because because these are individuals who tend not to be able to defend themselves they don't have alternatives for jobs when the corporations are going to pay them trash they don't have the political lobbying to keep corporations from dumping pollutants into their homes and we think that corporations are the biggest offenders of this which is why the government has to regulate them.
Our second area of clash is about government regulation as a pragmatic good.
When unregulated, corporations rather than people tend to take power.
This is because corporations exist as aggregations of the most powerful individuals in society, those who have the majority of the fiscal capital, those who have a lot of social sway like those who had good educations so on so forth.
These groups can create regional monopolies for jobs.
It's really easy for them to force cooperation from the general populace even when it's bad for the general populace because they do things like offer them jobs that can provide them with sustenance because they might create economic growth in a specific area we see a lot of cities in the united states and a lot of small towns that are dominated by one particular corporation because that just happened to be the corporation that placed itself there first and demanded all of their energy.
But we also see that this is really bad because these are also the areas that are polluted the most and when that corporation goes down these are the people who are suffering the most.
Powerful corporations are absurdly abusive.
They pollute in people's homes especially in poor areas, they create poor working conditions, low wages, they don't pay like whenever the government doesn't regulate them monetarily, they don't pay very high taxes, they try to maximize their profit margins and we think that it is very necessary for the government regulation to serve the pragmatic way to protect the people most likely to get taken advantage of by these entities.
We think that it prevents corporations from owning the government as well.
We see that in the status quo large lobbying powers prevent the government from being able to effectively regulate.
We think this was created by a lack of regulation in the first place.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should raise corporate tax.
So I think that we're going to define certain barrier of corporations.
We think that only those that are relatively large, so let's say like they earned a like a lot more money than like we think that we can classify in different ways, based on like employee size and how much they make, what a large corporation will be, and I think that's where you like going to raise the corporate tax considerably.
And we think it's like a progressive tax, like smaller corporation get a lower one, larger corporations get a really big one, but it would be a raise to whatever we currently have.
With that, two main areas of clash: first on the principle justification for why it is okay to do so.
Recognize the corporations have plenty of money and that this money is made massively because of capitalist system that inherently oppresses the poor.
Recognize that it relies on having cheap labor and consumers that are relatively ill informed of their other alternatives so that they will buy this object, and it takes large amounts of available wealth away from those that might be able to use it better or use it to lift themselves out of poverty.
So at the point that all of this is true we think that capitalism, but also just the systems with which corporation's rise to power at all, are structurally disadvantaging those in poverty, and so we actually think that this is very very bad and as such they owe a larger debt back to society due to the drain that they have caused.
And and then we also just like want to note that a lot of the time they also politically disadvantage the individuals so that people can get other policy passed, which means that this kind of policy would be helpful in counteracting some of the political influence they have as well.
But second I want to talk about marginal utility.
Because we think that ten dollars to a wealthy person means less than to someone who is actively struggling, for whom lunch is maybe something they don't know if they can afford, and this is something that can massively help them in such a way.
And we think the problem is that that when you take some money away from corporation it's fine insofar as they will have enough money either way.
Like at most some high level CEO's will earn a little bit less on our side of the house.
But we're fine with that because a lot more money goes into the social system and helps those who are going to be able to use this money most effectively either way.
Our second area of clash is about increasing societal good.
Because recognize that this money can be used very effectively, rather than to take rich people out to lunches that they'd be able to afford either way, or like become the inheritance that rich children acquire after their parents passed.
And we think that that's like very bad and we prefer for that money to go back into the economy and like do social good.
We think that being able to redistribute wealth, either through welfare or through direct investment, back into economy has better social outcomes than the things that I just listed that rich people do.
First recognize that welfare structurally helps those in need.
Being able and like a lot of the time welfare specifically is incredibly underfunded and doesn't actually get like the amount of money that it needs to service the large amount of individuals that would come to rely on it.
We think the problem with that is that there's like no one actively giving into that system or helping it enough.
So we think that when you take money from a corporations and put it into welfare you're actually creating a world in which you're able to help those most in need more than you currently are.
Like provide more food stamps, provide better public housing, invest in programs like education and cheaper colleges, and this is really important because it makes individuals who have previously been signed off by society into people who can actively be more productive and helpful.
And we think that it's good when individuals are able to achieve their potential regardless of the fact that they were born into a situation that, outside of their control, pushed them into a box.
We also think that economic investment is more macro scale beneficial in a lot of ways as well.
We think that taking money away from already established corporations and putting it into start ups is what actually stimulates our economy.
Insofar corporations that have created monopolies just stagnate, don't attract new investors, and oftentimes keep a lot of the wealth among themselves so that there's not actually any kind of trickle down, we think that when you are able to support things like start ups or able to put that money elsewhere you're actually stimulating better economic growth on our side of the house.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should ban the sale of violent video games to minors.
So, basically, what we're talking about are games like the famous doom, which the columbine shooters were playing before they shot up their school, or more modern games, like call of duty or halo, which feature graphic violence and often have the player , you know, killing other people or doing other violent acts.
We would be okay with the sale of games that have cartoonish violence, so something like mario, but we think that the super realistic type of violence is what we should be banning from the sale to minors.
So, three main arguments for why this is true.
First, these games cause children to internalize harmful norms.
If you grow up playing these games, where you are the hero and you execute lots of people or kill enemies, we think that you internalize the norm that violence is a way to solve your problems.
Now the other team is going to say that people don't actually learn anything from video games, but we think that young people are deeply influenced by the media that they consume, that this is why, generally speaking, we try to set up positive role models for young people in fiction.
Think of characters like dumbledore, say.
A useful way to think of this is through the lens of virtue ethics, that if a good person is someone who acts like a good person, then you need to give young people lots of examples of good people so that they can develop into them.
At the point where, in our society, using violence or guns to solve your problems is not acceptable, we think that we shouldn't encourage young people to play video games where this is the case.
But video games go beyond even other forms of media.
Because you are actively participating rather than passively consuming, I think it's much more likely that they change the way that you actively participate with other parts of your life.
If you spend hundreds of hours playing a game where you go around killing people, then you're probably much more likely to vote for a politician who wants to go kill people abroad, or to go out and buy a gun when you're older because you're more comfortable with the idea of owning and using a gun.
We think that all of these are antisocial outcomes of socializing young people with these types of video games and that these are all sufficient to ban their sale.
Our second argument is that we think that the sale of video games ought be consistent with other types of media.
Where I live, at the very least, people under the age of seventeen aren't allowed to go and see very violent or sexual movies.
Even if you're with your parents, there is a law that says that you can't go in and see certain films because they're just too graphic.
We think that it's ridiculous that movies, which you consume passively for about two hours, are heavily regulated whereas video games, which you might play for a hundred hours and which are very active, are not similarly regulated, particularly when oftentimes the content in these video games wouldn't even be allowed in a movie in my country.
At that point, we think that the law ought be principally consistent and apply the same standards to video games as to films, and ban the sale of these games to minors.
We already have rating systems that would facilitate this: you have r-rated movies and m-rated video games.
We think that this situation is pretty much analogous.
Our last point is that we think that this would disincentivize the creation of hyper-violent video games.
Ideally, we tell you you wouldn't want these extremely violent games to exist at all, because even adults consuming these things probably perverts their idea of what is normal or acceptable.
I mentioned earlier about people supporting violent politicians, but if you play a game where you go and kill people in an environment that's very similar to iraq, it seems much more likely to me that you would be willing to tolerate US marines going and doing exactly the same thing.
In particular, many of these games lionize groups, like the US military, so that people don't think critically about politicians and the military.
So, ultimately, we think that if you ban the sale of these games to children, they're less financially profitable and fewer of them are made, which means that you get fewer of these harmful outcomes.
Thank you."
"We should ban racial profiling for two reasons.
First because it's a violation of rights and second because it actually makes people less safe.
So first, why is racial profiling a violation of rights?
Let's start by looking at the fact that it is an inherent rights violation.
Why is this true?
Because the because by the lottery of birth, people don't really have any control over where they're born into.
That's not something that you actually choose, you don't choose the color of your skin.
Or the religion that you grow up with, it's probably picked out by your parents.
So why do we think that this is important?
Because when you are profiling somebody on the base of their race, especially assuming criminality or terrorist motives to the basis of their race, or to a heightened presumption that they might be a perpetrator of such an action, it assigns blame to a race where it presumes blame onto a predominant group of people rather than assigning blame to individual people.
This is an incredibly big problem.
Because what it essentially is is a form of discrimination, because it means that the reason why someone is committing a crime is because they're a criminal because they have bad morals but that doesn't have anything to do with the color of their skin or the way in which they grew up.
But this is additionally yeah besides this just being an inherent rights violation we also believe that this will likely be a rights violation in the way that it's applied.
Why?
Because oftentimes police are able to take advantage of the leniency of society when it comes to safety measures.
This is very true in america, obviously, where you see shootings of unarmed black men on a tragically regular basis.
And that oftentimes convictions rarely if if ever follow and penalties are hardly ever more than a slap on the wrist.
This is clearly evident of a culture in which these things are permissible but additionally society also just scares easily.
You hear about instances of street harassment and bullying, acts of hate crimes against people, acts of hate crimes against muslims and islamophobia as rampant and these things are oftentimes stroked by media fears and when you and when you allow the use of racial profiling it essentially legitimizes that race can be a characteristic that could lead you wanting to identify somebody as a terrorist in the media and things like that.
So then I also think makes is like quite a violation of their rights because this is simply undeserved on their part.
But the next thing that I want to talk about is that I actually think that this makes society less safe.
Why is this true?
So first because it creates a presumption of where the threat is coming from, or expectation of who is actually threatening you that is ultimately not all that helpful in actually fighting threats.
Why?
Because terrorists and criminals belong to people of all races and religions and that just because some more happen to be come from some groups of people other than other groups of people when there is racial profiling allowed it usually focuses on the most prevalent groups.
This often comes at the expense of us not considering the threats that can come from people whom we may not expect them to come from.
So this ultimately makes you less safe in a lot of ways too.
But this is finally going to make people less safe because of the way in which the targeted groups of racial profiling react to this.
So even if you can make arguments that this isn't actually a violation of rights, the reality is is that the people involved in this, the people being targeted by this, do believe it is a rights violation.
What does this mean?
It means that it's just another example of society condemning these people who are already oftentimes not treated very well in society at large so I think that if anything this is going to make it more likely that people are going to, on the margins, turn to extremism or terrorism or more radical sects altogether.
And this is because they're going to be seen as less accepted by mainstream society.
They're not going to ever feel like they're secure in their own identity.
This is an incredibly this is incredibly messed up thing and it ultimately only makes it our society less safe and less secure.
So for all of those reasons we should definitely ban racial profiling."
"Social media does more harm than good.
So by social media we mean for instance, facebook, twitter, and similar computer programs where people are posting information about themselves and their life and photos, in order to communicate with their friends and their community, and talk to people about their experiences.
So with this in mind, we think that this debate comes down to whether or not the bad things that they do outweigh the good things.
Obviously there are some of both, but we don't think that the good things are enough to justify the bad.
So, three reasons.
First, alienation.
We think that although apps like facebook and twitter are supposed to make us feel closer to our community and our friends, they have exactly the opposite effect.
People see that their friends are going on incredible vacations and engaged in really amazing relationships and very fulfilled in work because facebook tends to show you good things rather than bad, and people feel worse about their own life.
We think that people feel ungrateful for what they have, that people feel like failures that people feel pressured to get into relationships that they shouldn't be in or to take jobs that they don't want because they think that they need to keep up.
There's this old expression about keeping up with the joneses, and we think that facebook is the new way that people try to do that.
They feel like they have to be doing as well as their neighbors so that they can post all of the stuff on line.
And they see it as a moral failing if they're not able to do so.
And all of this is despite the fact that nobody really pays attention to anyone else on social media, it's all actually just about making yourself feel good.
So at the end of the day, we see that social media makes people feel uncomfortable and alienated from their community, and that ultimately this is a really bad thing for a lot of people's mental health.
So our second point is about bullying, and I think this follows in a similar vein to the last point.
But we see that social media, in addition to being a powerful tool for people to be friends to one another, is also a really powerful tool for them to be cruel to one another.
This is especially true for younger people.
Bear in mind that many , young people, as young as twelve and thirteen, are heavily invested in social media.
They have smartphones and they're posting everyday about school and sports and things on twitter and facebook, sharing pictures on instagram, and always commenting on each other's posts.
And a lot of times this is used as a tool for bullying.
So the kinds of harmful interaction that you might say that's just part of being twelve that's just part of middle school, kids will grow out of it.
But where as that might have been true when we were younger, nowadays this bullying follows children into the home.
Because you can't just leave school and get away from the kids who are being mean to you, now you go home and they're commenting on your facebook and they're commenting on your instagram, twitter, whatever and ultimately being really cruel to you and you can't get away from it.
You might just say these people can choose to turn off their phone or disengage, but that is often seen as giving into the bullies or only gives them more ammunition to use against you.
So we see that social media has been a huge tool for the expansion of bullying, and that this is uniquely harmful for a lot of young people in society.
Our last point is about spying.
So what we mean by this is that governments can use social media very easily as a tool to monitor their own citizens.
This might be really blatant such as china setting up government owned social media, where they keep track of who post what, who was saying political things, who is meeting with who, and everyone knows that this is going on.
And in western countries where governments also monitor their citizens through social media, but they do it covertly and people don't realize that this is going on.
But the government is still gathering meta data, and twitter and facebook are still turning data over to the government about our everyday lives.
We think it's much harder for people to be private, to organize against undemocratic governments in places like the middle east, now the other team might point out the arab spring but also recognize that twitter and facebook were a tool for crack down, and for governments to find out who was part of the rebellions in the arab spring.
This is a pretty powerful tool for state spying, and we think that that outweighs the benefits for resistance and organization.
So for these reasons, we think that social media does more harm than good.
Thank you."
"We should end athletic scholarships.
We think there are a few reasons why we should no longer allow universities to give athletic scholarships to prospective students.
The first is that we think that this is an unfair distribution of financial resources that the university as at hand.
We we acknowledge that athletics can be valuable, but we certainly don't think that they are necessarily scholarly, nor do they match the mission of universities writ large.
Recognize that when you allow for athletic scholarships to be given to one individual, that's money from an endowment, that's money from the system, that otherwise could go to paying for the ability for other individuals to go that go to a school, individuals that have earned that entrance into the school because of scholarly achievement, because of the hard work that they put into it.
We think that education is a more even playing field when you allow for individuals that work hard, we think that education is a more even playing field than athletics will ever be.
And so when you allow for all of the money, all the possible endowment and financial aid to go to individuals that have earned it economically, we think that these are instances in which you allow for a more fair entrance into those universities, and you have a more generally balanced playing field.
We also think that you should promote education, because it's more valuable for the vast majority of people in the long run.
We think that athletic scholarships end up being a red herring for a huge amount of individuals.
We think that many high schoolers go into high school, end up playing athletic doing athletics in school, hoping that that will be their opportunity to go to college, even though the vast majority of high school athletes never get an athletic scholarship, never play in d one, and we think that that ends up being a false promise or a false expectation that leads to people being less focused on school and less focused on other opportunities, educational opportunities available to them in high school.
And this, obviously, has long-term implications.
But secondly, we want to talk about how student athletes are abused in the status quo.
Because this let's when you shift to the focus of individuals in university, we think that what ends up happening is that athletic scholarships aren't guaranteed for four years, which means individuals are continuously tied to athletic performance.
We think that this is a massive distraction from their ability to study, from their ability to get the education that they came to the university for.
What this means is that individuals end up being, in large part, in debt to the university when they have this athletic scholarship.
It means that they aren't able to focus on their education, and it's oftentimes used as a way to gain immense financial gains from these students.
Recognize that a huge amount of money is invested into d one sports such as basketball and football, money that never goes back to the students, except for in this pittance of athletic scholarships a relatively comparatively very small portion of all the money that comes from athletic proceeds.
We think that in the status quo you have a system in which athletic scholarships ensure that universities are able to continue this unfair gain over students, because students are constantly in need of getting those athletic scholarships and have very little ability to challenge the current hierarchy.
We think that individuals shouldn't be forced into this constrictive situation.
We think that in the status quo, individuals have their labor stolen from them for no monetary returns.
If you don't make them dependent on athletic scholarships, we think that they're, firstly, more likely to be able to get the education that will serve them in the long run ; secondly, before they enter college, be more likely to be focused on that education ; and thirdly, once they enter college, if they aren't dependent on athletic scholarships, they'll have more bargaining power for the labor that comes from their athletic ability.
So when you have people in athletics in the future, because we don't think you're going to end athletics in college altogether, we think that when people enter those athletics, they're more likely to have the bargaining power to make money off of that labor.
And for those three reasons, we should end athletic scholarships."
"We should increase fuel taxes.
So this is a debate talking about taxes on gas or petrol, taxes on diesel, taxes on natural gas for heating homes, any sort of fossil fuel that is used as fuel by the general public.
We think there should be higher taxes on it then there are right now in the status quo.
In the US for instance, this might take the form of rising gas taxes at the state level.
So two arguments.
First, how do we reduce the use of fossil fuels?
We think that right now there is an enormous cost to society from the use of fossil fuels by individuals.
If you look at things like rising CO two levels and pollution that the government has to clean up, we see that there are lots of costs to people choosing to drive gasoline cars, or to heat their homes with natural gas, and that most people use these methods over other methods because they are cheaper right now.
So if we make these methods more expensive, then one, people are paying the cost of the damage that they're doing more directly, and two, suddenly it makes sense for them to actually use other fuel sources instead.
Right now for instance, buying energy that's produced only through solar power rather than coal might be more expensive than buying electricity from a plant that produces by coal.
But by driving up the cost of electricity produced by burning coal, everyone will switch over to the cheaper solar powered energy.
We think that this is an effective tool because people one, want to have the lowest cost possible, and two, deserve to have to pay for the harms that they incur on the rest of society.
People shouldn't be able to freeload off of the government cleaning up after their pollution and mitigating the damage of their carbon dioxide.
The big impact of all this is that we think that the amount of CO two omitted would be much lower.
Many fewer people would choose to drive on their own, or to drive cars that use gas rather than hybrids.
Many fewer people would heat their homes using fossil fuels, and ultimately, national emissions would go way down, and this would make a more sustainable environment in the future.
So we think that's enough to win the debate.
But our second argument is about funding alternatives, because right now there's a lack of money actually going into finding alternatives to fossil fuels.
So why do we solve this?
First of all, we can earmark the money from the tax to go to developing alternative energy sources.
For instance, money that goes to or is raised by taxing coal emissions could be put towards building solar plants, or researching better solar technology.
Money that goes or is brought in from a gasoline tax might be put towards encouraging more people to drive cars powered by liquid natural gas, or encouraging people to drive more electric cars instead.
Perhaps we could give tax credits for electric cars, and in general make it easier for people to upgrade their old dirty technology to new, clean technology.
And on top of that, whereas right now there isn't a lot of infrastructure for the use of clean energy, we think that that infrastructure could be created on our side using this tax.
In other words, there are some people who will have to use fossil fuels no matter what, like certain big businesses that produce electricity, certain long haul trucks, et cetera.
These groups won't be able to cut back on use.
So money is going to be coming in from these taxes.
At the end of the day, therefore, we think that it is better to spend this money on infrastructure for the future, rather than to put it into a general fund where it'll just get sort of frittered away, and eventually we won't have that income as no one uses gas anymore.
So on our side we take advantage of the fact that we have this temporarily really high revenue stream, and use it to plan for a better future.
In this case that would be investing in things like charging stations for electric cars, or other ways for people to heat their homes, and ultimately we think that this will make the country more sustainable in the long term.
So because we reduce CO two emissions, and because we better future proof our country, we think that we should increase fuel taxes.
Thank you."
"We should ban smoking.
For the purposes of the debate, we want to clarify that we're talking about all types of smoking.
So many people associate the term smoking with tobacco and smoking cigarettes but to be clear, we would also ban the smoking of cannabis and other types of recreational drugs.
We think that falls directly in line with our advocacy for clarity for things that are kind of blurry, like cannabis usage.
We think that the debate isn't really particularly important there, but if there's some sort of medical benefit to whatever would not be allowed to be smoked if you consume it in another way, maybe that would be okay but we don't think that that is particularly relevant to the debate here.
So, why do we think that the government has a duty to ban smoking, and why do we think it's so important to ban smoking?
Let's start with the second thing because we think it's pretty clear.
So science is out on smoking.
It's very clear that the impacts of smoking tobacco or smoking in general is negative on the human body.
Firstly, any form of smoking itself deteriorates the lungs.
Inhaling smoke allows carcinogens to enter the lungs and ultimately damages them.
You can have serious long-run impacts.
Things like lung cancer and other respiratory issues are common for people that smoke any type of recreational drug, and ultimately leads to really long really harmful long-term long-term health problems.
Specifically with tobacco and with other substances like it, smoking cigarettes and things like that, also come with problems of addiction.
The issue with this is that firstly, there're already so many carcinogens that you're breathing in that you're likely, if you start smoking to begin with, to smoke in the long run.
It's very difficult to quit once you start smoking because of the powers of nicotine or for other drugs, because of their own inherent addictive qualities.
So, in those cases, this leads to not just harms to your health, but also economic harms for those people.
If you have an addiction, for example, if you smoke cigarettes, if you're smoking ten, fifteen packs of cigarettes a week, you are spending over a hundred, a hundred fifty dollars every week on something that is literally just going to kill you in the long run, and that's why it's so important to ban smoking.
We think people become smokers because of society.
We think that ability to access these types of things and the fact that other type of recreational drugs and activities are banned, but smoking cigarettes and other other drugs smoking cigarettes particularly is not banned, we think that this is why a signaling sends a signaling effect to people in society that this is something that is acceptable, when really it's only going to be harmful to you.
Further, we think it's the job of government to protect its people.
We think that because there's a strong signal in the fact that a ban sets, and because it makes it simply more difficult to get cigarettes, we think that the ban will likely be effective in reducing the amount of people that smoke.
It may be harmful on those that smoke now to make it more difficult to force them to quit smoking, but we think we need to think of the long-term health ramifications of our country and of all people.
To allow smoking allows more people to be normalized to the idea of smoking.
It allows more parents to continue to show children the practice of smoking, for people to see it in media, all these things.
When you see these things and you become normalized to the idea of smoking, you're just far more likely to choose to smoke in the future or to try smoking and from there, think that it's okay.
Because of this, we think that the government, knowing that this is a almost entirely harmful act, there's no real redeeming quality, the expression of freedom that you do when you choose to smoke is only an expression of freedom that is ultimately going to hinder all of your other rights, your health, your right to life, your right to travel, all these things are hindered when you take this obviously free choice to smoke.
We don't think that this is a valid choice to make.
We don't think that this is a good choice to allow people to have.
And maybe it restricts rights to an extent, but we think that that's okay given the overwhelming health benefits that occur when people choose not to smoke, when people do not become infatuated or even normalized to the possibility of smoking, and when you ban smoking, you do that.
And that's why we should ban smoking."
"We should subsidize public service broadcasting.
Public service broadcasting allows individuals who would otherwise be denied information which is essential to democracy a way to access it incredibly easily through a variety of mediums including radio, podcasts and television.
Public service broadcasting provides information which is sorely needed in the modern day.
Because we think a variety of individuals are using lies and misinformation to their own political ends, we would say that public service broadcasting must be funded in the status quo.
With that in mind, we would support the following model that the united states should massively increase its funding towards public service broadcasting, increasing the total number of channels available, and increasing the total number of viewpoints expressed on those channels.
With that in mind, we have two arguments.
First, on government obligation and second, on journalism's pragmatic value in the modern world.
So on government obligation first, we think that governments have an obligation to democracy.
Why is this the case?
Governments are necessarily a result of democracy.
The only reason they have power is the will of the people and the resources of the people.
Each politician owes a debt to the individuals who voted them into power, their constituency, and the whole amalgamation of government that is to say the legislature, the executive branch, judicial branch, the military, all of them gain their income gain their resources, gain their power, from the actual faith and trust put in into them by the people.
As such, we believe there's a reciprocal obligation from the government to the people to guarantee that democracy is facilitated.
However, democracy can only be successful in a world in which individuals are educated.
If I do not know the policy positions of politicians, if I don't know what they've done in the past, I cannot vote them into power with good conscience.
I can not check against them nor compare them to one another.
We say that there is a inherent right to education in this regard in that we must promote education, promote information, to all individuals.
We would also say that there's a pragmatic benefit to this.
When you can check against individual scandals, when you can check against certain policies going out to the people, we think that this necessarily leads away from fascism and leads away from oppressive policies that would otherwise go by unnoticed until their horrific effects are felt by the people.
Secondly though, we think government has an obligation to facilitate education.
This is because education is itself a facilitative right.
What we mean by this is that when an individual's educated, they have access to democracy but also they have access to a better quality of life.
They have access to more speech rights.
They have access to more privacy rights and they're more able to articulate themselves in the marketplace of ideas.
If government has any economic obligations it is then to develop the human capital of its citizens.
If it has any political or social obligations, it is to allow individuals to live the best life possible.
Education necessarily does this because it allows individuals to use the limited resources, time, money, energy, in the most efficacious way possible and to understand all of the options available to them.
This brings me to my second argument how journalism necessarily increases the total amount of information in the world.
This is because public service broadcasters employ huge numbers of individuals typically reporters and investigators who can discover the truth even when is it is attempted to be hidden.
We believe the effect of this then, the subsidy of these individuals will necessarily uncover more scandals meaning that there's less oppressive policies going through.
It will allow for individuals to actually check against oppressive politicians, but it will also deter individuals who'd otherwise oppress the public.
Not every individual who would capitalize upon a easy situation in which they can gain power is a bad person.
We necessarily think then that public service broadcasters much put must push them away from those situations in which individual individuals would attempt to seize power.
Furthermore, we think there is simply too little discourse in the status quo and that discourse is largely based on political and private incentives they would otherwise be avoided through public service broadcasting.
For this reason, we should subsidize public service broadcasting."
"We should fight urbanization.
By this we mean that countries, particularly developing countries, should introduce policies which discourage people from leaving rural areas to move to urban ones.
Three arguments for why we think this is the case.
The first is that we think that urbanization undermines traditional cultures.
Many people's religion, language, culture, and way of life are tied to the place that they live.
If they uproot themselves and move to the capital or another large city, we think that they're likely to lose that culture.
In other words, urbanization undermines the little differences that provide diversity to a country and force people to assimilate to one urban culture in order to succeed.
If you think about the philippines, there are many indigenous languages to this country.
It has a lot of diversity in that way.
But almost everybody who moves to major cities, like manila, ends up speaking tagalog, the national language.
So we see that other minority languages are going extinct, that people aren't continuing to practice their ancient customs, and that ultimately these ways of life are probably going to go away.
We think those things probably have aesthetic value and that diversity is a good in and of itself, but also we think it's unfortunate that the cultures that are being pushed on to people are often those that were put into place in urban areas by colonists, and that you see a continuing instance of more dominant cultures replacing subservient cultures, due to colonial relations.
Our second argument is about why we think the type of organization that's largely going on today is not desirable.
Most people moving to cities today are not moving to new york city or london.
They're moving to cities like karachi or jakarta.
And they're not living in the city center or the part that you see when we go visit from our nice western countries, they're moving into massive slums.
So these people move into areas that don't have a lot of social services, the quality of the housing is very poor and often unsafe.
There's no access to things like schools or public transit because these slums are often semi-illegal, because oftentimes people are discouraged from urbanizing and choose to move anyway, and therefore go into these slums.
So, we think that what ultimately this does is put people into a situation that's much worse than the one that they came from.
People think that they're going to move to the city and make it big and start a business but, ultimately, when they get there, they find out that that's impossible because the only place they can live are these slums.
So people are being lied to and ending up in terrible living conditions.
Some of the worst in the world are in cities like karachi or dhaka, where people just live in abject poverty, and there are no social services available to them.
Our last point is that we think that this leads to poor development.
So this is a big concern for developing countries, that if you have lots of urbanization, then it's very tempting to focus all of your wealth on making urban centers better, while letting rural centers lag behind.
We see that to some extent, this is a problem in india.
India, for instance, has separate minimum wages for urban and rural areas.
But what this means is that there is an increasing gap between people in urban areas, who have primary and some secondary education, and people out in the villages in what are sometimes called tribal areas, who have basically no education and no access to services.
And as the rate of urbanization increases, those rural people get left behind even more.
We tell you that ultimately this is unacceptable because even if those people in rural areas are a smaller proportion of the population, we're still talking about millions of people who are being left behind by development, who aren't reaping the benefits of society.
And we think that those people deserve an equal opportunity to benefit from society, that they're being denied if you have this organization, because all the development is going to end up concentrated in those cities.
So in order to prevent the entire world from looking like the gap between mumbai and the poorest regions of inner india, we should fight urbanization.
Thank you."
"We should subsidize public service broadcasters.
What we mean by public service broadcasters are any broadcasting organization that exists through public funds and exists simply to inform the public.
It isn't usually a large market company, it doesn't have entertainment value attached with it, it simply exists to inform and disseminate information to the public.
The other thing is that these subsidies wouldn't be contingent on any type of reporting or in any particular type of success of returns anything like that, so these would be unconditional subsidies to public service broadcasters.
Okay, two things in this debate.
The first is why me why money ultimately ends up corrupting other media sources, and secondly why we think we solve for that with this.
Okay so recognizing the status quo that the media is the most important means by which individuals are able to attain information.
And an informed public is essential for the functioning of a state.
In order to have any sort of rigorous elections in which politicians can be checked for things like corruption and inefficiency in order to ensure that public good is always being served in a way that ensures that it maximizes the public good in order to have an informed populace that can be aware of the variety of different things occurring in the world at any given time you need to have a media that is able to educate them.
The problem in the status quo is that most media organizations are owned by large conglomerates that have massive stakes in what the media is reporting.
What I mean by this is that when you have companies like CNN and fox and that are like groups that are owned by turner and other large broadcasting conglomerates, when you have so much money at stake in the system it means that the political ramifications of what you're reporting really matter to you.
Which means that there's a reason and an incentive to skew the information that's being presented in order to align political will of the populace with what matters to your media broadcasting organization.
Which is why we see a skew in political ideology in in media across the united states.
Which is why you have people that largely recognize that fox news is conservative and that MSNBC is incredibly liberal.
You have this skew.
The other reason why this skew exists is that money when you have a broadcasting network that exists to increase viewership and to get more and more ad revenue, you're less incentivized to report what's true and what's important because oftentimes these important things aren't that entertaining and aren't that outrageous and don't attract views.
For example the average bill that makes it through congress for a local state house simply isn't going to have massive implications that are going to get people riled up and get people to tune in to your show, which means that you're incentivized to only report the most outrageous, outlandish and most attractive news stories for audiences which doesn't mean that you're necessarily going to get an informed public, it just means that you're going to make the most money.
And this isn't because these people that run these organizations are bad, it's because that's what they're dictated to do by the free market in order to maintain their business, in order to maintain their market share, they need to maintain viewership.
We think we solved for this with public service broadcasters.
Public service broadcasters aren't invested in these big political ideas in the same way that big media corporations are.
They don't have as much of an investment on whether or not we regulate the media too a high extent or how we're going to tax the richest people in the country.
And because viewership doesn't determine their funding, but rather the subsidies would, they can report on incredibly important yet not very sexy ideas like what's going on in the next big tax proposal, or what's going on in the budget, or things like this, that don't attract viewership because they just aren't things that you can simplify into a sound bite and then have people talk about on loop for twenty four hours.
But they require real in depth analysis and understanding that maybe technical and maybe pouring boring but we think is ultimately crucial to an educated society and crucial to the functioning of our society.
And more importantly there's no trade off with giving subsidies to public service broadcasters and other media organizations.
So we don't think it's an interference in the free market we just think that by subsidizing public service broadcasters, you're likely to have a more informed electorate and an option that people can turn to that doesn't just feed them the most scandalous news but is ensuring them that they get the most important news.
And for this reason we should subsidize public service broadcasters."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should increase drug testing.
We're gonna model this pretty broadly, we think that would be positive if on net we increased drug testing in all of the current fields that we have them.
We're fine with adding additional drug tests like we think that drugs are illegal and we ought be enforcing it essentially.
So three main areas of clash, first on why the good is idiosyncratic and the only way in which we can actually enforce any kind of good or determine any kind of good is by laws and customs and first on how the good is idiosyncratic.
Recognize that it is just like true that though our definition of the good and how individuals define the good is different depending on who you talk to.
Like maybe I'm a vegetarian and I really believe in protecting animals but like other people might not be and so we think that what happens is that we aggregate what individuals believe is the good and that's why maybe we don't have laws that prohibit the eating of animals because the majority of individuals don't see that as an automatic good.
And so we think that like once you have laws that determine that good based on their aggregation and based on the majority then you have to enforce them otherwise you just end up this like discriminatory law that enforces depending on individual status and circumstance which is necessarily unjust.
And so we think that like this denies individuals equality underneath the law but also prevents that law from having legitimacy insofar as it isn't something that is like truly consistent within that society and allows individuals to think that like maybe they'll be lucky enough to slip out from under it and then punish punishes individuals who just happened to not be lucky while other people got away.
But our second area of clash is about why we think that that would be harming cartels and why that's really really good because recognize that as long as illegal selling occurs we need to punish consumption because punishing selling only gets us so far insofar as if they're still consumer base and people want to buy all this means is that sellers raise their prices and go deeper underground or like maybe have like slightly less stock make it really really expensive because they know that people are going to buy it either way.
The only way that you decrease the that you actually hurt sellers and like have a chance of eliminating cartels is when you decrease demand by increasing the associated risk.
So if no one wants your drug you have to lower your prices a lot and oftentimes this makes it not worth the risk of selling it like not worth the fact that you're putting yourself at risk and your family at risk and like not earning that much off of it and like maybe it's really expensive to produce and things like that.
And so we think that when people are much more likely are afraid of getting caught afraid of getting punished in circumstances they usually wouldn't be they're way less likely to purchase it.
Like it's really easy for college students to buy marijuana or like start harder drugs like cocaine because we think that marijuana is probably fine but like things like heroin meth etcetra aren't when they know they're insulated by this intellectual bubble that administrators aren't going to puncture like we think that only once people don't feel protected is when they stop consuming and when they stop consuming is when we can actually like access cartels.
And recognize that cartels are really really bad because they're the ones that are actually propagating gang violence in like local areas that like sell that like grow these kind of drugs and we prefer a world in which they just didn't exist given like the associated crime rates.
Our third area of clash is about pushing for drug legislation because recognize that there are good and bad drugs ie it's probably worse when people are addicted to meth than when they occasionally smoke marijuana and we think the problem right now is that the law doesn't differentiate between drug classes because we just painted them all with the same broad brush and then since people know that the law can be lenient with specific drugs they don't care enough to actually like create political will to change that law because they're just like oh no one's going to get caught with it anyway but the problem is that a lot of people still do get persecuted with things like marijuana because it's a way to justify our ingrown racism and so we think that once you have middle class white people going to jail it's much more likely to to like get like political will and get political efficacy and like maybe making marijuana legal but maintaining heroin's illegality.
Proud to propose."
"We should subsidize distance education.
So, just to explain what this debate is about, distance education is usually a form of tertiary or university level education in which students are not present directly on a college campus.
So in other words, if you were taking a degree in math, you might go to a campus in a city near you twice a year to take exams, but otherwise you would watch lectures online and submit your problem sets over the internet so that a grader at the university could grade them.
So people would graduate with accredited degrees from respectable universities, the same universities that they might attend now in person, but they would be able to do all of this from a distance.
So with that in mind, we have three arguments for our case today.
The first is about a broader reach.
Necessarily, there's limited space at a given university.
I'm right now on the campus of the university of california at los angeles, and it's a huge university in the middle of an enormous city, one of the largest in the world.
But even so, there are so many people in los angeles who can't attend the school because there just isn't space for millions of people or hundreds of thousands of people to attend any one campus.
Even some of the largest schools in the world, like the university of toronto, still can't serve everyone in their metropolitan area, simply because there are too many people in a large city who need to go to school.
And that's to say nothing of rural people, who don't live near the kind of school that they'd like to attend or any suitable school at all.
So on our side, we can reach more people with less space.
People can sit in their apartment and learn and watch lectures and read, and then only travel to campus to take exams, or maybe even get them proctored closer to home.
For instance, some schools would let you have a librarian or a priest or another respected authority figure proctor your exam, so you don't have to go to the university at all.
So with that in mind, we should subsidize distance education so that people have access to a quality of education, no matter how crowded their local university is or no matter how close they live to a university.
Our second argument is about nontraditional students.
More and more people today change their career at a later age in life.
And if you're, say, a mother of two, you're forty years old, and you're deciding to get your college degree, you probably don't have the time to go to campus, even to take night classes.
Although obviously night classes are great for letting working people go to school, some people will never be able to have that structured block of time or, as I mentioned earlier, they may just not be able to access the university.
So these students, especially older students, are better able to get an education in our world, because they're able to take these classes online whenever it's convenient for them.
And as long as they get the work done, they can be guided at their own pace.
So we think that this is better, especially for adults returning to education, than having a more structured environment would be.
And our last point is that this allows more people to access elite instruction.
There's a popular online computer science class taught by a very well-regarded harvard professor.
So right now, only a few thousand people get to access the benefits of having a harvard professor, presumably one of the best people at teaching in his field.
And if there's a better instructor available at these schools, we, in our world, can offer it to everyone around the country.
So thousands of people can take this harvard online compsci class and learn about computer science from one of the best instructors in the country whereas without distance education, only a handful of harvard undergrads are able to benefit from this.
And when you subsidize distance education, there's more of an incentive for schools to have their star lecturers create these online courses than there is right now.
So in our world, we have a broader reach, we help nontraditional students, and we give everyone access to the best teachers.
For all of these reasons, we should subsidize distance education.
Thank you."
"We should introduce goal line technology.
So the type of technology we're talking about would be a technology that allows you to see whether a goal has been scored or not in soccer.
The way that you can check these things is that every time there is a goal or every time there is a supposed goal you would have a brief stoppage time where, in most cases there already is some stoppage time, and there would be a quick review from not a line ref but rather from someone in a booth in the stadium another ref on the refereeing team who would say whether or not the goal went through, confirm the results.
Alright so we think that the main benefit that we derive is that we get more accurate results.
So we're going to explain why that's the case and why that's important.
So, why is it the case that you get more accurate results?
Because we think it's clear that using modern technology to update an old game is a way to insure that we get the most vision on what actually incurs.
It insures that all goals are accurate.
It's not difficult to tell whether or not a goal crossed a line when you have two cameras pointed at that line that can zoom in on exactly whether or not someone stopped the ball before it went across that line.
It's not a very difficult thing to do, but in in the moment, when someone is watching this thing fold out live and they can't slow it down on a camera, human error is entirely possible and does happen all the time.
We think that that human error is taken out entirely from the score as any sort of potential.
So why should I even care about accuracy in a soccer game?
Well firstly, we would say that the sport exists only because fans feed into it.
They give their time, they give their money and they give their emotion to the sport and specifically to the team they root for.
Fans care that when their team goes out to compete that the game and not human error decide the result.
They want to know that when they're watching a game that if their team competes the hardest, if they do the best and if they go out there they're going to be rewarded with a win and that that win won't just be taken away from them because some person because some referee accidentally called a goal when a goal was not scored or the opposite, didn't score a goal for the team that a fan is rooting for when it should have gone in.
What is the impact of this?
Firstly, we think you increase the overall interest for the game when you know that there's more confidence in the results and there's more money for the game which means that you are able to spread it more, you're able to pay the players better, you're able to get more returns for owners, all types of things.
Yes, this is probably a marginal gain compared to the status quo but we think it's a gain nonetheless and that's something that should be highlighted.
We also think that the purpose of the sport is to raise as like as like an ethereal thing is to raise athletic excellence in competition to the highest level.
We think that guaranteeing accuracy of results allows that focus to be on sport and that that focus to be on the competition rather than the decision of a referee and oftentimes when a referee makes a bad decision all the attention is put on that decision, the media attention, the fan attention is all directed there which we think is a bad reflection of the sport itself.
So, finally will this disrupt the game?
No.
A stoppage occurs after a score anyway and the vast majority of cases are open and shut.
Most of the time, when a when a goal is scored that ball goes to the back of the goal and it's incredibly obvious that this has been a goal.
But when the review does take time, so in the few instances where it may take some time, we think that these is these are likely to be very little amounts of time but more importantly they're likely to occur in instances where the wrong call would be the most impactful in a big game, in a championship game, in a close game, in a rivalry game.
These are types of times in which taking the time to ensure that you have accuracy in your results have the most impact and these are the times when you may get some disruption but we think it's massively outweighed from all of the benefits that we already talked about earlier.
For these reasons we should introduce goal line technology."
"We should protect snowden.
We would mean the US government, what we mean by protect is that we would offer him free return to the united states without any kind of threat of legislation against him or any criminal record, and we would like presumably offer him with some form of like security to make sure that nobody else is able to harm him as well.
Three main areas of clash, or two main areas of clash.
First on the importance of whistleblowers.
Recognize that whistleblowers are one of the only ways of maintaining an informed democracy.
This is because the government always has an incentive to be secretive, insofar as they often have different incentives, such as staying in power or maintaining security of a personal privacy, than maybe the common voter would.
But we think that the population has a right to know either way, because this is something that directly impacts them, because it is a government acting that they elected into office, because the government is meant to represent them, and when the government is not acting in that way they need to be able to have a way to counteract that.
But you can never counteract that or act as a check on the government unless you have the information in the first place.
So we think that whistleblowers serve as a really important method or tool by which we obtain information the government would never provide us with of their own volition.
We also think that it serves as a certain kind of deterrence on the government.
Insofar as the government understand that there's always a risk to leak information, always a risk that they might get in trouble for what they are doing, they are infinitely less likely to do the kind of bad things that we really dislike, like shitty surveillance or like data collection that might be really pernicious.
And so we think that what happens is every time there is a new whistleblower, it reaffirms to the government that they are not doing something that is good, but also that they cannot guarantee getting away with this in the future, so it disincentivizes that action.
Our second area of clash is about preventing bad whistleblowing.
Because recognize that there are different ways to blow the whistle, you can do it in ways that are generally not dangerous.
In these situations you don't release the material that would put active members in danger, you would go through a reputable source that would've fact checked you and checked the security issues, or you can do it in the way that is dangerous, which is info dumping on wikileaks, like doing everything really quickly through non-reputable sources.
So when there's a crackdown on whistleblowing, whistleblowers still exist.
They just info dump in more dangerous ways to protect themselves, so they'll travel to the other country first and then be like "" wikileaks, you'll take my information even if new york times no longer will, how about I just leave everything here? ""
.
This is really bad because it puts actual people in a lot of danger.
IE, if edward snowden's material had contained the locations of active members in the way that chelsea manning's did, then this would mean that those active members were likely to get killed or suffer, or it would put in danger future government operations.
And so we think that it becomes really really important to deter poor whistleblowing, and the only way in which you do this is by providing less severe punishment to those who do it right.
And it's really important to independently have a legal designation of good versus bad whistleblowing for other reasons too, and that lumping them together means they take less care of how they distribute info, but also it means that other countries don't know how to distinguish between who can they protect versus not.
So a lot of countries protect whistleblowers and will take whistleblowers who are coming from the united states, but if they're able to see that that whistleblower put people in danger, did it wrong versus right, we think we'd get more cooperation.
There's also just less political efficacy to spend when you are trying to persecute or prosecute every single whistleblower, rather than just the ones who are the worst.
Like recognize that edward snowden did everything right, he went to the new york times, he didn't release any like specific private data, like this was possibly done in one of the most correct situations because it had to do with privacy rights.
Insofar as all of those boxes are checked, we think he ought be protected.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish open primaries.
What we would do instead are the alternative which are technically closed primaries in which individual parties have run-off elections before they select the final person who will go on to be the candidate in the general election.
Three main arguments first on why it is less democratic.
In the case of open primaries, the party has to choose the candidate before the open primaries because there's no time to give physical support if everything is open.
Right like we think that currently the way that it works is that parties have the entirety of closed primary set aside and see what the people's opinion is on who the most qualified candidate is.
Then once they have that official candidate democratically elected they shoot them they put all of this money, all of this advertising, all of this political support behind them and send them up the ladder to the general election.
But the difference is that it occurs after the people have already spoken.
When you go straight to the general election like using using open primaries without this little preliminary amount of time, you don't ever take into account the individual vote and individual populations which means you're effectively skewing the public the point that you're saying this is who the party endorses either way now your choice is to support him or to not.
It also means that they get a lot more conflicting rhetoric on this individual insofar as during closed primaries parties can say can explain why they think that certain candidates might be less qualified.
However, once they're chosen parties can't say the negatives anymore and so it is much more likely that individuals are going to be receiving a much more skewed version of that candidate in the first place.
We think that fundamentally, individuals deserve to be selecting their candidate at every step of the process.
That it's a problem if you're allowing the the political parties so much influence without any kind of say from the people who are actually going to be living under this person's rule more off.
We prefer for the people to be able to speak first then the party can talk.
Our second area of clash is why open primaries discourage many candidates running.
In a bipartisan system every candidate in a like given to a certain party and going into the general election representing a certain party, represents a split in the vote.
It means the parties will purposefully discourage them because they don't want to split the population between.
Imagine a world in which hillary clinton and bernie sanders ran side by side and because so many democrats supported bernie they would have this massive split vote that would prevent hillary from ever getting a majority.
Even though like in this counter factual donald trump would certainly have the win insofar as the democrats had divided their vote between two candidates but the republicans were were like solidly only behind one.
In fact, the funny part is that this is exactly the reason that bernie didn't run as an independent.
We think that political parties recognize the incentive structures and recognize the institutional structures that will influence who wins at the end and given that no one likes to lose it is incredibly likely that they will discourage any other candidates from running regardless of whether or not they might be a better idea based on the majority decisions of their own party.
It means you never get a chance for an independent or any kind of or anyone who isn't someone from the majority party to win an election or even someone who might be a minor candidate from the majority party to win an election.
We think that all of these candidates deserve an equal chance rather than just someone who seems to be the most optically preferred having the largest chance in in being pushed straight to the straight to the open primary.
At least in the closed primary system we give minority candidates a chance to show their party that they're capable of riling in the votes.
Our third area of clash branches off of this and that it's about destroying the multi-party system.
Given that only two people can run in the general election in a in an open party system, then at most you're going to have two parties ever being represented regardless of which two parties they are.
This is most impactful at the state level where it's actually quite common for independents to run and often win in open in close primaries but now you can't because independent parties depend on three on on the like on the potential of three candidates.
While the main parties are never going to give up their power slots to lower ones so it will always be republican versus democrat.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"A global language is advantageous.
Like the story of the tower of babylon, languages can set people apart and create artificial barriers between different groups.
We think that in a world in which everyone speak english for example, is a world that's much more inter-connected in which wars become less likely, in which it is much harder for rich countries to take advantage of or at least ignore the plight of poorer countries in which businesses can blossom.
Opposition are going to try and talk about the importance of language to the collective particular unique identity of peoples.
Let's help them understand exactly what their burdens are in this debate.
A, they're going to have to show you why it's necessarily mutually exclusive.
Why if there is a global language that everyone can understand this necessarily means the extinction completely of all other languages that are so deeply rooted in the cultures and the lives of people all around the world.
This is a very hard burden because in many parts around the world today it is already the fact of the situation that english is being used as an international language and everyone studies it from a young age and that's the you know, the language of business and so on and it doesn't come at the expense of the original mother tongue.
Look at me I debate in english with a bunch of americans and I still think and dream in hebrew.
I don't feel that this affects my identity.
B, even if they're successful in explaining why one comes at the expense of the other they're going to have to clarify why is it that a language is a necessary condition to the formation of a particular identity?
Why in a world in which everyone speaks english, by the way, in which in all likelihood there's going to be slightly different dialects and accents in different areas, why can't there be still cultural ingredients like other cultural ingredients that will provide the exact same feeling of collective identity that side opposition want to preserve so much?
Let's look at what's happening in the anglo sphere countries england, the united states, canada, australia, ireland, new zealand.
Does opposition really think that those countries don't have a particular identity in the unique culture in which the citizens can take pride in?
This is just factually not not what's happening, and c lastly, even if they are some somehow magically successful in explaining why is it that people are going to lose their unique sense of identity they still would have to weigh this and explain why on earth is it more important than all of the advantages that we get from a global language?
In that I will explain right away.
So my mother's tongue has been determined quite randomly as like as a as a result of the place to to which I was born.
It doesn't say anything about me as an individual, no more than the color of my skin, or my nationality, and yet just like skin color and nationality language is being used as a tool that is very convenient in order to separate the world and divide it into different categories of people, and it's very easy for people to determine according to language who is in their camp and who is different from them.
These divisions also defines who I'm going to sympathize with and feel a shared sense if destiny with, and because this is random we think that this division is completely false.
We think that it's not rational that I will identify and feel associated with a person that thinks not like me on every subject and matter, and don't feel associated with the person that does share my beliefs and values just because the former speaks my language and the latter doesn't, and also more important than that we think that this division also determines who I can easily ignore in the best case and outright dislike in the worst case, and we think that it's too easy today for populistic leaders to convince their citizens that the citizens of another country is their are there enemies.
It's too easy for israelis to hate palestinians or iranians and the opposite.
It's too easy for americans to hate the russians and the opposite.
We think that this has become easy because the language barrier and the differences like cultural differences that result from it are too grave in order for common people to just start talking one to one another in like in a direct way, and see that they're not so different from one another.
We think this is also makes like this also makes it too easy to forget what's happening in countries like africa and in countries countries in southeast asia because they're not like us.
We think that a world with a global language helps to solve all of these things.
Therefore we're proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban international adoption.
For the purposes of this round, we're going to say that we, as the united states government.
With that, three main areas of clash.
The first on government obligation.
We think that the government has obligations to its citizens first, primarily because these are the people that they have promised to protect.
They live underneath a imaginary, of sorts, social contract, in which they pay taxes in, so the government protects them.
They give certain rights up to the government, and so the government is willing to use those rights to keep them safe, secure, and like fulfill whatever rights are dictated by that country's constitution.
The important thing to remember is that, even this imaginary contract applies only between the states and its citizens, because, in the end, the citizens of russia are not paying the US government.
They aren't giving up their rights to the US government, they're giving it up to that of russia.
What this means is that the hierarchy of obligation is always going to be towards the citizens that you directly handle, because the other citizens don't have any ties to your government.
More than this, we think we see this as an acceptable policy in the majority of current country situations.
It's important to note, that the that that every time there is a question between saving one of your citizens, or saving multiple of the citizens of another country, countries choose their own citizens.
Because, not only is this a unspoken contract, it is also an acceptable global law.
So, we think what's important to note is that the the united states foster system, an orphan system, is incredibly bad.
Not only is it underfunded and overstressed, but the numbers of children within it are rising, but their capabilities haven't increased.
What this means is that more than ever, you're seeing children placed with incompetent foster families.
You're seeing lack of resources, and you're seeing them fall through the cracks.
We think as long as there are children within the united states in need of a of a home, it it is a failure of the government to allow families, to go elsewhere to look for children to adopt.
It is in the same way that we are going to take care of our own citizens first, if they are in a tricky situations abroad, we must take care of our own citizens first, when we are within our own borders, and make sure they are not threatened by the adoption of those abroad.
More than this though, we think that the situation is getting worse and worse with regards to adoption in the united states, in part because it it is often bypassed for families to go abroad and look for children.
We think, that once the united states sends a clear message of: this is unacceptable, you're going to see much more resources put into the united states system.
Our second main area of class hostage with why we think they contribute to exploitative systems abroad.
We think, a lot of the time, young american couples, like young white children and often like to hand pick the baby that they adopt from abroad.
What this means is that young women are often pressured into giving up their children, when they fit a certain kind of look, or a certain kind of characteristics, with very little compensation.
We think that if it was a regulatable market, rather than just adoption, this would be a different story.
But because this is adoption, you oftentimes get situations, in which women women are offered money under the table, and feel like they have to give their child up.
More than this, we think that a lot of the time these things have gotten out of control, and you see child trafficking, specifically to get children adopted into the united states, because it is seen as a profitable business.
Our third main area of clash has to do with why it contributes to a loss of culture, because we think that what you're doing, in these situations, is taking children from other countries and oftentimes adopting them to white families.
We saw we see these sights all the time, where currently adoption from south korea is incredibly popular, a few years back adoption from africa was incredibly popular, and it was usually white couples that would take them in and give them a good home.
But the problem is that this home came along with the with no exposure to the cultures from which they came.
We think this is problematic, because what essentially what happened is that these cultures died with the children that were adopted, and they never actually got any like choice in the matter.
We think these children ought be able to consent into what world that they live in, and the only way, in which this can happen, is if they're exposed to their native culture first in their own homeland.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should abandon social media1.
By this, we mean that we think that society should move away from using websites like twitter, facebook, and reddit, and back to more traditional forms of communication and sharing information.
Three arguments for why this is the case.
First, we think that social media, although it claims to bring people together, actually leads to alienation of people.
Why is this so?
So, on social media, you see a carefully curated version of a person's life, and we think that ultimately this doesn't reflect any bearing in reality.
For instance, you say you're just graduating from college, and you see that your friend is going on a vacation to hong kong, and your other friend has just gotten a new job, and your cousin is getting married, ultimately we think it's quite likely that you're going to compare ordinary moments in your life to the highlights in other people's lives.
We think that this leads to people feeling depressed, and dissatisfied, with their own experiences, even if they're actually doing okay, because people don't share average moments on facebook or instagram, they only share the highlights.
So, we think that ultimately social media makes its users unhappy.
Our second argument for why it should be abandoned, and perhaps the most important, is the loss of privacy and the implications thereof.
So, realize that organizations like facebook collect huge amounts of data every year, and then sell it to various different purchasers.
In other words, if you're not the buyer, you're the product.
Things like facebook are free, because they sell your data to other companies.
Why does this matter?
First of all, we think that people's privacy is being undermined without their understanding of what's going on.
People don't realize that facebook is selling their data to other companies, which then use it to influence them into purchasing things they don't want or need, or otherwise making them do things that they wouldn't like to do.
But aside from that, we also think that it undermines other people's freedoms and privacy, besides the person making the posts.
For instance, think about how many post you've seen of your friends' children.
It's quite likely that those children are going to grow up one day, and all of those photos and videos of them doing things that are maybe cute as a baby, but also embarrassing, will still be online.
At that point, we think it's quite likely that these people's right to privacy is being violated, without their consent, because of social media.
But on top of that, we tell you that governments are able to take advantage of this information in a tremendously powerful way.
We see, for instance, that in many repressive regimes around the world, they either ban western social media, and set up copies of it that collect all the information for them, or pressure companies like google into giving personal information about who is reading what books, who's talking to whom, to the government, and in this way they're able to track movements, and go after dissidents, and this doesn't even have to be something like the PRC rounding up people who are against the communist party, it can be something, like in the united states, government collecting meta data from facebook to determine people who are at risk of joining certain organizations, and then targeting them unfairly with things like the no fly list.
Our third argument, for why we should abandon social media, is about how it leads to greater radicalism, and otherwise harmful effects on young people.
We see that things like twitter had been tremendously important for terrorist groups to recruit new members, especially in the west.
Without twitter and social media, it seems very unlikely that there would have been an isis related killing in san bernardino california, for instance.
We tell you that, because social media creates echo chambers, where people only see the content they want to see, it's a sort of curated garden of content, this means that people don't ever actually confront the shortcomings of ideologies and ideas, that appeal to them on a surface level.
Movements like the alt right are completely dependent on this echo chamber to radicalize young people, who don't have the breadth of knowledge, or scope of view, to see what's going on.
So we think that it should be abandoned as well, because of its role in radicalizing people.
For these reasons, we should abandon social media.
Thank you."
"I am proud to propose the motion that we should ban hunting.
Our first independent point is animal rights.
So we think that animal rights exist for two reasons: first is that the standards for determining like who has rights and who doesn't that just favor humans only having rights are generally arbitrary in nature.
So for example like the most frequently cited one is like: "" oh, well humans are more intelligent "", but like we're totally fine with being like: "" yes like a one day old baby has rights but like an elephant doesn't "".
And we think that if you're doing that calculation just based on what the raw intelligence of the being is, like elephants are clearly smarter than a newborn infant.
At that point then, we think that this is an arbitrary standard.
But secondly we think that animal rights exist simply because we believe that rights come from having preferences.
So what we mean by this is that like scales and like first order versus second order thinking shouldn't matter.
That just if you are capable of suffering and like experiencing pain and can demonstrate that you don't want to experience that pain, then there is no need to force you to experience that pain.
Like, if you like, I don't know like for some reason we're just like fine with the fact that like: "" oh, well yeah, like prodding a cattle with a hot iron for no reason is probably bad, but like also you can kill it and that's a reasonable trade off for like humans enjoying the taste of the meat. ""
So the impacts calculus there is nonsense.
Like at the end of the day if we are comfortable saying like suffering for the sake of suffering is bad, then we think that the impact calculus almost -ly favors protecting animals rights.
We think that hunting is harmful to animals in two ways: first is just that like in a vacuum, murder is bad.
Like we think that things have a right to life that that is facilitative to any other preference that they might have, and especially for beings that act on instinct, this is basically the only preference they have, so it makes sense to protect it.
But let's say you're of the opinion that animals don't care and as long as they're killed painlessly it's fine.
We still think the process of hunting is necessarily problematic.
Because animals, usually before they are killed, are aware that they're being hunted.
And there really isn't a way to create a regulatory structure that only bans hunting in instances where the animals don't know they're being hunted.
At that point then, we think that the psychological trauma intrinsic to the animal that is experiencing it is significantly more of a harm than whatever benefit the hunter derives from like the thrill of the game or whatever.
At that point then we think that this is an impact calculus that favors the ban.
Our second independent point is biodiversity.
So we believe that there are plenty of instances throughout history of rampant hunting leading to the rapid extermination of native populations.
Like we now have more regulations on like hunting seasons and things like that to ensure that this doesn't happen, but it is still a difficult line to walk because you are often capable of figuring out how many like animals hunters are going to kill in a given season.
And that fluctuation can result in serious harms on the broader ecosystem that you're looking at.
So let's say like too many deer are killed in one season in a particular region then the animals that relied on those deer for food like say, I don't know, mountain lions or something, are go into dwindle.
And we think that this is something that then ripples throughout the ecosystem, that the balance of different plant and animal wise fall out of whack and as a result we wind up with a permanently harmed like ecosystem.
Our third and final independent point is that hunting increases gun availability.
We think that the only pretense that like pro gun groups are really operating on right now is that people can have guns for hunting.
This is a silly pretense because hunting is way less important than just like murder and like gun violence in general, but we think that if you ban hunting for otherwise reasonable reasons then you get the added benefit of just having a pretense to say: "" okay yes so we can like stop selling guns to legal markets now "" right?
Because there is literally no reason to do it after you abolish hunting.
At that point then, we think that you can significantly curtail gun violence by decreasing the availability of guns.
Proud to propose."
"Tibetan independence is justified.
So, before we start this debate, we want to lay out the context in which tibet has existed and has been ruled over the past.
Recognize that, tibet did not ask to join china, it doesn't have particularly deep cultural ties to china, in fact it was largely autonomous and independent from both india and china, for the vast majority of its history.
It was self governing, and an autonomous region that existed, and what happened was china invaded, it forced all the culture out, by forcing out major religious and political leaders, such as the dalai lama, and it did this without the consent of the people there.
So, given that background, and given that context, we think that there are two reasons why the independence is justified: the first is that, we think there is a right to self rule, that has been clearly violated in this instance, and secondly, we think that china simply provides for bad governance.
So firstly, on the right to self rule.
We think that governments cannot be legitimate without the consent of the people that they rule.
The first reason for this is that, the people determine what the good is, and when the government refuses to abide by what the good is, by not allowing the people to have the self rule, by not allowing people to have self rule it's impossible for the government to fulfill that good, because it is intrinsic, in the people's ability to choose their leaders, that the good be determined.
But more importantly, we think that people have a right to determine the people that are going to have the course of the apparatus, and the capabilities of using force against them.
We think that the state is an immensely powerful body, and we think, without the consent of the people that are governed, it isn't any distinguishable from say, a cartel that rules over a region, or another organization that simply rules by force.
It makes the state, by its very nature, unjust, even if the state is doing good, it's still unjust, because people have no consent, we'd say that there is no purpose to this government, if it undermines what the people have, and tibet has shown throughout its history that it's capable of self governance.
It's capable of being able to rule itself autonomously, so it's not like china has come in and taken over an otherwise anarchic or anarchical state, that wasn't able to function properly without its rule.
In fact, we would say that china has made the region more problematic, more turbulent, and has provided bad government.
We think that governance needs to respect the desire of the people, and china has repeatedly shown an inability to do that.
Firstly they've imported han individuals to homogenize the region to make it more similar to china, and they forced people into these areas, which of course these are people that are privileged, and being able to have economic economic help and resources, provided to them by the chinese state.
These are the people that are able to get the most economic resources, and more importantly, it's homogenized the region in a way that has mixed a culture in, that wasn't otherwise welcome.
They removed the dalai lama, which was not only the political leader of this region, but the cultural and spiritual leader of this region, of the religion of these people, a central figure in the life of many tibetans, and this person has been forcibly removed, and been forced into exile from the state for decades now.
Given that this is the case, china has simply undermined the well being of the people, they've imposed their rule onto it, and we think there's been slower growth and modernization, than there has been in the rest of china, which shows that china has disproportionately stripped tibet of the resources that they provided to other people.
So, they're not even treating tibet as a region that is fully a part of china, they're treating it as a second class state, full of second class citizens.
We think, in the fact that it have stripped the people of tibet, of their culture, it has stripped the people of tibet of their religion, in a very meaningful way, that impacts their ability to self actualize, and live fulfilling lives, we think that china has failed, as a governing power of tibet.
So, even if their occupation and their takeover in its nature was justified, because they haven't fulfilled the will of the people, they haven't provided equal economic mobility and opportunity, and they haven't allowed the culture to flourish, in such a way that allows for people to be fulfilled outside of economic means, we think that all of this means that tibetan independence is justified."
"We should abolish personality tests.
So, by this we mean we should ban the use of these personality tests in any form, particularly for hiring or government or educational use, but we think that the place where they're most commonly used in the status quo would be in hiring.
And by personality test, we mean things like myers briggs test that claim to analyze your personality based on a short questionnaire and determine what type of person you're going to be and then oftentimes, employers will only hire people who receive a certain results because they think that they'll be better workers or that other people might be unreliable or otherwise undesirable because of their personality test.
Now, there's some amount of psychological support from the scientific community for the use of these tests to determine what type of person someone is, but we're going to give you two arguments for why we don't think they ought be used: so, our first point is that we think that these tests are unfair to the test taker in the hiring process.
We think, first of all, that they require you to reveal personal details that your employer otherwise couldn't ask for about you.
We think that your employer couldn't ask you, for instance, if you were the type of person who would want children or if you were the type of person who would want to get married and things like that, but that these questions might very well be included in the personality test and so, indirectly you're giving your employer access to information that they might not be permitted to ask for in another situation.
So, we don't think that the employer ought be allowed to do that.
We think it's unfair to the person applying.
We also think that these tests don't affect your ability at your job.
It might be possible that a person might have a myers personality type that's not traditionally associated with being a good lawyer, say, but that this individual happens to be a very good lawyer despite having a certain myers personality type.
We think that it's unfair to someone who has put in a lot of work to cultivate skills and to get an education and otherwise to build themselves up for a given career, to rule them out of it based not on their merits, but based only on their personality type.
Aside from that, we tell you that personality type may very well very from day to day and not be representative.
It's possible that on a given day, someone feels more introverted or more extroverted or that a person feels more positive or more negative.
We think particularly in the interview process when people are under a great deal of stress, it's likely that they'll act differently than they would if they weren't under that kind of stress and that ultimately, therefore, these tests are not representative of that person's true nature, even if the outcome of the test is actually representative of who they would be normally.
They're just not in a scenario where they're able to take that test fairly.
And if these results are legitimate, then we don't think they're something that an individual can control.
I didn't choose my myers type, so we shouldn't discriminate against people based on it, in the way that we don't discriminate against people based on other things that are, largely speaking, out of their control, such as race or sex or gender.
Our second argument is about why we think the use of these tests is actually harmful for employers: first of all, false negatives are likely to screen out good candidates.
So, if you don't want to hire people of x personality type and someone happens to be get the result of x, even if that's not really their personality type and they were a really good candidate for the job, then you're screening out someone who would've been the best employee, simply because the tests aren't perfectly accurate.
We also think that the outcome of using these personality tests will be that you'll hire less talented people who did well on a certain test.
So now, suddenly, you're screening people not based on how good a lawyer they are, but by what their myers type is and we don't think that always corresponds one-to-one with being a good lawyer the same way that things like records and skills do.
We think moreover, that you're likely to end up with one type of thinker if you screen out other personality types.
If you only look for one or two myers types that you hire, then you're going to exclude people who think differently and this might make you less innovative and less competitive than you would be if you had a more diverse group of people and personality-wise.
And we think that the big impact of all of this is that this damages your business compared to if you had hiring that was based only on recommendations and resumes and experience, like traditional hiring processes that's more focused on the actual job that the person would do.
So, for these reasons, we should abolish personality tests."
"Prohibit hydraulic fracturing, otherwise known as fracking.
We think that there are two main arguments to be made in this debate about why we should prohibit hydraulic fracturing.
The first is about global warming and why we think that global warming is the most important issue in the round and the decider right there, and the second is about economics and why fracking is not a cost-effective method of actually producing fuel.
So, firstly, on global warming.
We think that it cannot be overstated how crucial the argument about global warming is within this round.
Global warming is the reality that we face in our modern times, and the reality that is going to harm every civilization on earth if not addressed immediately.
In the immediate future, if we do not dramatically decrease the amount of fossil fuels we use as a civilization, as a human civilization, we are going to be face with tremendous changes to our environment that are going to drastically harm some every person on earth.
Let's explain what some of those harms are.
First and foremost, the increase in temperature globally leads to decreases leads to the melting of global ice polar ice caps, which leads to two really dramatic problems that come.
The first is that sea levels rise, which can cause flooding amongst coastal cities.
And while this may sound like an issue that is a niche issue, it's important to recognize that the majority of the human population lives on the coasts.
Major hubs of transportation, of civil activity, major hubs of society were developed on the coasts, because these are the areas that traditionally, and still today, are the most easy to transport goods to and from and the most easy to build up a society on, the easiest place to actually run a hub of civilization.
Which means that when the sea levels start rising globally, we can see major metropolitan areas, new york city, most countries in europe, especially low-laying countries like the netherlands, florida, major hubs of human activity in a population, all under water, which will cause huge loss of life, huge losses of property, and an immense downturn in the economy.
The other problem with rising sea levels is that these rising sea levels and the melting of global ice caps also come with warming waters, which means you're more likely to see, in the long run, dramatically worse storms and dramatically worse environmental damage that comes from those storms.
The damage that we've seen in recent years from hurricanes such as hurricane sandy and hurricanes like katrina are just a preview of what we can expect to see if we don't make dramatic changes right now.
Fracking adds to the burning of fossil fuels.
Aside from the damage that it does to the environment, and aside from the damage that it does just from getting those fuels out of the ground, it also increases the amount of fossil fuels that exists.
We think that this goes directly against what we need to do as a society in order to avoid the damages of global warming, and because global warming's such a huge threat, it outweighs any sort of issue that can be covered by by the economy or the gain or what have you, any arguments that the other side can make.
So, even if you don't care about that, we're also going to explain why we think economically it's just not a very good option.
Fracturing and fracking, as it's otherwise known, is just not a cost-effective method of trying to get fuel.
It requires you to destroy entire ecosystems and to pollute water supplies, all in the desire to try and get a little bit of fuel out of the ground.
It's an incredibly long process to get any sort of fuel that's usable, and the alternative is investing in other green industries, industries that are already growing today, industries that already have a firm foundation our economy and industries that are more likely to cause long-run stable jobs that we could otherwise being investing in.
Given that this is the case as far as an as far as economic terms are concerned, that fracturing is much worse economically and less viable economically in the long term than these other green technologies, we don't even think that it's a worthwhile economic investment, and on top of all of that, it only leads to more harms from global warming.
For these reasons, we should prohibit hydraulic fracturing."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should introduce year round school.
Or modeling this distinctly in the united states, given that we know that many other countries have already implemented this.
We think this would look something like three week breaks every two months, but you would consistently have school.
Like there wouldn't be a designated summer vacation that is multiple months long and so it would be as year round as possible.
Two main areas of clash: the first on why it's better for students.
First under this we want to talk about why students are infinitely less likely to forget things on our side of the house.
Because in the status quo there's this massive issue were students leave the school for three months and they stop reviewing stuff, and they stop learning new things.
And because they're not practicing they begin to forget all of the material that they've been building up through the course of the year.
And as such people go back to school and get like very jarred and very like shaken back into like the rest of their lives.
Right?
They have to spend weeks reviewing previous material, which is like wasted essentially, they struggle to get back because they've forgotten how to study or what they're studying.
And we think that a world in which we make it easier on students and reduce their stress is really good insofar as we've actually found a lot of long term studies that show that students who are more under stress do things like function less effectively, are more prone to getting sick in the future and things like that.
We also think that there's a certain argument here about preparation for the real world.
Insofar as the purpose of school is to take individuals completely unprepared to deal with reality and make them ones that can, we think that summer vacations fundamentally violate that purpose insofar as there are no summer vacations once you graduate and have a real job.
We think that school should mimic that, otherwise they're fundamentally underperforming in what they're designated to be doing by not preparing individuals for the real world.
Our second area of clash is about maximizing the efficiency of the school system and education.
Because recognize that the USA is massively falling behind other countries in primary school education.
Students are comparatively underperforming on most standardized tests in most areas that are deemed important.
Like we've been doing awfully in mouth for a very long time, like very fundamental areas.
And many other countries have already adopted these kinds of policies where it's been fully functional.
Like I'm pretty sure the netherlands and sweden are countries that have year round school, and the entire world hasn't collapsed yet.
We also think it's really important to note that having year round school keeps from wasting a lot of school resources that currently are.
Like at the point that a teacher has to do half a semester worth of review every time that students come back from summer vacation, we think that it's a lot of time wasted that wouldn't have to be wasted if you had a year round school.
Like it's a problem that at the beginning of every history class you have to go over like the most recent american history.
At the beginning of every social studies class you have to go over the fundamental workings of the court.
Like these are things that students should just know coming in and it wastes a lot of valuable time and a lot of valuable knowledge to have to review this every single time.
So we think that that's fundamentally inefficient and shouldn't be happening.
But more on the the but more than this, the fact that these buildings stay empty for months on end every time these people take break for the summer is really bad.
Right?
Like we think that it's more good when you're not just actively allowing school resources to lay around empty.
We also think there's an important argument here.
Like a lot of the time summer just means that parents have to find a way to occupy their kids.
And this is really difficult for anyone who has people parents who are working.
Or if you're a family in poverty who can't afford to just send your kid to a summer camp.
And so we think that providing children with unstructured free time that places the burden on parents to entertain them and make sure that they're not out like being hooligans, is really bad for the retention of individuals in trust and like safety and things like that.
And we think that school can serve as a meaningful structuring of time there given that parents shouldn't have to do that.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should abolish the antisocial behavior orders.
So these antisocial behavior orders are a facet of british law basically in which someone can be banned from doing a certain act that's causing trouble in the community.
So maybe if they're harassing somebody or if they're causing a lot of loud noise late at night things like that, one of these antisocial behavior orders can be issued by a civil court, which would then prevent the person from continuing that behavior and then if they breach that order it works a little bit like a restraining order in that there would be various penalties that would follow from that breach.
So with this in mind, we have two main arguments for why we should abolish these antisocial behavior orders.
The first is that criminal penalties ought not follow from civil court rulings.
What do we mean by this?
So britain is a common law country, which means that criminal law and civil law are conducted separately by separate courts.
So in a criminal court the balance of evidence is beyond the shadow of a doubt.
So you have to go completely beyond any reasonable doubt in order to convict someone in a criminal court, whereas in a civil court the balance of evidence is fifty percent.
So if you can prove that someone is fifty one percent likely to have been guilty then you can get them in a civil court.
So these antisocial behavior orders are issued by civil courts which means that the balance of evidence is fifty one percent for the whoever is bringing the charge, but these antisocial behavior orders also can carry criminal penalties.
People can run the risk of very serious financial penalties or long periods of public service etcetera if they violate these orders.
So what that means is that punishments which normally would have a very high standard of evidence to actually be carried out against somebody are now being carried out with a much lower standard of evidence.
We think that that is fundamentally unjust.
That when the court system was set up with this very high standard of evidence for criminal punishments, it's because these are very severe punishments and we need to be sure that people are actually guilty before we carry them out against them.
But these antisocial behavior orders essentially allow people to convict anybody that they think is probably guilty and then carry out the harshest punishments possible in british society.
At that point we think that it's very likely that many innocent people are going to suffer from these harsher penalties because the standard for proof is so low.
We think that this is fundamentally unjust, that it blurs the lines between criminal law and civil law and that therefore it ought to be abolished.
Our second argument is an argument against vagueness in the law.
We think that fundamentally these antisocial behavior orders can be construed to ban almost any sort of behavior and we don't think that you should have a law be this broad.
It's certainly true that we don't want people to harass one another but we already have laws against that in every country in the world including britain.
In the same way we see that it's probably not good for people to make lots of noise at certain times of day, but again lots of cities have municipal codes that prevent that.
We think that there are better ways to deal with the problems that these antisocial behavior orders address which are much clearer.
We think it's important that people understand what the law is before they can be charged with breaking the law.
It's very likely the case that everyone knows that what they're doing is wrong if they're going to run up against an antisocial behavior order, but whether something is right or wrong is a distinct issue from whether or not it's legal.
We think that it should be crystal clear to every citizen exactly what is permitted, what is forbidden, and what the penalties are for forbidden behavior otherwise we run the risk of holding different people to different standards such as punishing perhaps people of color at a harsher rate than white people, for instance.
We think that any time you allow vagueness into the law you allow more bias on behalf of judges and ultimately that this will undermine the justice system as a fair way to deliver punishment.
So for these two reasons we should abolish the antisocial behavior orders.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should tax plastic bags.
Two main areas of clash: the first on incentives.
Under this, two independent arguments first one business incentives.
Because recognize that the massive way in which plastic bags are propagated throughout society and used like realistically produced in the first place is because grocery stores, small businesses, any like sales sector job or market needs them and like uses them in order to let people take goods out of their stores.
And the reason that they like don't always offer paper or more renewable alternatives is because it's really cheap to mass produce plastic bags and buy them from like corporations.
We think the only way in which you force them to see this as not the most like the most efficacious matter or the most cheap matter is if you stop making it cheap, which is exactly what a trash like a plastic bag tax does.
It makes it so that alternatives become more accessible and more attractive because now it's going to be cheaper for you to provide paper alternatives with like the option to buy your own renewable plastic like bags.
We also think that this is great right off the bat, because it means that you change the system at the root of the problem and don't have to force individuals to be the changing force.
Like recognize that it's really difficult to get individual people to act in a cohesive manner, and so we think when business do that businesses do it for us and don't provide individuals with another choice that's really good.
But even if you don't think that, we can that we get change on the individual level as well.
Like recognize if you have to pay for your bags your infinitely more likely to bring your own or by permanent ones.
This is true even if the amount of money that the plastic bags cost is really small because people automatically internalize it as something that is not worth it or something that previously didn't exist in thus is like not worth paying for.
Like an extra expenditure.
And so we think that you actually get better like small stick efficacy on our side of the house insofar as individual people are more incentivized to bring their own bags so they don't have to pay the ten cent fee for every single plastic bag they might take and use.
And I mean that's like really good insofar as like collective groups of individuals make up the rest of our society.
If we can get enough individuals to change their behavior, and we think that given that like the vast majority of people aren't those who are at the top of society, that they're oftentimes those who are like upper to like lower to completely lower class, and so we like to think that it's good to that and we think of these people are like the most likely to actually enact change on a large like large scale.
Our second area of clash is about facilitating long term change.
Like recognize that plastic bags are uniquely really bad.
Their non biodegradable so they tend to sit in landfills for years and years and years while they leak chemicals into the surrounding land, and prevent any kind of ecosystem from developing there.
They also get into the ocean and forests which then chokes and suffocates the animals that have gotten used to living there and we think that's really bad.
Like in a lot of ad campaigns that show you that the poor seals that are getting choked by plastic bags and plastic coke holders.
And we think it's really important to preserve those groups as well given the land on which they live is land that they've occupied for infinitely longer than we've occupied the land we're in.
We also think that like what this means is that you need to phase them out of use, and you can only do that by changing the overall incentive structure that underlies it.
As long as plastic bags are cheaper corporations and individuals will not change, because it is the most pragmatic answer for them.
But the second those plastic bags cost more people no longer justify the cost and they will turn to alternatives.
We prefer a world in which everybody just brings their own god damn like long term bags with them and that's what like and we think you only get that on our side of the house.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish primary elections.
What we mean by this is that instead of having a situation in which you get all of this the candidates from a certain party and then only registered members of the party vote on it, instead we're just going to have all of the people regardless of who the party majorly wants go straight to the general election.
Three three main areas of clash, first on the fight for moderates.
The problem in the status quo is that because primaries require appeal to the registered party voters, candidates often have to appear more more extreme than would be productive for themselves or for the world.
It basically ends up weeding out moderates by requiring you to appeal not to the majority of everyone that exists regardless of their political view, but specifically to the majority of republican or democrat voters.
And in order to gain a majority ahead of any opponents you might be facing, you have to make sure that you capture at least some of the radicalized base, like you have to be able to appeal to as many republicans as possible.
However those that can't win in primaries might be able to win the general election because the majority of voters are more moderate than those registered to a party or the party elites that are likely to offer you money during the primaries.
Not only this but we also think that pragmatically these people end up with better policies as well because we think that one of the reasons trump got by in the republican primaries is because he was able to buy up that white supremacist alt-right base in a way that an opponent who had more moderate views wouldn't.
However we think that in a more general election the moderate would be more appealing because not the because the majority type of person isn't that racist and isn't that like terrified of the world at large and globalization.
So we think that on our side of the house you're actually much less likely to get such extreme policies because those were the people who manage to get by in extreme base.
Our second area of clash is about providing independence from the party to candidates.
Because primaries are controlled by the political party, it forces candidates to pay a certain amount of lip service to the party that they're coming from.
So those who don't if those who don't do so get less screen time, they're pushed out of debates, and basically it's made very difficult for them to continue being candidates within that party.
But we want and like literally if the primary like if the party decides that you aren't a popular enough candidate, they can just cut you out of the debates in the primary.
However in the real world, people don't get cut out of debates because all candidates are equally important to determining who becomes president and so you don't have to give over some kind of deference to whatever party is governing you because the party is the people.
We think this creates much more honest candidates who are unwilling to pay that lip service but we also think that it creates better candidates given that the party leadership is often made up of more traditional people who have been there for a longer.
Our third area of clash is about how it changes campaigning strategies and promotes one that is a lot more wholistic throughout the election.
Currently primaries allow individuals only to campaign to the party which lets them narrow down their agenda a lot more.
However we want a more honest strategy with a less extremist base, and we want them to be able to appeal to everybody equally.
We think what currently happens is that individual candidates can essentially garner enough power and monetary help while they are running in the primaries so that once it gets to the general election, they have enough money to buy certain individuals' votes or they can more easily hijack people.
But we think what happens on our side of the house is that individuals are forced to campaign even to those who they didn't care about before because it's no longer as much about the money as it was previously with so many candidates running all at once.
For these reasons, we are very proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should make community service mandatory.
We, we mean the united states or any western liberal democracy really, and the way we would make it mandatory is that every single person above the age of like, let's say, twelve, would have to partake in a certain number of hours per month.
We don't really care how many, we'd say like probably like four, on average, is like a good amount to require an individual to devote in terms of their time and meets like the criteria for this debate.
With that, two main areas of clash: the first on value systems.
Recognize that like mandating something like community service necessarily builds community engagement and patriotism.
People rally around the things that they contribute to and feel pride in.
It's really hard to feel pride in shitty bureaucracy, and ugly parks, and ugly roads that haven't been cleaned, or like like beer cans underneath the bleachers, things like that.
Like these are things that are naturally not something that people enjoy looking at and are often signs of the ways in which our society is falling falling apart at the edges, which is never something that individuals want to acknowledge.
I think but it's really easy to feel pride in everyone and yourself when you are contributing to the system and making it look good.
When you can say that the reason that that highway looks nice today is because I helped make it do so, we think that's when people like start to actually feel good about their societies and feel good about contributing.
But we also think that it creates a good community cohesion, right?
Like it brings people together regularly and builds relationships between them.
We think that like it's natural the more I see someone, the more likely I am to have a functional relationship with them, because it gives me time to get close to them.
And if it's someone who I initially had a bad impression of, getting more exposure is oftentimes what is needed in order to change that impression.
So we think it's really good that now individual communities have a space in which individuals have to interact with each other at the hopes of finding connections.
Like we think we live in a more and more lonesome world as technology increases and the distance between our houses increases, and so we think it's really good when there's a reason for communities to come together.
But also, I think it's just like a good value to have people in your community that are used to doing good, right?
Like recognize that there's a problem right now where people see community service as this like extra tidbit that they might do if they feel like it, and they ought be praised if they do it.
The problem here is that we think that it's good to propagate an idea that it is communal activity to build a society and that just because you are helping someone does not make you a god among men.
So we think that normalizing community service within society means that individuals are actually going to make this a priority first, but also that they're going to feel less resentment towards others having known that they are just as contributing and less full of themselves and entitled when they actually help, because it begins to be built into your schedule on a normal level and normalized into our lives.
Our second area of clash is about bettering society.
Recognize that there's a lot of stuff that needs housekeeping and work that bureaucracy can't or doesn't have the resources to reach.
Like, it's impossible for them to clean all the house highway sites efficiently or frequently enough for it to make a difference, but also no one wants to have that job on a regular basis.
So it oftentimes gets left off for delinquents anyway, who really don't want to be there and don't have an incentive to do a good job.
So, requiring community service allows us to fill in those gaps the government has no ability to do so.
You make society better at almost no cost to the individual.
Given that everyone is doing it, we especially think it's at no cost because it means that society will adjust to the mandatory time.
Like we think a really bad problem right now, when it's not mandatory, is that it's really difficult for adults to find a time in their schedule for which they're not working and not like having plans, they can go and do community service.
But we think that if you have an allotted number of slots per month that during which you can do them, your work doesn't have a choice but to let you off.
It's kind of like jury duty.
Once it's legally mandated, they can't persecute you for going through with it.
We also think that it just makes a really big difference in terms of long-term function.
Like a lot of government agencies run poorly because there's just not enough manpower to do all the like fundamental work, like organizing files, and we think that when you spend the evening doing this, you contribute to the overall efficiency of society.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should adopt atheism.
By this we mean that people living in western countries today or highly developed countries today should not believe in a god.
So we're agnostic on other forms of supernatural phenomena, but we're arguing that you shouldn't believe in the christian god or allah or similar beings.
Three arguments.
The first is about empiricism.
This is the idea that we should base our beliefs based on what we can observe in the physical universe.
This is the idea that underlies the scientific revolution that's created the world that we live in today.
There is no empirical evidence for the existence of god despite the best efforts of many very intelligent people to prove that there is.
I'm reminded of the famous words of yuri gagarin when he first went into space, I looked and looked but I did not see god.
Ultimately the physical universe has, to date, been able to be explained through natural phenomena, with no need to resort to supernatural phenomena for an explanation.
What that means is that for people who want to define god as the explanation for what we don't know, god becomes an ever shrinking pocket of scientific ignorance.
But what's more, we tell you that it's also problematic to base our ideas of god based on the absence of knowledge.
Short of any positive evidence for the existence of god, we tell you that we ought differ to not believing in him.
This type of thinking has been successful in uncovering various scientific advancements in the past and generally advancing society.
So we think that it's a good standard to apply in this instance as well.
Lacking any positive evidence for the existence of god, we should adopt atheism.
Our second argument concerns truth.
So essentially we tell you that you ought make a good faith attempt to believe what is true.
We think that this is important because if people don't attempt to believe the truth, then it's difficult to form a consensus about how people ought live, act, or behave.
If everyone determines their own, effectively arbitrary standards for what is and is not true, then ultimately people have difficulty communicating with one another.
But by pursuing the actual truth, or the highest truth available to us, we can all come to common ground.
With that in mind we tell you that there are a few reasons not to believe in god.
I've already spoken about empiricism and the lack of physical evidence for god, but we'd also like to point out that people probably ought be skeptical about new claims.
Consider the following, it is not impossible that there is a giant teapot behind the planet jupiter, always blocked from sight on earth by the planet, and invisible to probes chance after as to when they went by the planet jupiter.
But no one believes in this because people apply a certain standard of skepticism.
If someone makes a tremendous claim with no physical evidence, the burden is on them to back it up.
Similarly we think the burden is on people who believe in god to prove that he does exist.
Because the idea that there's a super powerful being that created the universe baffles the mind.
It is not inherently intuitive, it's something that's culturally constructed and we think that it needs to be proven before anyone ought believe it if they're concerned with believing what is true.
Our third and final argument is about the problem of evil.
And this effectively rules out belief in a christian or muslim style god.
Basically christians and muslims believe that god is all knowing, all powerful, and omni-benevolent, which is to say always good.
Yet, the world is an evil place full of horrible things that happened to innocent people.
So it is impossible then that there is a god who knows and understands all these things, omniscience, has the power to stop them or not to have created them in the first place, omnipotence, and is always good, omni-benevolent, because that being, being always good, would choose not to have things like hunger or genocide in the world that we live in.
But at that point where we observe those phenomena in the real world, we think it's clear that that god does not exist.
And since this is the god that most people globally believe in, we think that ultimately we should be atheist rather than believe in such a being.
For these reasons we should adopt atheism.
Thank you."
"Abstinence-only sex education should be mandatory.
We're gonna present two arguments as to why we think that abstinence-only sex education is the best form of sex education within school systems.
The first is about parental choice, and the second is about how we think that other forms of sex ed increase the amount of sexual pressure that people experience, especially in young adult young adulthood.
All right, so on parental choice: we think that sexual education is an incredibly personal decision to make as far as how parents would like to educate their child about sex.
This is subject to many moral and religious beliefs that we simply think the state is not adequately able to account for in other forms of sexual education.
We think that parents understand both their child's sentiments and ideas of how that child relates to the world and relates to their own sexuality and have a better idea of how they want to rear their child.
We would say that parents earn the right to make this decision about how their child is going to grow up, about how that child is going to mature and become a sexual individual and learn about their sexual side, because they've taken on the responsibility, they've accepted the responsibility for that child's well-being and in doing so, we think they've attained at least a modicum of rights as to decide how that child is going to be reared, especially when abstinence sex education does not directly cause more harm to the child.
We would say that abstinence-only sex ed allows parents to have much more leeway in how far they want their children to go.
We think that abstinence-only sex education can make children aware of the risks of pregnancy, make them aware of sexually transmitted diseases, make them aware of the risk of unwanted pregnancy, all of these things, while ensuring them that if they do not have sex, if they do not choose to undertake these activities, that they will be safe.
If they want to know more, firstly, their parents are able to be a source of information for them.
But when there's a disconnect between child and parent, there are alternative resources that are widely available, through the internet, that allow children to learn about these things in reasonable ways.
This isn't two thousand or two thousand ten, this is a day a time in our society when there are an immense amount of good resources available to people to learn about how to have safe sex, but we do not think that it is the responsibility of the state to make that decision for parents and to make that decision about all people's children.
So secondly, why do we think there's an increase in sexual pressure?
We would say that many people in high school and in early adulthood still feel very squeamish about sex.
They they don't they're incredibly young and immature as far as their sexual activity, their sexual appetite, and this brings sex right into the classroom.
It brings people into a setting to learn about sex and to learn about sexuality in an area where we think they are least likely to be comfortable, that is, within the classroom.
We think that this, for many people, brings a lower level of maturity to the discussion in order to hide the fact that they're uncomfortable with what's being discussed.
And we think people are more likely to be distracted, and people are more likely to take away bad information when they learn about it in an environment where they do not feel comfortable discussing these types of things.
We think there's already an immense amount of pressure to have sex amongst young people in our society today.
We think that sexual education makes that more pronounced, while at the same time our sexual education that isn't abstinence-only sex education makes that more pronounced, be as it doesn't just engage you on the risks of sex, but how to actually have sex in a safe way, how to have sex, and what sexual activity can be like, which we think breeds more tension, more sexual pressure within the classroom.
Because parents should have a right to make this decision about how their child will grow up and because we think the school setting is a bad one to learn about safe sex, abstinence-only sex education should be mandatory."
"We should subsidize journalism, because journalism, the process of of purveying this accurate accurate quality information is absolutely vital to a functioning democracy, and such journalism of good quality is dying out.
So, those are going to be the things I'm going to discuss.
But first, let's talk a little bit about the model, about what exactly subsidizing journalists going to look like.
The way, in which I foresee this being played out, is the government is essentially going to give out grants to am journalist companies am, so could be like, examples could be something like the sun sentinel in florida, am probably not the washington post or the new york times maybe, because I foresee this being used primarily as need based grants, for more local industries or state industries, that are struggling or struggling meet ends meet arm more so.
That's where I think the money should be going.
So let's first start by talking about why journalism is dying out, and then talking about why this death is such a big problem, and about why the subsidies are going to be very good and important.
So, obviously, am it's incredibly difficult for journalists companies to make money these days, and journalists in general to make money these days, and the reason for that is because you can access most things on the internet for free, even if you try to instead of pay having to pay a subscription, you could still have things like an ad blocker, so you can't really profit as a journalist company that way anyway, and it's also often times more convenient for customers and consumers, because instead of having to pay a blanket prescription for all subscription for all the content, you can be more selective and only read the things he wants read online.
So, this is obviously particularly bad for local news, and am not nationalist news	in nature.
But, this presents a very big problem as far as the way in which it's being replaced, and how it does for journalism.
So, obviously the media and journalism are incredibly important to democracy.
There's a reason why freedom of press is a protected first amendment right in the US constitution, because ultimately, everything that's involved in our decisions is reliant on information: when we're deciding on conclusions, when we're deciding on our beliefs, all of these things can, all of our values, and all the things that we think can only be generated based on the experiences we have in the world, and this this could include both our lived experiences, but in a lot of cases, this is based on the things that we read, or the things that we here about, or have as an academic source of discussion, or official source of discussion.
So, this is very important because, in order for there for you to have actually truly like educated beliefs, it's necessary for you to be looking at sources that are of good quality.
Am and that's not good, because when you have traditional journalism, the journalism that is now dying out, it meets this bar in most cases, maybe not fox news, but most cases you have extensive vetting in editing, you have integrity to make sure that it is actually factually true, am, more limited misrepresentation of facts, things like that.
But, the problem is that when you see the the void, that we see being filled out, is overwhelmingly things like fake news that is being pushed out on facebook, am things like that.
For example, like hillary clinton has killed like eight people, and was laughing about it afterwards, nonsense like that can get ten million clicks on facebook, because of the way those algorithms work.
And this is the kind of news it's replacing.
And it's replacing it effectively, because it's much more sensationalist in nature.
But, this creates a society in which you're having much less discourse much less founded in fact, so this is how you get such extreme positions on the right wing , positions that are such like unfounded in education or fact, or reality.
So, this is something that's very bad, and this is also particularly bad not just for the national level, based on those kinds of phenomenons I talked about, but it also limits engagement with the local level, and it makes it so that it's harder to have am good and accurate quality news reporting, on things that happen on the local level, which is quite bad, given that a whole lot of governing, that impacts your day to day life, happens on a local level.
So, for all those reasons we should subsidize journalism."
"Three main reasons we think the affordable care act brings more good than harm: one, it is a step in the right direction and probably the greatest step that could have been taken given the american ethos, two, it gives collective bargaining power to the little people within a medical system, and three, it anchors a broken market in price-setting.
Let's start talking about these one by one: so, first of all, let's talk about getting everyone insurance.
The american system is, to an extent, broken.
It is broken because medical healthcare, which should be a basic right afforded to anyone, regardless of how much money they have, means they have, etcetera, is considered one of those staples of the free market that america loves so much.
What does this mean?
It means that unlike most modern countries who have national health care given to them by the state, at least to some extent, and then maybe private health care on the side in order to advance, they stick by their private health care, they have all private health care.
Now, private health care is a problem because it prices at least some people out of having healthcare.
Now, they may say on the other side we agree with this, we think obamacare is problematic because it still doesn't cover everyone.
What we want to tell you is this: by making obamacare still to an extent a version of private health care, simply one that is affordable to everyone or almost everyone, you create a situation in which the american people are able to stomach the equivalent of national healthcare.
So, we think it is the best way to get to the coverage percentages that you have today, namely that only nine percent of people are now not covered by health care.
Secondly, we think it gives collective bargaining power to the weakest in society.
We think one of the biggest problems of being ill, of being poor, of being harmed is that when you need help most, there is no one there who can help you and you cannot fight for yourself.
This is not solved by private insurance companies because private insurance companies have a market around them which enables battling between them and factions to be created which means no one insurance provider has that much bargaining power versus doctors, versus hospitals, versus pharmaceutical companies.
At the point at which you create a baseline medical provider like you have in medicaid, you get substantially greater bargaining power.
This is why medicaid gets their prescriptions at a fraction of the price as anyone else on the market, because they've cornered the market on sixty-five years year-olds and up.
This is why obamacare can do the same thing for the general population.
By creating a baseline that becomes easily the most popular medical insurance in the country, they give massive bargaining power specifically to those poor people who need obamacare and therefore can't afford to pay that much for their medication or for their hospitalization.
This fixes that problem.
Lastly, it creates an anchor in a broken market.
The problem with free market in healthcare is that regardless of the price, you'll be willing to pay it if you're able to do so.
There is no price too high for saving your own life or saving the life of your loved one, your child, your wife.
Now, there is a price too high in that people are literally incapable of paying it, despite wanting to, but that is the actual line, literally being unable to pay for it.
There is no price that people would be unwilling to pay and that creates a problem in the market 'cause it means it continuously strives to go up and this is why you see rising medical care prices year after year after year.
By creating a powerful insurance company that anchors the price by saying we set the price at seventy-five dollars a month and that's where we're gonna keep it because we're government-backed and we can do this and this is what we do, you're essentially forcing all of the other insurance companies to contend with that market price, therefore creating an anchor, a price above which people won't be willing to pay not because they don't care about their health, but because at some point, they have a place where they can do it for cheaper.
For these reasons, we think obamacare has done more good than harm."
"We should abolish marriage.
So a few clarifications we want to set up for this debate: firstly, we would say that when we're going to abolish marriage we would abolish state recognized marriage.
So religious marriage ceremonies would still be allowed to happen but the state would have no marriage er no marriage contracts that are enforced by the state and so any sort of benefits that exist currently due to marriage.
For example, tax benefits associated with marriage, we would transition those types of benefits into other different types of incentives.
For example, current incentives that exist for having children, for home ownership, we think that you could transition the the savings from marriage benefits to those types of programs instead.
Ok so, first off we would say that marriage itself is an outdated institution that is based on problematic ideals.
So when marriage was first come up with, when marriage was first instituted, firstly it was an entirely religious act.
It was not something that was done through the state, it was not something that was done through any sort of country or non secular actor, but rather it was done by local community churches and local community religious institutions and it was done as a religious act.
Because of this we think that it is inherently improper for the state to take over giving out marriages and performing marriage ceremonies for people because we think that it firstly it dilutes this religious act, and makes those types of religious commitments worse off, but it also creates an entanglement between church and state that we think is unacceptable in develop societies.
Furthermore, marriage itself is a concept we think is incredibly patriarchal and shouldn't be endorsed by the state.
Marriage, in a sense, was created so that women would be sold to their husbands and and a family would get some sort of dowry for that woman.
We think that this idea, this old idea of selling off a woman to a man so that the man, the husband, can now own the wife, we think that these are just incredibly problematic notions and the entire ceremony around marriage, the entire ideal surrounding marriage, is deeply based on these old patriarchal notions that we don't think should be perpetuated through society, especially through the state.
When the state has marriage as opposed to just religious institutions we think it signals that marriage is a normal thing that people should seek out to do rather than if it is only a religious ceremony we think only certain groups of people that have a particularly strong tie to be institution of marriage would carry it out.
And this is important because as we can see in our in our society in the status quo, marriage is a failing institution.
More marriages end in divorce than in any other outcome and we think that this is a sign that marriage is something that most people are not suited for.
Let's be frank, most people change in dramatic ways over the course of their life, especially during a marriage.
Sometimes people's life trajectories are going in different ways, sometimes people personalities changed dramatically, and sometimes the partner that you've had for forty years isn't the same partner you want to be with for the rest of your life.
We think that when marriage is institutionalized within the state, it incentivizes people to stay in bad relationships longer, to try and make their marriage worse, and to force themselves into situations that they are not entirely comfortable with.
When the state no longer recognizes marriages, when the state no longer incentivizes marriages, we think fewer people are likely to opt into that system that system as it exists.
And we think more likely people are going to choose to be flexible in their relationships.
People are still going to want to have long term partners, people are still going to raise children with those partners, but when a relationship is falling apart, when it no longer provides utility for the people that are involved in that relationship, we don't think that people should feel social pressure to stay in that relationship.
It harms their health, it harms their personal well being, and it harms their emotional well being.
And we think that by abolishing marriage, by abolishing state marriage, you undo those incredibly dramatic harms.
And for these reasons we should abolish marriage."
"Taxation is a necessary evil.
We have to tax our citizens to be able to provide essential services or public goods that the market cannot provides all by itself.
But beyond that, we believe that high taxation is just an inefficient economic tool and an unjust one.
Progressive taxation punishes the rich for succeeding in life and by doing so, it mainly harms the poor and therefore, we must oppose it.
When we talk about a flat tax rate, we mean a set percentage of your income and your expenditure that's being taxed.
So let's say that we set the income tax to be twenty percent.
This means that whoever makes a hundred dollars a month will pay twenty dollars in taxes, and whoever makes a thousand dollars a month will pay two hundred dollars in taxes, and the same goes for expenditure.
The more that some product that you consume is going to be more expensive, the higher your tax the tax that you pay are going to be.
So, the first argument deals with fairness.
Why do we believe that a flat tax rate is more fair than progressive taxation?
So, the basic argument that usually comes out of opposition in regards to fairness is usually that the more that you receive and the more that you enjoy the public goods that society has to offer, then it's it's more fair that you would have to pay more in return.
But we have a few problems with this.
One: this entire logic rests on the theory of social contract.
Now, we believe that this is just philosophical mumbo jumbo because no one has ever gave his actual consent to, you know, give up certain rights in order to gain other rights, and we say that without explicit consent, it's just unclear to us why any of this stands.
But two: even if this would have been the case, this assumes that my income testifies necessarily to how privileged I was, and that's just incorrect.
What if I grew up hard?
What if I had to build myself, with my own two hands, against all of the odds, and now I'm a successful businessman?
This means that I have received less and now I have to give back more.
How is this fair?
Three: we say that we mustn't forget that under a flat tax rate system, the rich still contribute far more.
The taxation on income is higher, their taxation on on expenditure is also higher because they buy more expensive products.
If they own a firm, then they have to also pay corporate tax.
All of this amounts to a much higher contribution by the well-off citizens, which is essentially what opposition wants.
Therefore, their burden in this debate is not to just explain why the rich should contribute more, but why all of this is still not enough and in addition to this, we also need to require that their contribution in percentile is going to be bigger.
We think that this is already a vengeful logic.
This is essentially deciding that we're setting out to punish whoever made it in life, and that is the opposite of fair.
Another problem that we have with progressive taxation that has to do with fairness stems from the complicated progressive system as opposed to the simplicity of the flat rate system.
The fact that a progressive system is so complicated, with all of the tax brackets and the different and complicated ways in which you calculate exactly how much needs to how much everyone needs to pay, this creates a situation in in which it is the richest citizens that are able to find all sorts of creative ways to avoid paying taxes because they can afford, you know, to hire professional advisers that specialize in all these types of tricks.
All you have to do to find a a relevant example is to look at the current president of the united states.
So, we say that this provides a huge advantage to the richest citizens, and we think that that's another realistic problem that opposition have in this debate and that would it would be quite hard for them to justify under their principles.
But lastly, let's talk about really quickly about efficiency.
And this argument is really quite simple and it says the following.
We say that taxation always operates as an inhibitor on expanding the economic activity.
People react rationally to incentives, especially the rich, which are the ones that are directly affected by progressive taxation.
Now if they know that a big chunk of the revenues that they generate is going to be taken away from them, they are going to minimize the the economic activity up until the point in which it would be optimal.
This means that the higher the tax is going to be, I will hire less employees.
This means that whoever that the people that really get hurt from this, by the end of the day, are the weakest people that need those jobs, and they are the ones that suffer the most.
So for all of these reasons, please propose."
"We should abandon gmail.
So, gmail probably needs no introduction.
It's google's email service and it's very popular, because it's free to use and offers lots of storage, and by abandon, we mean that people should move to other email providers that take a firmer stance on one's privacy and security.
So our our first argument is that google harvests our data from gmail.
It's a well-known fact that google is really an ad company that happens to provide all these services to get us to look at ads.
Google doesn't make any money off of you checking your inbox if you aren't looking at ads every time you do.
The same applies to google search and many of their other services.
Ultimately, the way that google make so much money is that they take data from your emails and your search preferences and use them to target better ads to you.
In other words, they do a better job than other providers at figuring out what you want to see, but the way that they do that is by reading your email.
No, I'm not saying that there's some intern who can look at your email right now and see, "" oh, well, this person's going to canada next month and he just bought a pair of shoes. ""
Rather, it's that they use metadata from your email, such as keywords or who you email, in order to determine what you might like to see.
But this is a huge violation of our privacy.
Most people don't really understand how this metadata works and don't realize how much information google is able to access about them.
But moreover, we tell you that no one should really have to use a service or ought use a service where they can't choose to opt out of the spying.
The only way to get away from having your data harvested and misused by google would ultimately be to use a different service.
And there have been many people who have had harmful effects of looking at certain ads, such as people who have been outed as being gay, because google starts displaying ads about, you know, homosexual websites and things like that, based on their emails or search preferences.
So there are real world effects that this can have that we ought avoid.
And our second argument is about how this affects the way we interact with our government.
As is now well-known at this point, the US government spends an astronomical amount of time and money spying on people not only in america, but in various countries around the world.
Yet, the US government doesn't have any way to collect data if we don't freely give it away to corporations.
It's not like the NSA is sitting in a black van outside my apartment right now, listening to me talk to IBM.
Rather, they look at the things that I google and they get that information by the company's cooperation in many instances.
So if the government wants to know, for instance, if I'm a risk of joining isis, I guess that's not a big problem anymore, but historically, then they might ask google to turn over my search records and my emails so that they can get that metadata in order to see if I am the type of person who might be at risk of going to syria to join isis.
Ultimately, this government spying simply could not happen if we used other companies' email services.
There are plenty of email services that refuse to cooperate with NSA spying efforts, unlike google.
First of all, we ought reward these companies for doing a civic service by refusing to cooperate with quasi-legal and certainly socially-damaging spying efforts.
But moreover, these companies will go away if no one patronizes them and all we'll be left with is companies like google that freely interact with the NSA and just give them all of our data.
But moreover, the whole government spying apparatus, as it exists right now, would just be untenable if hundreds of millions of people switched over to other email services.
So this would reduce the incentive for them to put so much effort into spying on us online, which would ultimately protect our privacy and make us more free.
So because google harvests our data and because the NSA abuses that data, we should abandon gmail.
Thank you."
"The internet brings more harm than good.
So we think that necessarily this is a comparative debate.
Obviously there's some good and some bad things that the internet does.
We're going to explain to you why we think that it does more bad things that good.
And in terms of what we mean by the internet, because this term is kind of vague, we think that we're talking about consumer access to highly networked computers.
So back before the internet became very popular you still had networked computers at universities, and in the military and government.
So we're fine with that kind of thing.
What we're talking about are, you know, websites like google, and access to a lot of information at once from consumers rather than the existence of networked computers.
We think businesses and things like that will still use them.
So two big points: the first is about security.
I'd like to point out that the internet has probably done more to make people's information available that anything in history.
I think that this is a two edged sword.
On the one hand people now have access to lots of books and news and other information that they didn't have access to before, but at the same time all of our personal information is out there as well.
We think that, we're gonna talk in just a minute about why this is bad for individuals, but it's also really dangerous for states.
If you look at the twenty sixteen US presidential election, the main way that the russians were able to intervene and influence the election and help donald trump to beat hillary clinton, was to hack for personal data and emails from the democratic national committee.
So because of the internet countries along the around the globe can now interfere with each other selections and subvert democracy.
We think that this is a massive harm, that it'll reduce people's faith in democracy worldwide and ultimately that the high cost to democracy of the easy access to the internet outweighs any of the benefits that the other side will be able to tell you about.
But even on an individual level, even if you think that that's a bit extreme, we tell you that the access to things like banking data is also really harmful.
Very few people probably have their credit card information stolen before the internet, because it would've been so difficult.
You'd have to go to their house and steal their mail, and hope that their bank messed up and didn't send a secure letter and things like that.
But using the internet, lots of people, especially the elderly and people with less education, are taken advantage of and have their banking details stolen and have their lives basically ruined in this way.
And even if insurance or credit card companies step up and don't punish individuals for being the victims of crimes, we still think that it's very likely that they lose a large amount of money on this issue so ultimately we think that's a big harm.
And lastly I want to talk about doxing.
It's much more difficult for people to maintain anonymity because of the internet.
This may sound counterintuitive, you might say oh but people have so much anonymity on the internet, but the relative ease with which someone's identity can be found and widely spread around means that you may have less anonymity.
It may be more difficult to hold an unpopular opinion, or political belief than it used to be, because you run the risk that everyone you know will find out because of the internet, if someone decides to hack you and reveal your information which is called doxing.
So our second point is about the isolation we think the internet creates.
Recognize that because of the internet people feel like they are being social, or feel like there needs are being met when actually they aren't.
Social media is a good example of this.
People think that by talking to someone on facebook or twitter or whatever, that they're getting their social needs met and that they're healthy when really they aren't.
They're very unhappy.
We think that the internet encourages us to be unsatisfied with our own lives and to be more envious of others.
Now people have known for thousands of years that envy is a dangerous thing.
This is why we're told not to covet our neighbors things in the bible, but on top of that we tell you that it encourages people to make unwise decisions when they plan their own lives based on unrealistic expectations fed by the internet.
We also tell you that things like online shopping feed into consumer culture that is ultimately unsustainable.
People are buying things they don't need with money they don't have, and the internet has driven this phenomenon to new heights.
The other team might get up here and say that this is been a problem for a long time, that they used to say this about TV as well, but the ease of access on websites like amazon means that people have access to more goods than ever, but at the same time they're also being told that they need these goods and uniquely effective advertising is convincing them to spend their money, and we think that people are being taken advantage of.
So for all these reasons we think that the internet is dangerous to society and to individuals, and so it brings more harm than good.
Thank you."
"We should ban fishing.
So when we say this we're not really talking about your granddad and his friends going out to the pond to catch some bass, we're thinking more about the kind of large scale aquaculture that takes place around the world right now.
Fishing is a major industry for many countries, especially island nations or coastal towns, but we think that ultimately it needs to be banned.
The way that we would do this would be a gradual phase-out by refusing to issue new permits and by gradually restricting the areas where people are allowed to fish until the industry is no longer able to exist.
So our first argument is that we need to let fisheries recover if we're going to be able to have fish in the future.
Many of the world's largest fisheries such as cod fisheries in the northern atlantic have completely collapsed in the last century.
The amount of wild fish is much smaller than it was in nineteen hundred and this is due to over exploitation.
Every country demands that they be allowed to fish as much as they want to.
Treaties are made that exist entirely to promote the egos of certain countries like iceland rather than consider the fact that some countrys' fishing is much more detrimental than other countrys' fishing just because of the types of natural resources that are available to that country.
But we would tell you that all human beings have an equal claim to the world's bounty and that because most fisheries lie outside of national waters that we need to preserve them not only for other countries but we need to preserve them for future generations.
If we continue at our current pace, in three hundred years no one will be able to eat fish and we think that it's unacceptable to take away those natural resources from future generations when they have every much right to them as we do ultimately therefore we think we need to look fisheries recover by phasing out fishing for several decades so that they are able to come back to a level where they can be sustainably harvested.
Our second argument is that fishing is just the worst way to gather food for people.
First on an economic level, seafood is extremely expensive.
It's true that you can buy cheap seafood but that's because all of the externalities have been passed on to the public and away from you.
If you took into account the damages that fishing does to fish populations, the damages that it doesn't terms of pollution, what it does to endangered species, no one would be able to afford seafood except for the very wealthy.
It is by far the least economical type of food.
Ultimately therefore we think that it needs to be phased out because if people won't internalize the costs then we ought simply prevent them from foisting those costs off onto others by continuing to fish when it is in no way sustainable or acceptable.
But it's also by far the least environmentally friendly way to access food.
Most people don't eat any wild animals except for seafood and someone can say oh well we have farmed tilapia but we're fine with that we're talking about harvesting wild fish like tuna and ultimately there's no way to make harvesting wild food sustainable for seven billion peoples at the current rate of consumption therefore it needs to be phased out because it's not practical.
And our third point is that we need to ready communities for climate change.
In our world we phase out fishing over a matter of time so that communities that rely on fishing can either go away as people will immigrate to other areas or change their primary industry over to something more sustainable.
In the other world where fishing continues unregulated climate change is going to suddenly wipe out fisheries or gradually completely eliminate it as an option and people will be left in the same situation with no period to adjust.
So in our world we force people to adjust to the new world that is coming because of climate change, one in which fishing will no longer be possible in most places where it is today and therefore we think that this is actually the more humane thing for those communities that will be affected because we let them better adapt.
So for all of these reasons, we should ban fishing.
Thank you."
"Assisted suicide should be a criminal offense.
When we're talking about assisted suicide we think we're primarily talking about physician assisted suicide in which someone who is in intensive care or oftentimes are terminally ill are allowed to die by the physician that is with them, or are assisted in dying by being taken off life support, or doing a certain drug, a number of ways that this can happen.
So two reasons why we think that physician assisted suicide should be a criminal offense.
Firstly because life is sacred and that's a starting point that we cannot abandon, and secondly because ey this allowing this to be a legal practice pressures people into committing suicide.
So firstly on life.
Life is the basic the right to life is the basic foundational principle on which every other law, every other practice in our society is founded on.
The the idea that that life is sacred and that a right to life is irrevocable is necessary in order for the basic foundational principles of democracy of a liberal system to exist.
For rights to speech to be justified for rights for autonomy, freedom, all these things are an expression of that right to life that we hold at the very foundation of our participation in society.
From this we think that you simply cannot opt out of that system of rights.
The reason for this is that being a part of that rights framework is what distinguishes you as a human being.
It's what allows you to be an agent and it's what makes you a part of the community.
And we don't think that you're able to choose to nullify your participation in that community er in that system.
For example we don't think that we would allow people to contract into a system of slavery in which they give up their ability to live freely and pursue the goals that they choose or to work for who they choose to work for because it would demean their human nature or demean who they are and how they exist fundamentally as a human.
And we don't think that this is something that society should endorse by allowing to be legal.
So we think that furthermore we think that this is something that someone simply cannot turn back from.
That even if they are fully aware of what they're doing, there is no way to fully contemplate what they're doing and from that we think that you cannot allow this to be a legal practice or a legal thing to do because there's no way to revoke the harm that you're doing upon yourself by taking your own life.
So secondly, how we think people may be pressured into committing suicide because of this.
Recognize the situation that these terminally ill patients are in.
They're often being cared for and paid for by their family, undergoing immensely costly medical expenses in a situation in which there doesn't seem to be any sort of hope at the end of the tunnel.
In these situations people can often feel pressured by their family, whether it's directly or indirectly or whether it's intended or not, about the harm or the cost that they are causing the family while they just slowly are in their hospital hoping for some sort of cure that isn't going to come.
In that instance people can feel incredibly demoralized, incredibly harmed.
But even in those instances we wouldn't say that their life has no purpose.
We wouldn't say that they can't gain utility in their place in the world and we wouldn't say that because their life costs more money on to another person that that life still isn't worth while and still isn't invalid.
Given that this is the case and that people may feel pressured into committing suicide where even if they don't have much life left, they still have valuable life ahead, they still have an economy of life that they can spend on being able to gain things that they may want enable to further their ends or to gain joy in a way.
We don't think that people that there should be a legal thing that is able to happen and that assisted suicide should be a criminal offense in order to prevent these types of pressures from overcoming an individual and to ensure that life at the very foundation of our society is accepted as sacred and protected.
And for this reason assisted suicide should be a criminal offense."
"We should end development aid.
In this round we're going to make two main arguments about why we think development aid does more harm than good.
So firstly, let's talk about the problems at home that development aid fails to address.
In the status quo, we believe that the government itself is simply a coercive body, all governments.
It's the body that has the sole ability to use coercive force within its borders and it takes because of that ability to use force, it takes a percentage of individual earnings without any opt out through the form of taxes.
You can't choose not to pay your taxes even if you really don't want to and the government then becomes legitimate and just by serving the needs of its constituents by using the funds that it has taken from them in order to do good for its people.
By collecting those funds and doing more doing greater good with the collected funds than otherwise could have been done through each person spending those funds individually.
International aid falls outside of these boundaries.
While it may be generally good for people to give aid to countries and people in need and to give development aid and to try and help these countries build up their infrastructure.
Like in theory this may be a good thing but we say that the government has an obligation to put its funds back into the state and to public service because those funds were taken away without the consent of the people.
Many domestic issues exist that need to be addressed in the status quo.
Our own infrastructure that for us in the united states needs to be improved, let alone the development of infrastructure abroad.
More additionally, there's our education system which lags behind those of almost every other developed nation in the world.
You can always put that money towards national defense.
Defense being the most important foundational responsibility of the state or it could be used to pay for something like healthcare.
Something that in the united states has the highest cost again of almost any other developed nation in the world.
So maybe development aid would be acceptable if there were no other things that the aid could be spent on.
But it is clearly not the case that that is that that is the world we live in.
There are clearly other things that this money could be used for and it's crucial that this money and only just for this money to be spent domestically which precludes development aid.
Secondarily, we think that development aid causes a dependency problem.
Development aid often leaves countries dependent on nations for assistance moving forward.
In addition to the fact that this money is often spent inefficiently because of things like systems and things like projects of building roads that go to nowhere.
But even if there is development of infrastructure, even if these projects go well, you still need to build up businesses and jobs and a service sector and there's no internal revenue from projects that put together that development to use in order to do this.
There's no sort of increased revenue from those development projects.
May be that because these projects were paid for entirely out of pocket and it's often the case that any sort of benefit, the right to taxation, or the right to some sort of economic gains, development aid is almost always given with something tied to it, some sort of kickback to the state and because of that there's very little likelihood that states will be able to get any sort of profit from this development just the development itself.
Which means that the state if it wants to accomplish building of its economy further, still needs to go out and still needs to get further and further aid from these nations again creating a dependency system.
We think it's preferable for these states to tax themselves, to build up this infrastructure themselves to get loans internationally in order to do these types of things and to build your credit on the world stage.
But frankly, development aid doesn't even accomplish what it should and it is theft.
It is it is paramount to theft as it takes money from the people, from the domestic nation and it puts it abroad without the consent of the domestics.
For these reasons, we should end development aid."
"We should raise the retirement age.
So our proposal is that the retirement age should be pegged to life expectancy.
So if the life expectancy was sixty seven years old back when the retirement age was set at sixty five in the united states and today the life expectancy is seventy five, perhaps the retirement age would be something like seventy two trimming proportional to the higher life expectancy.
So with this in mind we have two main areas for debate.
The first is the purpose of the retirement age.
So we think that fundamentally the goal of having them a retirement age is to protect those who are very elderly from being exploited.
We tell you however that people today are physically healthy much longer and that the types of work that people do, particularly in the types of developed countries that most often have a retirement age, is no longer as physical.
So we see that not only are people in better shape well through their sixties, but also the work they do is less demanding of them physically.
So we think that it's less likely that people will be taken advantage of in the sense that they were actually able to continue working from a physical perspective.
We think that the other side of this is to avoid poor quality of work.
This is the second purpose of the retirement age.
But people are also mentally fit much longer today.
People are more aware of illnesses like alzheimer's and obviously you would still be able to retire if you were mentally unable to work, but on top of that we see that people are better educated and generally speaking better able to continue contributing to the workplace much longer, especially if they're more specialized in their expertise is of even greater value than it might have been in the past.
So we see at that point that we are not seeing people being exploited there and that they are able to continue to do high quality of work and on top of that the equality of people's physical and mental health into old age is only improving and so is life expectancy.
So we think that on our side of the house, because we have a flexible retirement age, they can change as circumstances continue to get better and better.
Ultimately, we will better continue to fulfill the purposes of the retirement age moving into the future.
So this is a very forward looking proposal that we think would actually be much better than the status quo.
So our second argument is about social security, because I think that this is the main reason why the retirement age matters.
People are free to stop working whenever they want.
I'm twenty one.
If I wanted I could quit my job tomorrow and I guess go sit on a beach except that I need money, but we see that society needs lots and lots of people working in order to fund social security.
If you gave it to twenty one year olds then there'll be very few people working and lots and lots of people collecting.
Now perhaps that's an exaggeration, but you do have a similar situation today where more and more people are retired because they're living ten, twenty years past the retirement age and drawing on social security during that time.
What this means is that the proportion of retirees to workers is much greater than was intended when social security and pension schemes were set up in the early twentieth century, and this is threatening the solvency of those programs.
You need a proper balance of workers to retirees, and the best way to do that given that birth rates are falling and you're not likely to get a huge influx of workers, is to reduce the number of retirees.
So obviously what governments could do is to require people to work longer before they're eligible for their benefits.
We think that this is critical because right now programs like social security in the united states are nearing insolvency, which means that potentially people might not be able to receive the benefits they're entitled to in old age.
If we raise the retirement age then everyone can get the benefits they're entitled to.
They just have to wait a little bit longer.
So that seems much more fair to people who have yet to retire.
Rather than just allowing people who have already retired to soak up lots of resources and screw over the next generation.
We think that our policy is likely to ensure that there is always a healthy balance between workers and retirees because as people live longer and longer our policy will solve for that by encouraging them to work longer and longer.
So for these reasons we should raise the retirement age.
Thank you."
"We should ban gratuities.
When we say we're going to ban gratuities, we would mean that we would make it illegal to tip work for all service workers you would you would not legally be allowed to tip those people.
What we're going to do to balance this out also is to ensure that the current rates at which service people are paid are increased, that we would make regulations be put in place for those that are harmed their income levels are made worse off by this ban in order to ensure that they can be paid a proper wage.
So let's talk about this.
First argument is that gratuities generally lower wages.
They depreciate wage value when gratuities are a normal part of society, businesses deflate wages with the promise that service workers can make up money through tipping.
Huge industries such as waiting, hairdressing, other service sectors have been created in such a way where large portions of these people wages come from tips.
This means that large portions of these people's income is also variable, that their actual salary is generally too low to cover the cost of their living expenses.
So it's very difficult for people to plan their lives in advance because they don't have a solid foundation of how much money is going to be coming in down the pipe.
You may get stuck some days with getting people that tip very low rates or don't know about the practice of tipping and therefore tip nothing or generally that you just get a lower lower productivity than normal and fewer people are coming in.
All this means is that people are unable to make plans for the long the long term and they're unable to have any sort of financial security.
Businesses can raise wages while passing on cost to consumers which is likely what would happen after banning gratuities because we think that service workers even without government action would refuse to work for the same wages that they were getting without gratuities and would force businesses to start paying more.
This cost already happens because most people tip which means that there's little actual harm to the consumer in increased cost it just means that instead of writing a number as the tip when you're paying for your bill you just have that number included in the cost of your meal or in the cost of your service.
Wages become more stable on our side of the house making long term planning possible and also allows people to lobby for raises more easily because those raises can be passed on to the consumer via tip.
Alright.
Secondly we think that as a principle quality based wages are bad.
We don't think that the services should have wages that these services and the people that do them should have their wages set by the quality of their service.
You pay for service as a customer and while dramatically low quality service that doesn't actually fulfill what was given by the person giving the service might be something that you would want a refund for.
If the service is given as promised the payment for that service should be rendered.
Tipping allows for curmudgeon's and just people with particularities to artificially determine service people don't deserve fair payment just because they didn't like their service or the type of service that they got eventhough what was promised to them their service was rendered.
There's also no set price for gratuities and thus some people just tip very little money meaning that rates aren't even always quality dependent sometimes they're just dependent on what someone believes to be a just rate when it really isn't.
This means that this means that consumers are misinformed about the impact of their tipping, it means that people that are in the service industries can be arbitrarily made worse off for a week or multiple weeks at a time, and this can have real impact especially because lots of these service workers that rely on gratuities are already low wage workers which means they simply don't have the money to make up for a loss of tipping even for a short period of time.
Given that this is the case, we think that quality based wages simply undermine the free market, they simply undermine what people are supposed to have rendered for their service when you're a service worker.
Given that this is the case, and given that we think that both markets and governments can ensure that raises occur for all the people that are losing that gratuity money, we think that we should ban gratuities."
"Fool me once shame on you.
Fool me twice shame on me.
For me three times double shame on me.
We say that if the state was unsuccessful in rehabilitating someone after giving it two shots already, then his third offense is just as much the state's fault as it is his own, and it's unfair and unreasonable to have him suffer all the consequences and all the blame.
Two arguments in this speech: first, why this proposition disproportionately targets and harms disenfranchised groups and b, why this would prove ineffective an ineffective tool in creating deterrence rendering the three strike system both unjustified and unsuccessful at what it's trying to achieve.
So first argument, all over the world prisons are disproportionately filled with minority population.
This correlation gets even stronger when it comes to re-offenders.
So it's immediately clear to us that these groups are going to be affected from this proposition most of all.
But why is that?
We say that there are three reasons.
Firstly, necessity.
When I literally have no other option, when all else fails and I need to bring food to the table somehow, then I'll resort to stealing money or stealing food.
Secondly, neglect from the government and society.
If I grew up in a poor neighborhood where all the buildings are ugly and all the schools are shitty and I look around and see neighboring areas that have it way better than me, I can't help but feel left behind.
And I start asking myself, why should I abide by the rules?
They don't have my back, why should I answer to them?
And thirdly, and most unfortunate reason, is profiling and biased treatment of the law authorities.
Minority populations suffer from more suspicion in the court systems or police officers patrolling their streets performing random arrests and so on.
This obviously leads directly to more arrests, but also indirectly tips into this distrust in the system that we've mentioned and creates more crime in an indirect way.
So this is a cycle that feeds itself.
These are all things that don't change after you get locked up.
Notice, when you return to your neighborhood, if anything, they get changed for the worse.
Your financial situation might be worse than before, your resentment for society might be bigger, so we see that crime in general, and recurring crime specifically, isn't a consequence of sociopaths as it's so convenient for us to believe, but of ongoing institutional failures that we all have a part in.
Therefore we say that society has a contributory guilt in this and as such it is impossible to offer a solution of giving up on these people, declaring them a lost cause and locking them up forever.
The only fair solution would require understanding that these are people with true hardships that the system overlooked and we really need to pay attention to.
We can attach parole officers, we can send more social workers, etcetera.
It is so convenient for the well off majority to simply tag criminals as monsters and lock them up lock them away from us and feel more secure.
But these are real people whose lives are being destroyed here.
They're they're somebody's son.
It's unfair and unjust.
Let's move on to talk about why deterrence doesn't work.
Let's clarify something: this debate is not about murder or rape, but rather theft and robbery.
Why?
Because if you're caught raping or murdering, then the punishment is usually very long, so a third offense is less likely.
So opposition might say, you know what?
We're more obligated to innocent people than people who committed crimes time and again and this helps deter crime and keeps people safe so we should do it.
This entire idea assumes that these crimes are a consequence of pure rational judgment.
Is if people calculate the probabilities and weigh pros and cons.
But we say that this doesn't work in cases of crimes that are due to lack of options, and as we saw specifically for re offenders, robbery theft are exactly such crime.
Moreover we think that the clear message to these communities, if this law passes, is that the state finally gave up on them for good.
The state that always like we always knew that the state doesn't really give a damn about us, now it doesn't even see us as human beings anymore.
This only enhances the hatred that they feel and the chances for more crime.
Kids have to see their father getting locked up for life for trying to get them a new pair of bikes.
How can they ever be expected to show respect for the police?
So maybe we put one dangerous person off the street, but at that very moment we created three more potentially dangerous people.
So for all of these reasons please propose."
"We should introduce a pollution tax.
As a model I think keep in mind that we are doing this on corporations that breach a certain size I don't think it's the case that with a pollution tax we are attempting to target small businesses or mom and pop shops but once you reach a certain density the tax will be staggered to the amount of carbon output that you as a corporation or factory have.
Three main areas of or two main areas of clash, first on creating accountability.
Recognize that currently companies don't have any of the cost of pollution in terms of their own internalization.
So if I'm a corporation that lets out enough carbon to create the smog that covers japan it doesn't matter to me because there's no world in which that affects me.
It only affects the individuals who have to breathe that in and the cities that are maligned by that smog.
We think it is important for those companies to start finally start feeling the burn of what they have done to the planet but also create a world in which there is incentive for change and we think the only way to do that is to do things like input a carbon tax because recognize that if there's one thing that companies understand it is money and what hurts their profit margin and we think that there are two ways that interact together to force companies to change their behavior or at least maintain accountability when it comes to this carbon tax ie fiscally just the fact that you have to pay money and we think that the money would be quite a lot in order to overcome the fact that some companies can simply afford to buy these kinds of costs.
What this means is that either they have to bite that cost and just have less profit which they oftentimes dislike or they're going to have to pass this cost onto consumers which necessarily creates a world in which consumers are less likely to buy your product for two reasons.
First because it now costs more so maybe they can't afford it anymore or maybe there are other competitors out there providing at a cheaper price because they are paying less carbon tax, but second we think a lot of people especially in the current world are growing more and more ideological when it comes to the way that we treat our planet.
So we think knowing that there's a carbon tax and knowing that this is a company that has to pay a lot of it is enough to discourage a fairly large portion of the population that could still afford the product from having to buy it.
But I think this is something that is a meaningful incentive to change behavior which leads us to our second area of clash which is about decreasing pollution into the long term.
Companies don't want to decrease productivity so they have to find a way to decrease their carbon output without decreasing how much product they're able to put out.
This means that they are likely to do things like buy green technology.
These things are one-time purchases that yes tend to be incredibly expensive and require some amount of shit in terms of efficiency which is why companies don't do it in the status quo, it's simply cheaper for them to continue their previous behavior but when you hit with something like the carbon tax then it stops being then that cost starts being lower than the cost that you are paying on a yearly basis so doing something like applying filters once every four years or so or changing your production so that you are using not fossil fuels but rather sunlight or something similar which would be even cheaper because it would be a one-time change is something that a company is infinitely more likely to do.
This is probably the best outcome possible because it requires the long term depletion in carbon output that we are looking for because companies are structurally changing the way that they behave which structurally and into the long term changes how much carbon they are producing and what their impact on the environment is.
But it also has a really nice side effect in that once you are able to see that green technology is being invested in green technology as a market starts to grow.
There's a problem in the status quo where green tech is seen as risky because the fossil fuel companies hold so much power both over the government and over the global markets but when you have things like large amounts of companies investing in green tech it signals that this is something that is desired which means you are more likely to have more research and development into these technologies, lowering the cost barrier for everyday individuals and smaller companies to acquire it.
We think that's net good.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that this house would ban trans fat.
Before I get into my two areas of clash, a brief overview.
We think it's important to note that corporations will never care about the consumer.
They're always profit-driven, they are looking to make the cheapest and most addictive product that will make them the most amount of money in the shortest amount of time.
What this means is that because corporations will not look out for the consumer and consumers often do not have the information necessary to look out for themselves fully, it oftentimes falls on the part of the government to do so.
What this motion is about is about recognizing that paternalism is justified when a consumer cannot understand the harms that might come to them and corporations are not willing to take responsibility for the impacts of their decisions.
Two main areas of clash: the first about obesity as a rising problem, because we think it's important to recognize that the united states and many other countries, in recent years, have been struggling specifically with the issue of trans fats and other and like the way that we make our food, causing rising rates of obesity.
But these rates of obesity mean more than just the aesthetic of people being fatter rather than skinnier.
It also leads to incredibly unhealthy habits and incredibly unhealthy people.
On a personal level, this means that individuals are dying sooner.
They're getting sicker.
It changes their quality of life, which we think is important in this round insofar as part of a government's purpose is to ensure that humans have a certain quality of life that they can enjoy.
At the point that corporations are affronting that quality of life by providing foods that raise levels of obesity, we think it ought to be banned.
But more than this, we think that there're societal level impacts.
We think that at the point that hospitals' biggest problem right now is small is younger children who do not exercise and eat incredibly unhealthy diets that make him make them very overweight and causes other health-related problems, such as heart problems, early onset diabetes and many many other issues.
The point that we're seen conditions in people younger and younger that should not be seen, due to obesity rather than age, meaning this is all on the part of the government to regulate and protect.
More than this though, we think there's a productivity impact as well.
We think that a lot of the time people have to quit job their jobs earlier if they're getting sicker earlier, if they cannot maintain their like work day because they are getting tired a lot faster.
At the point that this is oftentimes caused by obesity and bad diets, we think trans we think that trans fat ought be banned.
Our second independent point has to do with why this is a check on corporate interests, and we think that you ought protect the consumer.
We think it is true that people cannot internalize the risks of consuming trans fat.
First we tell you the impacts of trans fat are oftentimes very long-term or at least, unobtrusive enough until they culminate to a point where they are irreversible.
Let me paint these scenarios easily for you.
Either we have a situation in which people are consuming trans fat but they're not getting sick until they're thirty or forty, so the impacts on me as a child are not clear until I am much older, or I am a child and therefore don't control my diet and parents don't recognize what happens, or we think the problem is that because these impacts happen day by day, people don't notice the changes in themselves and cannot self-regulate.
More than this, we think that oftentimes these substances are incredibly addicting.
In the same way like cigarettes and sugar have been shown to have addictive qualities that keep us coming back for more regardless of the health impacts, trans fat is similar in that it stimulates the same kind of pleasure nerve endings that are stimulated when I'm smoking a cigarette or consuming something very sugary.
At the point that people can literally not control consuming more fatty foods because of addiction, we think it is on the part of the government to step in where they cannot.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"I'm proud to support the motion that we should ban targeted killing.
For the sake of this speech I'm going to focus on drone strikes but we're also open to other forms of targeted killing such as like targeted raids where for example, seal team six dropped in on osama bin laden's you know compound killed him and then immediately left.
So three independent points the first of which is that targeted killing is illegal and a violation of international law.
So specifically the thing that makes this legal in like US code is some like bizarre shenanigans around article fifty that let the CIA do way different stuff than the army.
But it's notable in that the army is completely restricted from this type of like one in and then leave immediately type of operation to the point where like the reason the army can do this now is because george w.
Bush made this like weird combined forces between the CIA and the army so that the army could start doing CIA stuff.
It is all very very sketchy in terms of its legal founding partially on a domestic bases but certainly on an international basis.
Like what we do in terms of drone strikes is flagrantly in violation of international law through the UN, in violation of the UN human rights commission.
Like this is all very very clearly delineated as something we are not allowed to do partially because of the sovereignty infringement issues that we are essentially attacking a country which we have not formally declared any sort of war against and oftentimes we are conducting attacks in country that have a sovereign and stable government such as pakistan.
But we secondly think that this is a legal issue that's complicated by the fact that there is actual like murder involved with this.
We think that a, often US citizens are killed in these attacks or at least rarely anyway which create significant complications but secondly, extra-judicial killings in general are bad.
We're not giving these people trials.
We're not giving them any sort of attempt to defend themselves.
Usually it is like a sum algorithm with like a computer in some CIA headquarters in this person sitting behind like the drone strike controller just like hits the button and it's over.
We don't think that this is fair.
We don't think that this is legal.
Our second independent point though, is that there is an ethical concern with regard to civilian casualties.
We think that this concern arises when you have like drone strikes that come down and you're supposed to be killing like one person in this marketplace and instead you just take out like sixty odd people that happen to be in the vicinity.
I think regardless of what your interpretation of the danger posed by this one individual is, it is definitely problematic to incur so much suffering on the part of innocents for the sake of taking out that one person.
Oftentimes I think you will see that terrorist attacks, particularly in terms of how it affects the united states, don't result in that many casualties.
Like nine eleven aside, there are like not that many deaths by terrorists on the yearly basis.
Given that, the innocent people that we kill alone in collateral damage through drone strikes vastly outweighs what these terrorists would be doing if we just did nothing right.
Like I think we are inherently causing more suffering than we are maybe alleviating.
But our third and final independent point from a strategic perspective these attacks are unproductive and the reason is the hydra effect.
When you take out a terrorist using a drone strike it creates significant collateral damage.
It raises anti-american sentiment.
Like regardless of what this individual pakistani's thoughts are on like the taliban or whatever terrorist group, they are now likely to be opposed to the UN US because they see the US as being responsible for the deaths of people that they knew potentially their loved ones.
This rise in anti US sentiment is often capitalized on by terrorist organizations who are looking to increase their recruitment rates, that in turn undermines the strategic goals of the US.
So even if you put aside like all of the like like moral like legal stuff, you still just have this like very pragmatic issue that is at the heart of drone strikes in the collateral damage they cause that is directly undermining US strategic interests.
Proud to oppose."
"We should further exploit unconventional oil.
So by this we mean things like shale oil, oil sands, tar sands.
And by we in this debate we are going to talk about liberal democracies around the world, because much of the oil that exists in this format is in countries like the united states and canada.
So three arguments for you.
The first is about cheaper energy costs.
We tell you that fundamentally there are two factors to the cost of energy: the supply and the demand, obviously.
Now.
The demand for energy is fairly inelastic.
People need gasoline and heating oil and things like that, the same amount, year to year, regardless of how much is available.
They can't just cut back freely, because it's so essential to our day to day lives.
So at that point when you increase the supply, demand will remain the same and prices will fall.
The effect of this is a better quality of life for your citizens, particularly those most low income citizens, who now free up a lot more of their money to spend on things besides gas for their car, and oil to heat their homes, and natural gas for their electricity.
So we think that you actually help your citizens by driving down energy costs.
Our next argument is about the political ramifications of exploiting unconventional oil.
So firstly we think that you weaken two actors who are contrary to the interests of the international community.
So opec, we tell you, is an oil cartel which exploits its position as having lots and lots of the world's easily extractable oil in order to prevent sanctions against member states, even when they're abusive, and require the US and other countries to support their interest abroad.
We think that if you produce more oil in countries like the US and canada, then you're comparatively less dependent on countries like, say, saudi arabia and venezuela, dictatorships who we think we don't want to support and don't want to depend on as democratic countries.
Sho you'll be more independent a very worst more reliant on the bulk countries like the US and canada.
We also tell you that you weaken russia.
Energy has been vladimir putin's main bargaining chip to keep the west from intervening in his adventurism in recent years.
So if you consider why the west hasn't done more to help ukraine or to prevent putin from intervening it in syria, we think that a large part of that is that european countries rely on russia for natural gas and for oil, they're one of the world's largest producers.
But if there is more oil available around the world then prices will fall, and it will be easier for the europeans to buy their energy elsewhere, and also the ruble as a currency will be less valuable which will make it more difficult for putin to run the country by buying off his people.
The last political effect we see that you get is more domestic jobs in the USA and canada.
These are countries that have faced a lot of outsourcing in the last few decades, so we think it would be good to bring lots more jobs, especially for kind of unskilled or uncollege educated workers, who might not have a lot of opportunities otherwise.
Our last argument is that you need to develop this technology at some point.
So recognize that we're running out of the kind of easy to drill oil that you see in countries like saudi arabia or kuwait right now.
These reserves are drying up and are getting more and more expensive to extract from, which means that in order to meet our energy needs in the future we're going to have to rely on unconventional oil.
So if we begin by developing the technology to extract that oil right now, while we still have cheap easy to extract oil, then it will be highly mature by the time that we rely on this for all of society to meet their needs.
So at that point we think that everyone would be better off in the future if we develop this technology now.
So for that reason we think we should further explore this type of exploit this type of oil.
We think that the other team might get up here and say that by exploiting this oil you discourage investment in green energy or otherwise hurt the environment, but we don't see why this has to be zero sum.
You could invest more in drilling for tar sands and things like that, and at the same time invest in wind power and solar power.
Energy investment is not zero sum, and we think that it is better to be prepared for all contingencies by exploiting the oil that we have available while we allow alternative energies to mature, so that we're actually able to rely on them without seeing a lower standard of living in the future.
Thank you."
"We should ban human cloning.
So we think it's simply the case that there are a massive amount of risks that come with allowing human cloning that come with allowing people to clone themselves or for corporations to clone other people with very little gains that can come from this.
Recognize that the process of cloning can still be tested under this model through other animals, that you can still produce organs in a number of ways.
In fact, organ production, human organ production is already being done in a number of different ways through a number of different methods that don't involve human cloning.
We simply think that is the case that there's no real game.
So why do we think that's the case?
If you create human agents you should treat that human agent as such.
What that means is that if you were to create a clone than that clone should be given the full rights of any other human agent simply by the nature of their humanity.
Just because they are a the same genetic makeup of another human being doesn't mean that they can't internalize the harms that will be placed upon them such as that other human being.
It doesn't mean that they don't have the right to their own autonomy, their own agency.
It doesn't mean that because they're derived from a method other than natural birth that they aren't still a human and deserve the rights that come with that.
What this means is that any if you were to create a human clone that human should be created as a new free individual but this is an incredibly costly process and given that the outcome of that costly process would be essentially the same outcome of giving birth we simply don't see any massive benefit to doing this.
Maybe there are scientific advancements you can gain but we don't see what scientific advancements you gain particular specifically through human cloning that you wouldn't be able to gain through learning about how cloning works in other organisms and other animals.
There's nothing about human biology that is so unique that we couldn't learn or get scientific breakthroughs through other methods of cloning but what you do get is you don't create a new human agent when you do cloning through other species.
We think other scientific knowledge knowledge can be gained from cloning animals but we simply don't think the massive cost of cloning a human is worth the outcome of creating a new agent but what we do think is likely to be the case is that if you were to put this cost in people would have some some sort of expectation of that cloned person.
We think there are a number of ethical qualms that come with cloning.
The first is a property right to a clone.
The question of who has property to a cloned individual is something that we think is likely to arise and along with identity problems that come with that clone.
The identity problems of the original person and of his clone knowing who they are and being able to relate to the world.
We think that that kind of psychological burden is unfair, not to mention the fact that there is now a property claim being contested between the original individual who has been cloned and probably the corporation or the lab that was to clone them.
We think there's a potential for organ farms which we think is incredibly problematic because if you were to create this high cost business of cloning human beings, we think it's likely that you'd want some sort of economic return on that and we can a very easy economic return is given the massive shortage in in the need for organ donations, we think organ farms are likely and again this would lead to human agents being stripped of their organs and used as a means to an end.
Something that we can see huge ethical problem and something that shouldn't potentially be allowed.
We also think there's a potential for human for for humans to have their rights stripped.
We think there's a massive potential that no matter what type of economic end you want to retreat from this, that whatever clone is the result of this process is likely going to face massive stigmatization, massive harms to their identity, and ultimately are likely to have their rights stripped to the point in which they are no longer human, but that doesn't mean that these harms wouldn't gather on that person.
It doesn't mean that this person this this clone wouldn't internalize the harms of such practices and given that these practices are likely to arise from such a process of human clothing cloning, we think we should cut it off at the head.
We think we should ban human cloning to to prevent these things from ever arising and for these reasons, we should ban human cloning."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should end the blockade on the gaza strip.
We mean by this is that currently israel has a permanent blockade in which they do not send any kind of aid across the border into gaza.
We think that this should be immediately lifted and that aid should start to be sent.
Three main areas of clash: the first on why it is unjust.
Recognize that sanctions are always internalized by those who are the poorest in that society those who are like automatically the most law-abiding citizens.
Why is this the case?
First, recognize that terrorists are always going to be able to get their resources elsewhere insofar as they're usually internationally connected and tend to have the ability to like traverse borders in ways that are illegal, that like that other citizens do not have access to.
But even if you don't buy that, we think that terrorists are often the most likely in most capable of robbing other citizens of their goods.
Insofar as terrorists have a vested interest in keeping each other and themselves fed and cared for, they will often go to the end of taking those resources from those who are most law-abiding in order to support themselves.
What this means is that sanctions are inherently undemocratic.
Insofar as those of, what those who are like least responsible for the situation are the ones who are most harmed.
Like, recognize that the majority of the gaza strip disagrees with hamas and is not a part of that organization.
The fact that they ought to suffer for hamas's sins is both unjust and incredibly detrimental to their personal health.
We think at the point that that's true then you ought not allow, that it is unacceptable to punish everyone for the actions of a few, especially in such an egregious way.
We think at the point that this kind of policy deprives the gaza people of resources, those who are already starving and deprived and torn apart by terrorism and war, then it ought not be added on top of that that they are deprived aid and necessary goods for their survival.
Our second area of clash is about why doing having this blockade actually encourages terrorism.
First, recognize that the existence of such a blockade allows hamas to play victim whenever they are asked by international authorities about the situation.
Right?
They get to say: "" look, israel is the one that is forcing this to happen.
They're the ones that aren't allowing resources to cross our borders.
We're just trying to govern our own cities but somehow we're not going to be allowed to do so "".
This both signals to the outside world that hamas is a victim, but more importantly, shows people living under hamas that that israel is the one who is actually causing harms.
We think that this is really problematic insofar as when you see israel as the inherent oppressor you are infinitely more likely to side with the terrorists that promise that they are going to fight against them.
It also allows hamas to be the only one providing resources.
We think that when israel says: "" hey, even though I am the state that technically possesses you, I will not provide you with life needing, or like life giving resources. ""
But hamas says: "" hey, look, they call us terrorists but we're the only ones giving you food or any kind of like provisions "", then hamas necessarily gets a leg up politically in terms of the view that citizens have of them.
We think the only way in which israel abolishes hamas is when they turn off the individuals that would become the constituents of hamas.
But when they are constantly creating those like support for hamas through in through the blockade, there is never any hope of destroying the terrorist organization at its core.
We think when every average individual within the gaza strip is beginning to build a hatred for israel because of the atrocities they feel have been committed against them, that's when you get massive amounts of terrorist recruitment, and that's when these people turn against israel forever.
But our third independent argument is about how it angers the international community.
We think that israel succeeds the most when it is seen as this like underdog being like oppressed by other communities, like can't like, the terrorists are after it, etcetera etcetera.
We think the moment that israel takes the side of the oppressor, or becomes the oppressor, that is when the international community starts to side with palestinians, starts to ask israel to give away land and start to like stop supporting them economically, and we think that's really bad.
So insofar as ending the blockade allows israel to reclaim the spot as as victim and thus garner more support, we think israel should end the blockade on the gaza strip."
"We're proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should introduce a flat tax.
In terms of the model we'll be applying this to both income tax, corporate tax, you know sales tax.
Everything will have flat rates obviously the corporate tax can be different than the income tax and the sales tax but we want to be clear that no matter what the size of the corporation is or the income that an individual makes they will always be taxed at the same rate.
Three independent points.
First is that this system is fair.
We think it is principally wrong to tax people more money just because they make more money or at least a higher percentage.
We recognize obviously that there is a need to tax people based on their means to pay but we think that a flat tax meets that need because you are paying a percentage of your income.
So obviously you know a person that is a millionaire twenty percent of their income is going to be you know more money than twenty percent of a significantly poor person's income.
This is important because we want our tax system to be fair insofar as the point of taxation is to you know take money into the states so they can provide services back to the people.
We think that especially when people you know are are the individuals having their money taken from them we think that they should get comparable amounts of services delivered back to them and disproportionately richer individuals don't receive you know a proportionate amount of services back from the state.
So we think it's principally wrong then that they are forced to pay disproportionately large amount of money to the state.
When you have a flat tax, that system is inherently fairer and inherently more you know consistent with the ways in which we construe the fairness of the taxation system in general.
Our second independent point is capital flight, that when you put onerous burdens on wealthy individuals in a state you basically create an incentive for them to move elsewhere.
This is seen for example in the decreasing population in connecticut right now which is absolutely unprecedented.
Generally you don't see populations decrease in a state but because the onerous burden that's put on the state's wealthiest individuals, you see essentially a system that incentivizes the richest individuals to leave.
Again this is principally unfair.
This is showing a disproportionate burden placed on them but from a pragmatic perspective it's also bad for the state apparatus.
It means that essentially the cash cows that are running the state coffers or at least fueling the state coffers are leaving and that's a problem for insuring a balanced budget because if your median income in your state goes down drastically because of the high tax rates you suddenly don't have anyone to pay for the services that are necessary like welfare or food stamps or what have you.
So if you basically crowd out all of your cash cows there's nothing left to keep the gears running.
Our third independent point is that it's harder to commit fraud under a flat tax.
So the current system is just absolutely wrong with loopholes and exemptions and all these things that are disproportionately you know something that works for the wealthy essentially because they can hire you know analysts and tax experts that will help them exploit all of these loopholes.
This in effect means that the tax system doesn't actually work particularly well for poor individuals right now because in order to compensate for the amount the extent to which we're sure people are utilizing these loopholes you have to just raise the base tax rate which in turn means that poor people are actually just paying a decent amount anyway.
We think that if you just take out then the loopholes and if you get rid of these exemptions and instead replace it with just a broad flat tax you can ensure that wealthy people are actually doing their part because they don't have these large systems to just take advantage of the loopholes and the ways that they can get around paying their fair share.
This in turn means a simpler system which also has its own benefits in terms of just being easier to understand, confusing less people, and meaning that they get in less trouble with the IRS and things like that.
Proud to propose."
"We should ban child actors.
When child labor laws were first being instituted in the united states, there were activists who said that banning child labor was essentially unjust towards children and a gross violation of the rights of parents and store owners.
This is clearly absurd.
Banning child labor allowed children to flourish in terms of their education, gave them more free time, and largely decreased the mortality rate among children, particularly from the ages of like middle school to high school.
However, when these laws were being drafted, certain contingencies and exceptions were put in place in order to fulfill or otherwise calm down the individuals who were pro-child labor.
One such exception was allowing children to continue to be actors in an abusive marketplace, essentially allow them to have their own resources abused by their parents.
We think that this policy is horribly outdated and as such, should be removed.
We support the following model, then, which is that there'll be no more child actors in any western state.
They'll essentially be banned outright.
We think that students should still be allowed to be in plays.
We still think that things thrown by their schools should be allowed, however, they cannot be paid for these sort of things, and the consumption of these plays must only be done through nonprofits, that is to say, you can pay for a ticket to go to a play that children are in but if it's not being thrown by a nonprofit, it will be made illegal.
Two arguments for why this is a good idea: first, we don't think that acting is meaningfully different from other work.
The only way in which we can have just government policy is if there are strong and meaningful philosophical pillars that support it.
When laws are arbitrary, when there is not a strong basis to the law itself, we think that government is able to express its will in unjust ways.
If they cannot meaningfully support a policy as being a benefit to the whole of society, it should not be put in place.
Why do we think that being a child actor is no not meaningfully different from other work?
First, there's no difference in consent.
Whether they're working the assembly line or whether they're a child actor, they cannot necessarily understand the implications of what they'll have to do.
They cannot understand the work day, how hard they might be pushed by the people around them, or even the dangers involved with the job.
As such, we think we are violating their rights when we push them to be child actors.
Second, we think it will always detract from education.
It doesn't matter if I'm spending all day in a factory or all day on stage, I'm still not learning.
We think that only the wealthiest child actors, those who are put in massive hits, get this sort of education on the side and as such, the vast majority of students are pushed out of schools when they become child actors.
We don't think you can form policy on just the best-off students.
You should always cater to the worst-off in order to protect them as they are the least likely protection from their own parents and industry.
Additionally, we think that parents are far more likely to ignore and exploit their children and abuse their resources and as such, there's no meaningful benefit to the children themselves.
My second argument is that the entertainment industry is particularly bad.
First, we think that many directors subscribe to abusive ideologies.
If you look at stanley kubrick, if you look at famous directors throughout time, they have used abusive tactics in order to get incredible performances out of their actors.
We think this is, on face, horrendous.
We think that harassing someone just to make "" the birds "" is not a just outcome.
However, when it's done to children, we think it's particularly bad.
The fact that abusive directors are essentially part of this continuation, part of a long lineage of directors who have continuously used their position to abuse their workers, is fundamentally unjust.
Additionally, we think that abuse, whether it be physical or sexual, is far more prevalent in entertainment as this is one of these spheres in which children are more likely to work and be coerced to follow the orders of an adult who is not their legal guardian.
As such, we should ban child actors."
"We should increase immigration to the united states.
In the status quo, we have a considerably less immigration then we should.
The current system is one in which we provide incredibly few visas provide very few permits to actually work in the united states and most people simply wait on a lottery system which will almost never select them.
This is fundamentally unacceptable and as such, we would support the following model.
That considerably more individuals should be allowed the united states.
That in all situations where someone would be allowed into the united states, we allow triple that number of individuals in.
We triple the number of people who get through in the lottery system.
We triple the number of HOne_b visas.
Basically, any way that you can get into the united states will be three times as easy to get in through that same system.
Three arguments why this is a good idea.
First, on the social effects of increased immigration.
Second, on the economic effects of increased immigration and third, on how this is an inherent moral good that we have an obligation to provide.
So first on the social effects.
We believe that individuals are less likely to be hateful, less likely to vote in favor of racist and problematic politicians, if we have increased immigration.
Why is this the case?
It is incredibly easy to hate the archetypal terrorist, hate the archetypal individual who's coming to steal your job, but when you meet someone from a country which you've formally seen as hostile, that is when you actually learn that they are decent human beings who deserve all kinds of respect.
This is the idea of contact theory.
When I engage with someone and their culture on a day-to-day basis, I am far less likely to hate them and far more likely to vote in favor of policies which actually help them.
Contact theory can come in a number of ways.
Increased immigration will put more individuals of diverse cultures in places of work, will also increase the number of buildings dedicated to things like worship, and increase the total number of food options available from a variety of cultures.
Once individuals begin to appreciate one another and respect one another as distinct but meaningful cultures that is when we see a massive decrease in hate.
We would also say that there will likely be better relations between states as immigration increases.
Why is this the case?
Hateful politicians, warmongers, who say that for instance in the united states someone said that they hate mexico, hated canada, hate any country where we get a number of immigrants in the status quo because of some perceived slight.
These individuals are far less likely to win office as such, we'll have respectful and happy politicians who are actually likely to pass good social policies for our state and for our neighbors.
This means that we'll have better relations, better trade, and generally happier society's overall.
My second argument is about the economic effect of increased immigration.
Recognize that in the status quo much of illegal immigration are individuals who tried their chance at the lottery system or tried to get into US through a legal way but were refused.
By tripling the number of people that we allow into the US per year these individuals will feel greater hope going through with the legal system and as such, will be less likely to illegally immigrate.
This means that we will save huge amounts of money on deportations and border security which is a massive sinkhole in the status quo.
Second though we think that there's a good economic effect as we increase the total amount of high skilled labor.
Most US immigration visas are offered because individuals have something to offer to the US.
This is why we offer HOne_b visas.
By increasing the total amount of skilled labor you increase the total amount of innovation, entrepreneurship, and the total amount of jobs overall.
But also we can increase the amount of low skilled labor as well.
There are many jobs in the US that individuals refused to fill simply because they are american and they believe they deserve a higher wage.
By increasing immigration these jobs will be filled and our economy will run considerably more efficiently.
My third argument is about moral good.
These individuals suffer from the lottery of birth.
That means they were born in a state that is less wealthy and have generally not caused US any harm.
They deserve to come in simply because the US has enticed them and caused harm in their state in the first place which is has pushed them out.
By increasing immigration we do a moral good at which we have an obligation to fulfill.
For this reason, we should increase immigration to the united states."
"We should abolish capital punishment.
We would say that capital punishment is never deserved within the criminal justice system.
That capital punishment is one form of punishment that cannot be warranted no matter the action you commit, and we think that this is something that is currently being done that is inhumane in our criminal justice system.
So that's what we're going to talk about in this debate.
First, why this isn't humane and second why people do not bear enough responsibility to warrant this as a proportional punishment.
Okay, aren't being inhumane: murders as an act is something that is fundamentally morally repugnant.
No matter what moral system you choose to adopt murder is something that we always view as a moral wrong.
It is always something that is only done as a last resort and maybe it can be balanced by certain actions, but it certainly isn't something that we would say is a positive good.
We think that there is, when you say that someone deserves capital punishment, you are saying that there is no value at all for the life of the person that has been convicted.
That there's no redeeming quality about this person.
That there's no chance of this person can be rehabilitated.
That there's nothing human about this person anymore.
There's no hope for this person.
We think that that intrinsically dehumanizes these people, and is a bad thing for the for the justice system to go out and start doing.
To start setting that standard.
It also forces another person to take the life of the convicted, which we think is forcing them to take a morally repugnant act.
And something that can be avoided through extended sentences.
Long jail time, even if you just wanna punish.
Finally, it repeats the cycle of violence that is likely being targeted for punishment to begin with.
It's saying: "" murder is bad.
Murder something that should not occur, and as a way to make it right, we are going to continue to murder. ""
We think that this is illogical at the very least, and as I've already explained dehumanizes people by saying that their life simply has no worth.
Finally, it doesn't give the chance for someone who's been convicted at rehabilitation and there's no way to undo this type of harm.
You can't appeal, you can't after a long period of time, if more evidence has come forward, you can't just let the person out.
You can't give them a chance to appeal because they're already dead.
It is an irreversible harm done by a justice system that is clearly fallible.
Maybe in a world in which the justice system is perfect, there's a justification for this.
But in the real world, in the world we live in, where the justice system gets it wrong all the time and bias is a part of decisions that are made by juries on a daily basis, to inflict capital punishment on someone is to simply ignore the facts of how often the justice system gets it wrong.
So secondly on responsibility: we think that capital punishment assumes full responsibility.
It says that that is a proportional punishment that was done because another person has killed someone else, and this is what is fair.
But we think that it is the case that the convicted is likely not fully responsible for their actions.
We think it is much more likely the case that a combination of their nature, what they were biologically pre predisposed to do, and the upbringing that they had is something that probably need them more likely to be violent.
Made them more likely to be in a situation where they would need to murder.
Where they would see that as an end that needed to be done and these are not things that anyone had any sort of control over.
What they were predisposed to do is not something that someone has any sort of meaningful consent towards or any sort of control over.
And this doesn't mean that they have no responsibility, but it means that they aren't fully responsible for the action they've undertaken.
And if they aren't fully responsible for that action then we think it was unjust for them to bear the full brunt of the crime, which is essentially what this does.
It is what capital punishment does.
It says: "" we are going to fully give you what you have done to another because you are fully responsible for what was done to that other by you. ""
This is not the case and this does not reflect the human experience, on top of the fact that the criminal justice system is fallible and it dehumanizes people when capital punishment is inflicted.
For all these reasons we should abolish capital punishment."
"Open primaries in the united states are advantageous.
So, by this we mean, first of all, regarding open primaries, these are votes to choose a candidate for a general election and they're run by the political parties, but if you have an open primary, then people who are not registered members of that party are free to vote.
If you have a closed primary, only people who are registered members of that party would be able to participate.
So, we're saying let people participate who aren't registered of the republicans or the democrats.
And by advantageous, we think what this debate really is about is which side better helps the party holding the primary to win more elections.
We think that the purpose of a primary ultimately is to get a candidate who will do well in the general election, so the thing that is more advantageous is the thing that will give you an advantage relative to the other party in the general election.
And we're going to demonstrate that by telling you how we get better candidates and why we think this process is more democratic and that's a good thing.
So, in terms a better candidates, we think that it's critical that a primary include moderates as much as possible.
The people who you need to sway in an american general election aren't your base.
If you're the republicans, you don't need to win over evangelical christians because they're going to vote for you anyway, they always do.
You need to win over white working-class people and other more moderate groups that could go to the democrats or the republicans.
Ultimately, only about a third of american votes are actually in play, so to speak, in a given election because about a third of people are republicans and about a third of people are democrats.
So, that remaining third is what the election actually comes down to and by having an open primary, you include more of those people in your primary because as moderate independents, they're not going to be registered as republicans or as democrats so they're more likely to actually participate if they're able to participate because it's an open primary.
So, therefore, your primary will better reflect the general election and you'll have a better sense of how popular your candidate will be when it comes time to have the real election in the fall.
So, we think that this is a really good way to ensure that your candidate has brought appeal and is going to appeal to the people that you actually need to win over to your side.
We also think that it's important that you reduce the power of radicals.
You want to avoid getting a candidate who's so far left or so far right that they can't appeal to moderates and the way to do that is to include more people who are moderates in your voting base because these people aren't going to pick someone in the primary who's too far left or too far right.
They'll pick someone who's close enough to center to be appealing to the american people as a whole.
So, we think you reduce the power of radicals in your party to actually hurt you by trying to pick someone who is ideologically good for them but not suitable for the general election.
So, we think that ultimately, you get better candidates and this is a huge advantage in the general election, so it's clear that you should use open primaries whenever possible.
Our second point is that we think open primaries are more democratic.
So, as I mentioned before, about a third of americans aren't republicans or democrats, which means that they're excluded from primaries in states like north carolina that have closed primaries.
So, we don't think that primaries in a state like north carolina are very democratic because millions of people who would be participating in the general election are not able to vote.
So, we think that if they're more democratic, then you're going to get more buy-in and more legitimacy because people will see that this actually reflects the will of the people and not just a plurality of the people that's relatively small.
We also tell you that candidates need a popular democratic mandate for legitimacy.
So, what I mean by that is that in order for a candidate to be seen as a good candidate and trustworthy, they need a broad base of people supporting them.
They need people of different races, of different socio-economic statuses, of different religions supporting them so that people don't think the candidate will be very biased towards one group of people.
And because you're including, ultimately, a much larger swathe of the population, we think that's going to be much easier to do with open primaries.
So, they're going to be more democratic and because of this, you'll see your candidate appears more legitimate to the american public.
So, for these reasons, I think it's clear that open primaries are advantageous."
"Teacher tenure reform brings more good than harm.
So I think that, when we're talking about this debate, it's important to keep in mind exactly which teachers we're talking about.
It seems to me that we're talking about primary and secondary educators in the united states, based on the information that we've been given, and on top of that we think that this is useful because these are people who receive tenure for educating, not for doing research like they would at a university, so we think that fundamentally if you're concerned about teachers, this debate is more relevant at the primary and secondary level than it is at the university level.
And on top of that, we think it's especially relevant in the USA because this is a hot button issue in many states there.
So that said, we could recognize that, while there are some drawbacks, we think that there is more good than harm done by reforming tenure, such that teachers with tenure can be fired or have their tenure revoked.
Two big arguments.
The first is about why we think you get better teachers.
So, recognize that right now you might have a teacher who does a really good job while they're at the beginning and middle of their career, and then once they get tenure they can phone it in.
Why would someone who knows that they will never lose their job regardless of performance because of tenure continue to work very hard in order to improve, when they're going to get hired anyway and keep their job anyway?
We think that you remove the biggest incentive for people to work hard.
It's not enough to offer them things like pay raises, you need to use the carrot and the stick.
The threat of losing your job motivates people to do the best that they can.
We also think that you're better able to reward the best teachers with promotions if you get rid of tenure.
Right now let's say you have a math department and you have two senior teachers and two intermediate teachers and two junior teachers.
If you're, one of your intermediate teachers is very very good at their job and deserves a pay raise and more respect, and one of your senior teachers is just phoning it in and not really trying, with tenure, you can't replace that advance teacher who's doing a poor job, which means that you can't reward the intermediate teacher who deserves to be rewarded with better pay, because you can't just create new positions when you have a limited budget, and now you can't promote them because you can't get rid of the person who's holding a position that they rightfully deserve.
So we think that you're better able to reward the best teachers and incentivize everyone to try to be the best teacher if you reform tenure.
So we think that you'd better create an impetus to improve when you reform the tenure system.
And that ultimately because the market is more competitive as people have to worry about losing their jobs, and as people have more of an incentive to try and try to continue to improve throughout their career, you will ultimately get better teachers, and have better education as a result.
So the second point is why we think this is better for students.
And I think this is a critical issue for this debate because if you're a state government and you have a limited amount of money and you have millions of students who need to get educated, obviously you wanna do what's best for these children.
The purpose of education is to help young people to gain the skills they need to be successful citizens, and you do that better if you reform tenure.
I've already explained why you get better teachers, and we think that if you have more qualified hardworking better teachers, then ultimately students are going to succeed more often.
Because if they're learning from people who are more qualified, more motivated to help them, then it seems likely to follow that they will be more likely to succeed and to do well in their education and go on to be more successful citizens.
But on top of that, when you have a limited budget to spend per student, we think that it's critical that you get the most bang for your buck, if you will, that you're getting the best value for the state's money.
And we think that tenure allows you to do that because you can fire teachers that are drawing in a lot of resources, like senior people if they're not producing according to what you're spending.
So we think that at that point we can get more bang for your buck.
You can do things like hire more teachers so that students get more one on one time with educators, or spend more money on special needs educators for students who need more attention or different attention in the classroom than their peers.
So at that point we think that you're likely to get better education for students with special needs such as advanced students and maybe disabled students or students learning english for the first time and other groups who need more attention.
But also that even average students who won't be getting this kind of specialized instruction will get more one on one time with an instructor because you'll be using your money more effectively and you can hire more staff.
So at this point, because you help more students, you're better fulfilling the purpose of education, and because you get better teachers to facilitate helping students.
So we think that teacher tenure reform brings more good than harm.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish double jeopardy.
Two main areas of clash, the first on the nature of our system of justice.
We think that a crime doesn't change, just because time has passed.
If I murdered someone fifty years ago, they are still murdered now, and the law remains the same, and the victim was still harmed, and the person is still dead.
We think that at the point, that new evidence comes out, maybe the jury was stacked, and we have reason to believe that there was an unfair acquittal, maybe there was a confession, or even the hundreds of years of new technology that we have acquired allows us to do things like DNA testing, and blood testing.
We think that the justice system needs to represent a need to adjust, to maintain what the original spirit is.
We think we have to acknowledge, that sometimes the trial system is imperfect, and the only way to solve this is by allowing something like double jeopardy to solve for these situations.
Because currently, the problem is that people, after getting acquitted once, and just setting up the right system of circumstances, hiring an expensive enough lawyer, any of these kinds of things.
Like, silencing enough witnesses means they get away scot free.
We think it is always a larger rights violation, to let someone go free than to put someone who is innocent through the trial process twice, because, in the end, if you are innocent, you are likely to be found so twice.
But, if you are guilty, you get to go free all forever after you're after you're tried once, under double jeopardy.
We think the impact of this is that, if if our justice system cannot be trusted, or is inconsistent, or allows people who are guilty to go free, due to things like the lack of double jeopardy, we think people are okay with flaunting the law, and losing trust in the system.
Things like OJ simpson getting away without any punishment, and then writing the book, if I did it, describing the crime and being like: yeah, I totally did it, are exactly the problem with our current society.
Criminals are okay with afterwards basically yelling to the world: look at the crime that I've committed, because they know they cannot answer it.
We think this decreases the general public's trust in the system, and decreases the efficiency overall.
Our secondary of clash has to do with victims' rights.
Because we think that when we're evaluating the justice system, we're working in a system of rights violations, and trying to compromise on who gets to be justified where.
And we think, the most important person in these situations is often the victim, because if someone has perpetrated something against a victim, they have violated their rights, and now owes a debt to them, and we because of what has been taken to them.
We think that a violation we have we think that it is important to be certain that that , that you are that the person, who you're letting go, is truly innocent, in order to fulfill your obligation to the victim and their rights.
We think, more than this though, that it is unlikely to be a system that is abused.
We think oftentimes resources are limited, and retrying the same person, over and over, is not only taxing to all those involved, but also incredibly monetarily consuming, and we just don't think that state legislatures have that ability.
Like, even if someone is incredibly racist, if they don't have the funds to amplify that racism, they're not going to retry the same person seventy million times.
More than this, we don't think that victims are going to push for this either.
At the point that someone has been found innocent once or twice, either they run out of money, or they ran out of the energy to do so.
We think it is important to recognize that, if a victim once closure, a second acquittal will oftentimes be enough.
But the problem, with allowing someone to not have to enter that second process in the first place, is that you are lacking the potentiality of closure at all.
We always think that the larger rights violation is on the side of having double jeopardy, we think that the only people who it protects are those who are guilty, and therefore it ought be abolished.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should adopt multiculturalism.
We think this could take a few forms, such as policies in public schools that mandate further education on multiple different cultures within history classes, we think that things like states not adopting a single language as their primary language, such as the current policy in the united states, all of these are ways of adopting multiculturalism.
Two main areas of clash.
The first on decreasing xenophobia and hate.
We think the problem when you don't adopt multiculturalism, in this that you pit cultures against each other and give one culture superiority over another.
What this means is that you never actually creating a world in which cultures are evaluated as equal, even though we think they probably ought be.
We don't think that there is something that inherently makes like the british, if we might call it a culture, something that is better than the culture of native americans, other than the fact that the british just had more guns, more weapons, and smallpox.
The issue with this the issue on their side of the house though, is that when you adopt a primary culture, you send the message that even though there is nothing inherently different that would make them better, in a state sanctioned sort of way there is.
We think part of the problem with this is that a way it prevents people from being able to appreciate other cultures to their fullest extent, and also erases those cultures' accomplishments.
This is as simple as me being able to appreciate different kinds of food, different kinds of artwork that come out of cultures, because recognize that when you are continually told that these cultures are subordinate to yourself, inferior, savage, or just unnecessary because yours is the only one that matters, you're not going to reach into and try to learn about them, you're not going to appreciate the kind of gifts that they give to humanity, because you see those gifts as something that is inferior to what you can provide.
But we also think this goes to a higher level.
It's a problem that in the united states, even though it is considered a multicultural country, we still never hear about the scientific contributions of the muslim world.
We think that this is partially due to the fact that people within the united states find islam to be a inferior culture to their own.
This erases the contributions of islam and muslims scientists to like science and other forms of other forms of like social good, and prevents them from being able to contribute as themselves.
We think this also also occurs on a personal level.
We think it's a problem that a lot of the time in the united states, immigrants feel like they have to assimilate to more white culture, because they feel like that is the only thing that is accepted and the only way they can do things like get jobs, the only way they can actively engage in society.
We think that what this does is prevents people from being able to accept their own identity and self-actualize on their own terms.
If I am taught to be ashamed of my own culture, if I am taught that it is going to always be worse, that my parents' accents are signs of inferiority, then I'm never actually going to be able to accept myself and function in that society on my own.
Our second area of clash has to do with why it's wrong on the part of the state to not accept multiculturalism.
We think that the state exists to be representative of the people that live under it.
We don't think that this this has an exception though, right?
Just because someone is of a different culture, doesn't mean the state has to not represent them, because in the end those people still pay taxes, still live under the social contract, still give up their rights in order to gain protections from the state.
We think that propping up one culture sends the message that this is who the state represents, which is fundamentally incohesive with what the state ought be doing.
We think that on a pragmatic sense, this is very isolating to the people who you are excluding from this conversation.
When you when the state does things like says like sends the message that they are representing one specific culture, other cultures feel like they cannot participate in the political sphere.
This leads to things like things like apathy, and future elections in which you never get a representative that actually represents the majority or everyone within that culture or community.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should limit the internet of things.
I think what we mean by this is that we would do things like require written warning labels on products, we would require companies to produce things internet of things to give out statements on what they are doing and what their privacy laws are and how that works on their websites, and would limit communication with servers and and limit the scope of wifi connection to necessary functions of that thing that we are talking about.
With that, two areas of clash, first on privacy.
Companies who can produce items can track and collect your data when they are doing it for the internet of things.
The problem here is that this deepens and exacerbates things like data mining that we are already experiencing the status quo.
Sure it's the case that google can do things like acquire my browsing history and my location data but it is unlikely that google can do things like figure out what my grocery list is, figure out my daily regime, what face wash I use if I like recently switched or bought it at a grocery store instead of on line.
Even in the current world of technology it is not the case that everything I do is in private.
It is also unlikely that the majority of the sites that exist in the status quo can obtain all of that data from me without at least some consensual input.
So for example, google will do google surveys because they recognize that their location data isn't a hundred percent accurate or you'll do things like fill out amazon thing amazon surveys so that they can recognize what things from your purchase history you're likely to buy again where you use regularly but these thing but things like the internet of things track all of this automatically and don't require your consent to send it to other people primarily because this is often written into the contract that you signed when you buy them.
So if you have a refrigerator that tracks what you've used up that's data that goes away goes to other groups.
This is either used by the companies themselves or sold to other companies who like specialize in data mining.
The problem goes further though because a lot of these companies can also eavesdrop or spy on your literal person and the problem is that this is like first a gross violation of privacy intuitively but if you need a rationale for that recognize that individuals value privacy as a right because it allows them to actualize as they prefer.
Sure we can imagine a world in which people just saw each other naked all the time and no one cared because we were desensitized to it.
The problem is that people do in part because we see our daily actions and our personal lives even if it inconsequential to the majority of other people as something that is important in central to ourselves.
So something is embarrassing but I think I'm being spied on even if I don't care who's spying on me even if it's someone who's a million degrees separation from me I'm still likely to censor my own behavior because I'm embarrassed.
We think that privacy is integral to personhood, so when things like connecting to the internet are able to strip that away from us entirely we care.
Our second argument is about security.
Recognize first that the internet things is infinitely more easy to hack.
The current rush to release objects that are connected to the internet is extreme but very few companies are able to adequately secure it.
For example just last year an entire power grid was shut down in ukraine that put a quadrant out for a couple of nights for electricity.
This was because even though manufacturers know how to connect things to the internet they're not completely clear on how those connections intermix especially since it is not the case that it is enough to just secure the item that you are selling but because everything is connected via wifi if any one thing is unsecured you are able to get into everything on like everything that you own and everything about yourself as a hacker.
This is why things like air gap products in the status quo is so important because even if one thing gets penetrated like my laptop it's not connected to the rest of my life so that person can't do things like control my light bulbs or my stove or other things that could be really dangerous to myself.
But finally when our third area of clash this has massive negative externalities.
When companies can decide what they're going to make their systems compatible with they can force us to buy different goods dependent on that, which to problematic monopolies and a lack of consumer preference.
Proud to propose."
"Holocaust denial should be a criminal defense first because holocaust denial is a hate crime and hate crimes should be criminal offences, and second because I think that holocaust denial making it a criminal offence carries a great deal of symbolic weight which is incredibly important for making a lot of vulnerable jews in places like europe, especially right now, feel a lot more secure.
So let's start by talking about why I think that holocaust denial just should be a crime.
I think that there's a reason why a lot of places in europe all in fact most western democracies, maybe not the united states because of its much stronger than most look rule rules on freedom of speech amendment protections.
Most places around the world have hate speech outlawed and the reason for that is because hate speech is designed to make people who live in any place uncomfortable in their own skin and feel uncomfortable going out and living their daily lives in the country.
That's hosts that hate speech.
Hateful speech is in a lot of ways an attack on someone's like identity.
I can hurt someone like emotionally in ways that is not so different from being physically punched in the face.
The way in which hate speech can truly rock your core and harm you is not something that should be understated and the reason why hate speech is outlawed.
So why do I think that holocaust denial is particularly a kind of hate speech that is definitely should be recognized and is definitely very pernicious, and this is true because holocaust denial is just a slap in the face to the millions of jews that were executed by a horrible regime and moreover the descendants of those people who still live in europe to those days and the people who like carry on the like jewish legacy.
To deny the suffering that was a part of the holocaust, to deny the tragedy that was the holocaust, trying to wipe it off the face of history, is just try to overlook the oppression that essentially jews had to face and it's all the hardships that jews had to face and that's absolutely not somethng that you should do because it's just like ignoring an absolute aspect of their lives and it's really demeaning to say that the like suffering of your people isn't something that actually happens, something so blatantly factually inaccurate it's in a lot of ways an attack on jewish identity and it's attack on jews because it's a way to try to make them feel lesser.
It's a way to try to make them feel vulnerable again and that's absolutely not something that should be protected.
It's absolutely something that should be criminal.
But, additionally I also think that there is a huge symbolic element here and I think that when a government makes holocaust denial a criminal defense criminal offence, this is something that isn't going to go unnoticed and this is something that carries with it, since the force of the law has carried with this as a criminal offense, this is going to make a lot of people feel a lot safer even if this doesn't actually lead to less holocaust denial.
It's going to make people feel more supported by the government and people feel more comfortable with the government.
So first and foremost, if you like want people to stay in a lot of these countries that's necessary like a lot of jews emigrate from places like france to israel because they don't feel safe in france because of upticks in hate crimes and anti-semitic crimes, so on that level if you like want to keep jews in your country, if you want to keep a diversity religious diversity in your country, that's important.
But like on the basic citizen on the basic citizenship level you should be trying to afford rights to these people so they feel included, so they feel protected, and this is incredibly important because I think that symbolism matters.
Like when when like the confederate flag is allowed to fly outside of a state house in south carolina you don't feel accepted by that government but when that is taken down or if wouldn't it be great if the confederate flag could be something almost associated with criminal activity.
That would certainly make the people who have suffered you know a lot more safe and a lot more supported by the government.
This is a basic way in which symbolism does matter and symbolism actually affects people's lives and makes them feel safer.
So for all those reasons, holocaust denial should be a criminal offence."
"The motion for today's debate is that boarding school should be abolished.
Two main areas of clash: the first on why it's bad for the children that go there.
We think forced first and foremost it's bad to be away from parents that early.
We think that parents play a role in children's lives that is very different and more integral than any other relationships that they can build.
Insofar as that my relationship with my parents influences the way that I see the world in the future.
Whether or not I was unconditionally loved, whether or not they listened to my problems, whether they were demanding or not, all of these things change the way that I interact and form relationships in the future.
We think removing parents from the equation too early actively prevents children from being able to create healthy relationships in the future, because they never had the first one that they modeled off of.
Many psychologists have talked about the impact of parents and children.
Whether it's maslow, horny, freud, and all of them have said that in order for healthy relationships to develop, exposure and early exposure is most important.
Second, we want to talk about why this binds students to activities in a way that other schools don't.
We think the cool thing about public schools and schools in the area is that if a child doesn't necessarily like all the activities there and wants to do something extra curricular, they can leave the grounds of the school and go find that elsewhere.
The problem of boarding schools is that children are bound by the ideology of that school.
So, if my parents sent me to a very conservative boarding school, it doesn't matter if I want to do art on the weekends or go do something else, because I am bound to the grounds of that school and cannot leave.
We think this actively prevents children from being able to self actualize, but more so forces them to be in communities that maybe they feel uncomfortable in and can never find an outlet from.
We think this is further corroborated by the higher rates of bullying oftentimes found in boarding schools.
Because there's very little oversight, especially in situations that there's dorms or extracurricular activities.
Boarding schools are often festering pools where students can take power from other students by being bigger, older or stronger.
Higher rates of hazing are also oftentimes present.
We think what this means is that oftentimes students are not just stuck to activities they don't like, but stuck in environments that are actively unsafe and unhealthy for them.
Because you can never leave your leave the situation which you are being bullied in insofar as you are stuck on the grounds of the boarding school, stuck in the dorm that you live in, you're constantly told or bullied that you are like worse than them, and we think that this is incredibly bad for children.
Our second main area of clash is why it's bad for society.
We think that boarding schools are often expensive and the amalgamations of wealth become echo chambers for certain schools of thought.
These kids grow up, and growing up in a boarding school often means that I have more, like oftentimes specifically means that I have more conservative or republican views.
Like probably my family had money and insofar as they sent me away to areas where there were large large amounts of people from similar backgrounds to myself, I never hear other points of views.
We think what this means is that boarding schools are infinitely more likely to have racism and sexism perpetrated throughout them.
Because in boarding schools where it's like, same sex boarding schools especially, women are even more likely to be objectified in commodified because there's never a voice to say this is not what this is for, and children are allowed to grow grow apart from like parental oversight, or from very much oversight.
We think they go into society with the views that their boarding school instilled in them and these views are often difficult to take down.
We think we see this often times when children from boarding schools go into the real world and recognize that suddenly there surrounded by different forms of culture, different genders, and have to start interacting with them, but they've always been stuck in a situation where they didn't have to, and necessarily were taught to think less of them.
Finally, we think this fast tracks the students for colleges and networking in a way that is disproportionately unfair.
Just because my parents couldn't afford a boarding school doesn't mean that I should be put at a disadvantage to someone whose parents could.
We think abolishing boarding schools also abolishes this idea wherein you can just buy your college acceptance a little bit.
Obviously will never get rid of all the benefits but you can like prevent at least this one.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"We should abandon online dating services.
So in this round, we don't think that we're going to make these things banned.
We're not going to put some legislation forward that would ban online dating services.
We just think that the stance we need to take is that, as an individual, you should not use online dating services, that other ways of trying to find a potential match are better, and that online dating services are generally problematic.
So, two arguments under this: the first is about untrustworthy connections, and the second is that there're just better means of finding connections than through online dating services.
So, the one of the biggest problems with online dating service is that many of them are filled with false presentations, and what this means is that, online, you can pose as whoever you want, and people are able to put up profiles of themselves that match their best qualities or even match qualities that they wish they had within themselves in order to attract people of a certain type.
This is especially likely to happen on online dating sites because of that, because people have a certain type of person in mind they want to connect with, and they form a profile around that ideal rather than trying to just match with someone that is most likely to could be to be interested in the type of person they really are.
People go in with certain expectations and try and have those expectations met.
This is a compounding problem, where most profiles are fake or massively misleading.
This isn't just an issue with a few people going onto these sites and building out these erroneous profiles, but most people who go onto these sites, and not even out of erratic or or nefarious desires, but simply because they want to find someone that matches what they believe to be the best version of themselves.
You want to put out the best version of yourself you can think of and often exaggerate and massively hyperbolize those qualities about yourself.
This simply does not accomplish the goal of a dating site, which is to find someone that you're compatible with, that you could spend a long you you form a long-term relationship with.
These things don't don't meet those standards.
The other problem with these false presentations is they can be potentially dangerous.
People can do very bad things when they try and connect with someone through these online dating services, especially if you meet with someone in a private space, in a space where there aren't other people around.
And not having that background, aside from some online interactions, maybe a phone call ahead of time, can really put people in danger when these people put fake profiles up for nefarious purposes.
Given that this is the case, we think that there are just better alternative, safer alternatives, that people go for.
So, what are these other alternatives?
Well, firstly, if you want to be online, we think other online communities are probably better.
When you're not in a sphere where people are trying to put out a personality of themselves that matches a potential partner, but you're on an online forum for a community that you're interested in, or you're in a chat room or something like that, when you're in these types of communities, these are probably better online spaces for meeting a potential spouse or a potential partner because you already have a common point of interest, because you already are in common social spheres.
It's more telling of yourself than just putting a profile out there that you can lie about.
We also think that you can have connections through mutual friends.
What this does is allow other people, who know you well, to match you up with someone that is more likely to be someone that you connect with, because they have a more personal connection to you than these online dating services ever will.
You can also have a connection with people in a work space or a school.
There are many opportunities to learn people to to learn about people and to meet people in these settings, especially because these are the people that probably have common interests with you, because you're in these spheres, again.
And finally, you can connect with people through social groups.
If you're in school, if you're doing extracurricular, or if you're just an employed adult who's going out and going to certain clubs, or joining certain groups, or participating in certain rallies or political movements, these are all areas in which you can meet people, not necessarily go into with the idea of meeting people for a romantic encounter, but meet people nonetheless, who share interests with you, who you can have a background check on to know that they're safe and they're not nefarious, and who are much more likely to be compatible with you than whatever a dating site tells you.
For these reasons, we should abandon online dating services."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban factory farming.
Three main areas of clash, first on why it is animal abusive.
Recognize that factory farms treat animals awfully.
They keep them in tiny enclosures, they feed them terribly, they are killed painfully and often in front of each other and like if we kept humans in any kinds of these states it would instantly be considered a human rights violation and whoever was doing it would be tried in court.
So we think that animals might not be as smart as humans so we understand if some would not describe the same level of rights to them but they do feel pain and they suffer similarly so we probably shouldn't cause that suffering that so closely mimics our own.
Like we think at the point that eventhough like babies or really old people with dementia or anyone with a mental illness isn't as sentient or as intelligent as a human being, we don't say like oh because of that we value your rights as less and can treat you like garbage rather we actually see them as deserving of more protection, we see them as vulnerable groups and so we think that animals are actually incredibly similar and we shouldn't be causing them such pain.
But I also think that there's like a higher order pain verses lower order pleasure thing here, right?
Like recognize that these animals are suffering indefinitely like it takes up their entire life it's a really big amount of pain for them whereas for us it's just like this tiny pleasure of being able to cheaply afford meat and we just don't think that it ever compares, like we think that my higher my lower order pleasure is not worth their higher order pain is not worth the fact that they suffer so much as compared to like me only being happy a little.
Our second area of clash is about why it's human abusive.
Recognize that factory farms breed human breed terrible working conditions for their workers.
They are part of large corporations that lobby for less regulations and loss oversight, they often employ illegal immigrants that they won't be able to complain about the conditions so they can be worked even harder and have even like worse worse materials and worse like other conditions and it also like breeds medical catastrophes in a lot of ways like you're working around copious amounts of animals that are all with their own bacteria and own diseases and so it's like and you're also working on a lot of sharp stuff so it's actually a lot of the time really dangerous to work in these areas and it's not uncommon for individuals to lose parts of their hand or like other parts of their body because it's been cut off.
So we think at the point that factory farms are so especially bad for people and this doesn't occur on smaller farms for the simple reason of like it not being as overcrowded, there being more oversight like more regulations occurring we think this is actually like a very bad thing and this is another reason they ought be banned.
But our third argument is about why this is really bad for the environment.
Recognize that methane emissions alone cause a massive portion of like global warming and global energy increase and like the reason these methane emissions are so high is because we're growing hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of cattle to meet the rising demands of individuals and so we actually think that that's like quite bad right like we think that individuals can do without their cheap meat but we probably can't do with a world that is steadily growing too hor for us to exist on so and insofar as the only way that we prevent those emissions is by cutting down on the amount of animals that we have banning factory farms is a really good way to start because it would never allow such a large aggregation of animals in one place again.
They also use up massive amounts of water because you need both the amount of water to grow animal feed and then you also need to give water to the animals so that they could drink and at the point that we are facing like large amounts of droughts sweeping different areas like we're running out of water actively, water is getting more expensive in a lot of areas that charge for water we think that we should be prioritizing people getting water verses some people getting meat and those animals having to get water.
So we think this is also bad in that regard.
So we think that like end result is we bite the harm we think that it's that prices are going to rise dramatically like all this will get less expensive, but we think that's fine because less of this meat should be consumed and those effects of less meat consumed are good.
Proud to propose."
"We should not subsidize single parents.
Although single parents need help, it is not simply because they are single parents.
It is usually because they don't have enough money, they don't have enough time, to actually help their children.
That being said, we would say that single parents largely have the capacity to get other forms of welfare or they simply don't deserve welfare at all.
It is largely unclear why a lawyer single parent deserves additional money from our society simply because they are a single parent.
To that end, we would propose the following model: that no unique subsidies go to single parents and that single parents can get things like welfare but not simply because they are a single parent.
This leads me to my first argument about how we should be subsidizing broad groups of people rather than simply more niche groups.
We think that it is only good to subsidize a group if the very condition that we are subsidizing will inherently make them worse off.
What do we mean by this?
If someone is in poverty, they clearly need money.
No ifs, ands, or buts about it.
If someone does not have enough money to feed themselves and get shelter, giving them more money will help them live better.
However, we think that if someone is a single parent, they may be incredibly wealthy, they may have inherited their money, maybe working towards their money, either way it is unclear why individuals who may be making less money than them who may need to leave their children alone for even longer because they're working multiple jobs should subsidize these single parents.
Instead of doing this, we should be funding the groups of individuals who need the money the most.
We would say that money is also fungible so every dollar that we give towards a single parent who does not deserve that kind of money is a money that's taken away from the individuals who need it the most.
Secondly though we think there's no obligation from governments to fund individuals who are single parents.
When someone's been in poverty, it is in many ways due to societal factors.
The likelihood that someone will end up in poverty after being born in poverty is incredibly high.
Additionally, the government has taken active steps to keep certain people in poverty.
Union busting and through the nineteen fifties and forward, redlining for people of color where they simply cannot get jobs in good areas, there have been a variety of practices where government has continued poverty simply because it benefits the richest in our society.
The same cannot be said about single parents.
It cannot be said that the government has actively fought to make single parents in the condition that they're in.
We would say that they largely can't be blamed for these sort of conditions either but it is unclear why the government which is made up of people should have to spend their money in order to help these sort of individuals.
Given that there's not a reciprocal obligation to help these people, that is to say there's no way in which other people have been enriched simply because these people have been made worse off, there's no obligation then to give them additional social benefits.
My third and final argument is about how child support solves.
We think that child support is not enough in our in our current society.
If someone runs away from the child, that is to say puts all the obligation on a single parent, they should have to pay a huge amount of their income to their former partner.
We would say that if someone is even if someone's in poverty they should have to pay the vast majority of their welfare the vast majority of the additional funds that they get to their child.
We would first say that this will incentivise people to stay longer which is generally a good thing.
We'd secondly say though that these are the individuals who caused the harm in the first place.
If these individuals are unwilling to support their child financially, unwilling to take joint custody of their child, they should have to pay increased money.
Obviously this doesn't solve every case that is to say if someone's a widow, if someone simply doesn't have a partner anymore, however we would say that if they are poor we can give them more money through that kind of welfare and if they're a rich widow they can just hire more childcare workers either way.
For this reason we should not subsidize single parents."
"Intellectual property rights are the protection of things you create for a limited amount of time.
This includes everything from songs and catch phrases to life-saving medicines.
The government already recognizes that intellectual property rights should not last forever, and it already recognizes that there are caveats to intellectual property rights, such as the fair use act, where if you're using something to critique it or satirize it, that would be allowed.
Ostensibly, intellectual property rights are protecting economic growth because it's hard to keep inventing and creating if your creations can be copied.
However, we think that pretending the creations belong to any one person or corporation is absurd, and the government needs to abolish intellectual property rights to encourage growth and to encourage creation and to allow for life-saving medicines to really save lives, instead of just turn a profit for a company.
So first of all, we think that creations are almost always an amalgamation of work.
We think that taylor swift might have done a lot of work for her songs but when we say that she owns her intellectual property rights over her songs, we are ignoring the fact that hundreds of people worked on the creation and they are not getting fair remuneration for what they have done.
We think that it puts the spotlight on one specific person in an unfair way that ignores the fact that there are usually many more people involved in the process of creation than is being rewarded by the intellectual property right patents.
We think that that's a problem that is not addressed under the current law, and when we abolish intellectual property rights, it will be more it will be more there'll be more fair recognition for the people involved in in creating different products.
We also think that natural resources owned by the state are often used in creating intellectual property, whether we're talking about artists who are inspired by nature or medical research companies that use plants and animals to test new theories or even grants that are given to artists and to corporations in order to to create new products and new and new material.
We think that natural resources belong to the people of the country, and we think that it is only fair that they are also allowed to reap the benefits of it, without having to pay exorbitant prices set by these companies, corporations and artists, in order to view their work or benefit from their products.
We think it's very difficult to say who things really belong to, and allowing a narrow group to reap such huge rewards is a problem and it's wrong.
We also think that it limits new creations by causing fear of inspiration.
Your fear, your corporations, companies, new scientists, new research proposals and artists are always in fear of being sued by other companies or other artists, and are limiting themselves in their new creations and they're limiting what they could be doing for fear of being sued by other companies and being told that they are copying or infringing on intellectual property rights.
We think that this negates the problem of the that that it's absurd to think that there's only more growth from intellectual property rights.
We think that it, in fact, limits it to a great extent by causing fear in in different industries.
And finally, we think that in many industries there's an even bigger problem, one of exploiting one of exploiting these rights to make a profit at the expense of others' lives.
So we have a lot of life-saving medicines and other types of medicines that could alleviate pain, this is particularly in the medical industry, where we could be alleviating pain from people, saving lives, and yet these are medicines that are marked up by hundreds of percents by companies in order for them to turn a quick profit before time runs out on their intellectual property rights and and generics and generic medicines flood the market.
We think that lives are lost in in the pursuit of greed when we have intellectual property rights in the way that they are today.
We think that this property is questionable to begin with, because we think that more people deserve recognition for the work that goes into the products and for the and the creations that are made.
We think that in order to encourage creativity, growth, and to save more lives, we should abolish intellectual property rights."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should end athletic scholarships.
For the model we're comfortable defending an outright ban through something like a government policy.
We would say that this is something that is applied universally just for competitive say like this can be applied in a global scale just like through individual government saying you know we're going to do this.
Three independent points or two independent points sorry.
First, that it harms universities and second, that it harms athletes.
So on the first point that universities are harmed under the status quo, we would say that cash is zero some.
That the university only has so much money that it can spend on so many things.
This is pretty objectively a bad use.
Athletic sports teams don't really bring that much money back into the university because you wind up spending so much of it on things like fields and coaching staff and equipment meanwhile, there are other things you can use it on like lab space or things that actually benefit students learning that are just objectively better ways to use your money.
We think the primary obligation of a university or just in general a place of higher learning, is to educate its students and it has a proactive obligation to the students that pay lots and lots of money to go to that place to actually provide a meaningful educational experience to the greatest extent possible.
Like even if in the status quo a lot of these places are capable of providing quality education, we think there's always more that you can do.
There's always better library amenities you can provide.
There's always you know more teachers you can hire thus enabling smaller class sizes.
There's more lab space that you can build thus enabling better research to occur on your campus.
There's always more you could do you and there's practically no roof on that.
That means that athletics are probably a bad way of sinking money and when you give the scholarships out you are spending lots and lots of money on this thing.
On our second point that the policy harms athletes, so right now athletes have to spend a lot of time practicing basically to get these scholarships and then to maintain these scholarships.
The problem is that studying and practicing both take time.
There is a zero sum analysis that an individual has to make based on whether or not they're going to study or practice at any given moment and the more they practice the less they study.
That's a problem because not everybody goes professional.
Not everyone gets into the NBA or the NFL or the MLB or whatever.
So when you in are part of the large group of people that inevitably doesn't get into the major leagues, you are poorly equipped post college.
This is true for a couple reasons.
First, holding your scholarship is contingent on you sinking a lot of time in college into this.
You have to be an extremely active member of the team and dedicate the majority of your time to it otherwise you lose your scholarship and you won't be able to continue going to the university.
Second, you have to waste a lot of time in high school getting the scholarship.
That means that basically you are trading a lot of your studying time for practice time to get into a school that's probably not significantly better because you did make this trade off and in exchange you have learned less because you've spent less time on your academics.
Third, without the competitiveness there is still equality in the admissions process.
So think of it like this, if you don't use the athletic scholarships the competitive incentives to push ahead in high school and get these scholarships dissipates.
That means that no one is getting ahead of each other.
Basically we use this institution, athletic scholarships, to get ahead of our peers in terms of the college admissions process, but everyone in the athletic sectors using it.
So if nobody was using it it would still be that same level of competitiveness amongst athletes.
So the problem then, is that you are expending a lot of money and doing something that creates a lot of harm in order to get an unclear benefit.
You get a landscape that is equally competitive just with higher stakes and more money wasted.
Proud to propose."
"Astrology brings more harm than good.
So we think that in this debate of course neither side is going to be able to prove that astrology is the best or worst thing in the world, but we think that we're going to be able to tell you that on balance it does more harmful things than good things and that that's how you ought judge this type of debate.
And by astrology of course I mean things like horoscopes and the zodiac and all of those type of things.
So our first point is that astrology encourages a poor way of thinking.
The state and society in general spend a lot of money teaching young people to think like scientists.
They learn about the scientific method in school, they learn to be critical of information presented by the media, or by science and other places like that, ultimately so that they are able to make their own decisions about what seems reasonable based on the evidence available in the world around them.
Yet at the same time many people believe in astrology which is obviously not supported by evidence, and which often flies directly in the face of science.
We think that this therefore challenges the notion that it is important to be critical as a thinker, and the notion that people should believe in evidence based science rather than non evidence based faith, and we think that this can be confusing for young people and ultimately could lead to an anti-scientific view point.
And we think that when people have an anti-scientific viewpoint they're more likely to do things like think that vaccines cause autism and not vaccinate their children or to believe in unproven alternative medicines that don't work or might actually be harmful.
So we think that we would prefer a world in which everyone had a more scientific way of thinking and that in that sort of world astrology wouldn't exist.
In our world it is only doing a harm by discouraging this scientific way of thinking.
Next we think that astrology discourages personal responsibility.
Now obviously not everybody checking their horoscope is completely ignoring their own responsibility for good and bad things that happen in their lives, but if you think, on some level, that the alignment of the stars determines if something good or bad will happen, we do think that you're less likely to take ownership over the events in your life.
We think that it's more likely for instance that if something bad happens to you that you won't take responsibility but rather that you blame it on your horoscope and that this is particularly true for day to day events.
We think therefore that astrology is a way for people to avoid taking personal responsibility.
And in a perfect world we would want everyone to always take responsibility for their actions.
To own up to them and to believe that they can try to improve and get better over time by taking responsibility for their actions.
So in that type of a world astrology very likely wouldn't exist.
So we see that, again, it is doing more harm than good even if it's not a massive harm or a harm that fundamentally changes everything about the world.
Lastly under this, we think that astrology encourages people to have unrealistic expectations for their lives.
We think that in general people's lives don't change for the better without lots of hard work, we think that luck is really overstated.
So when horoscopes and astrology in general tells people that, well, you might have a really good month if the stars align in a certain way, that probably does set people up with unrealistic expectations and we think that when those expectations aren't met that people are likely to be disappointed and ultimately that we would prefer that not happen if people just didn't believe in astrology and avoided this disappointment and these unrealistic expectations.
So for our second point we'd like to weigh the potential good and bad of astrology a little more explicitly.
The other team is likely to tell you that astrology gives people hope for the future or that if their life is going poorly, belief that it will get better.
But this is a false hope and there's no reason to think that their lives will get better without something changing in the real world.
So we think it ultimately astrology is peddling a lie and we don't think that that's going to really help anybody.
And next they might say: "" well, astrology is harmless fun. ""
But we think that even if this is normally the case it does certainly encourage a less scientific world view and encourage people to take a little less personal responsibility.
So on balance we think it's a bad thing there as well.
For these reasons we think that astrology brings more harm than good.
Thank you."
"The motion for this debate is that we should adopt socialism.
So, for a quick model, we think that in a social generally socialist country, most of large corporation and the means of production are heavily regulated by the government with regards to how much they have to pay in the minimum wage, with regards to their taxes are being very high, and with regards to environmental codes, etcetera.
There would also be a system of public healthcare similarly to that of canada, a system of public education with no private schools, and high very high taxes that would account for high amounts of welfare, especially social security for those who are old or those who are poor, and as well as like free like better social security and free healthcare.
So two main areas of clash, the first on capitalism requiring continuous social inequality.
Because it requires a class system since in order to have like a capitalist system, you have to be able to motivate people to move up from where they currently are, to work hard and be productive, and you just can't do that unless you have a class system.
Also, when your goal is to make money, it creates an incentive to make a lower class that will take lower wages so that you can make more money.
So, capitalist systems actually create incentives that make some people screw over others in order for them to make more money, which essentially creates the class system in the first place.
It also creates an incentive to keep them poor for continued, and so you don't have more competition with being rich.
So we think that a lot of the time what capitalism requires is for people to not just make others poor and stay in poverty, but to stay in poverty for continuous periods of time because it's just easier to exploit the same family for generations than wait for someone to drop down to poverty.
And when if they do move up, it's now someone who's competing with you.
It's this is incredibly problematic because it means the system relies on people struggling, starving, and generally suffering.
But there's no reason that these people should struggle.
First, it's definitely not just or fair.
People are born into classes that predispose them to failure, even though there is no moral difference between them between them and someone richer.
So, in many of these situations, you have people who are born into a lower like into like families in poverty and then, because the school is crappy, because people are biased against them, they can't actually break out of that class system, no matter how hard they work, even though it was completely arbitrary a lottery of birth that they were born into that family and someone else was born into a richer family.
But even if you don't believe that, it's also completely unnecessary.
There are enough money and goods in the world for everyone to be comfortable, but currently there are too many at the top that own all of the money and all of the resources.
The problem is that they would still be fine if they shared a little bit with those who are lower down.
Our second area of clash has to do with capitalism pragmatic harms.
First, there's the simple issue of larger death counts and suffering.
Millions of people are homeless, living in food deserts, don't have jobs, and socialism doesn't have this because it redistributes wealth to avoid these kinds of situations.
We prefer for some to be less well off while thousands more are better off and can actually survive, rather than rather than the status quo.
Also, capitalism equates value and markets.
The system where people get valued based on how much the system of capitalism values people based on their productivity, based on how much they earn.
This intrinsically values those who earn less as less worthy, less value of an individual.
This means that people treat them less like a human, they're less willing in capitalist systems to provide them with money for basic needs.
This is why we have republicans who get up there and say that these people are just asking for handouts, even though in reality they're just people who are struggling to get by in a society that put them there in the first place.
We also think it's important to remember that it's that capitalism is actively untenable in the long term.
There's a changing world where AI is becoming increasingly popular and is much more likely to get rid of millions of jobs, but not just white-collar jobs in which people are like working as like burger flippers or waiters the like things that are easily automated, but also a lot of higher level jobs in data analysis.
And at the point that people will literally not be able to get jobs because so many of them are taken up by robots, we think it's unjust to maintain a capitalist system that is going to put all of those people down into poverty.
This creates more violence and unrest in these societies as well which is also a problem.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should protect endangered species.
So, when we're talking about protecting endangered species, we think of a few things in particular.
Firstly, we would obviously institute prohibitions on hunting, so if an animal is on the endangered species list, we would say that there should be laws against being able to hunt that animal, and of course very stiff penalties that come with breaking those laws, to ensure that if they are broken that there's deterrence against people doing it in the future.
We would also have investments in reservations and sanctuaries in order to ensure that for animals, especially those where their environments are being continually destroyed by globalization, by industrialization and by climate change, that there are sanctuaries guaranteed for these animals so they can live in their natural environments, where they're able to grow and be healthy and actually live in the way where they are naturally meant to be, and this could include investing in having large swaths of land in order to invest in preserving these animals' environments.
Okay.
So firstly, we would say that animals should be given human rights.
We think that rights need to be objective in order for them to be enforceable.
What we think the reason for this is that if rights are based on arbitrary standards, for example if I arbitrarily decide that animals should be excluded because they're not human, allowing for arbitrary distinctions in who can and cannot serve rights, opens the door for allowing any sort of arbitrary distinction.
It can allow for arbitrary distinctions based on race, on gender, on other types of things that are immutable to an individual, in the same way that the species that an animal is is immutable to what it is.
And given that this is the case, we think that having arbitrary system of rights, non-objective systems of rights, ultimately lead to people that we care about or should care about being harmed.
In order to avoid this, we think that an objective way to look at rights is is through rights being the system to avoid pleasure and pain.
We think that ultimately rights exist for those two primary purposes.
If you ask why people should be given the right to life, why they should be given the right to bodily autonomy, the answer is ultimately that it having those types of rights is likely to minimize the pain that that person experiences and maximize their pleasure.
Animals are capable of experiencing pain and pleasure in deep ways.
There the stimulus of pain and pleasure somewhere in animals as it is to humans, and they can be knowledgeable of the pain they are facing, they can even come to fear that pain in the future.
There are also, if you don't think that the pain pleasure principle is is important and you would base it on things like consciousness, animals are often capable of building communities, having empathy, collective collective learning, and other human traits.
So we think that animals, based on objective standards which everyone who choose to use, deserve to have right.
So, we and so the second reason that we think we should protect endangered species, aside from the fact that they have rights and they need to be those rights need to be preserved through protections, is that we are responsible for them being endangered in most instances.
Human expansion and industrial development cleared whole ecosystems and crowded out other species.
It led to massive declines in species on a global level, and on top of that, things like climate change that led to increased drought, increased environmental disasters, different weather patterns and migrations of animals en masse, all of these things led to the endangerment of thousands of different types of animal species across the globe.
Given that human activity is intrinsically linked with the fact that these animals are endangered, with the fact that the species is suffering at the hands of humankind, we think we have an obligation to act to help them.
Given that we as a species, we as a collective, have benefited from the things that brought so much harm to these animals, we have an obligation to ensure that we don't benefit of of obvious rights violations.
The rights violation of having your homes destroyed, of being put in immense pain and facing death, simply because of the fact that your environment has been eroded.
We don't think that this is just and we think it violates the rights that these animals ought have.
And for these reasons, we should protect endangered species."
"We should raise corporate taxes and the biggest reason why we should raise corporate taxes is because corporations have way too much money.
Corporations have so much money that I honestly truly believe that they're really not going to miss all that much of the money when you tax them higher.
When you look at the profit margins that a ton of corporations are running, they're usually quite large profit margins.
Especially when you're talking about the basic way in which we tax people, tends to be a progressive tax system, the bigger the corporation, the wealthier the corporation is, the more it should be taxed.
That much is obvious.
So when we're talking about the ability to generate revenue, it's probably going to mostly be proportional to the ability of a corporation to actually pay that.
And that's a big deal because right now there's a ton of corporations that are profiting billions and billions of dollars in in earnings.
Billions and billions of dollars that can ultimately be used for a whole lot of greater things.
And that's really important because when you think about the reasons why I think corporations have like a basic moral obligation to pay this money, there's a couple of things there: first and foremost the reason why the corporations are able to make this money in the first place is because of the government.
And they should therefore be funding the government more adequately.
Governments make sure that there is governments first and foremost protect the property in the first place, they use courts, they have a court system to arbitrate disputes, they create various kinds of like other kinds of avenues that make it easier for you to get your products out there, all kinds of things that the government does to actively help corporations.
But beyond that, it's also just kind of a basic comparison of people who have something verses or or I guess an entity that has something verses an entity that doesn't have a whole that much.
There's a whole lot of need in places like america for more money.
More money to spend on infrastructure, healthcare, education, all these kinds of things.
And corporations simply have the money to spend on these kinds of really good public things.
So it's kind of a basic intuitive moral thing.
Help people in need, especially if you have a ton of money and you can afford to do that.
But I also think that this is especially important given what the alternative of what that money is used for.
Because I think that there's this really ridiculous , there's this really ridiculous argument that the other side often makes, republicans often make, is that "" oh, well if you tax corporations too much they're just going to shift jobs.
They're just going to invest less, hire less "".
Things like that.
And I think that a lot of these things are ridiculous.
Because when you talk about most corporations, most corporations park a ton of their assets and don't even do a whole lot with it.
Like you talk about big corporations.
You talk about things like apple that was at one point sitting on more money than the US government was at the height of like like a debt crisis.
You talk about like multi billion dollar corporations that keep revenues essentially as like rainy day funds that they never really need.
You talk about corporations that just kind of like my keep this kind of money around and don't ultimately do that much, or just loan that money to other corporations and don't ultimately generate a whole lot of economic good.
I think that by and large it can be a whole lot better when you look at what the alternative of that money being used for.
Rather than just corporation parking their money, parking their assets in a bank or another investor and leading to like a cyclical economic growth for only people at the very top, now you could actually fuel consumption, because you can rebuild because you can make sure that people have lower healthcare burden costs or people don't have to pay as much for student loans, for education costs.
And those could be all things that are going to increase discretionary funding, which is probably good for corporations anyway.
You can also do things like invest more in a crumbling infrastructure, which is also good for corporations because it makes it more it makes products more easily accessible across different markets.
So I think this is definitely good for the economy as a whole, it's probably good for corporations too.
But none of that, even if none of that is true, it's just an obvious moral thing to do.
So for all those reasons, tax corporations more."
"Boarding schools are advantageous.
So by boarding schools, quite simply we mean schools where children, we're talking about primary and secondary school here, live away from their families, at the school.
So think of something like hogwarts, if you want.
And by advantageous we mean that we think that these are better for their pupils than a traditional school where the pupils live at home during their education.
So three arguments.
The first is that we think students will learn more at boarding schools than other types of schools.
Recognize that there is much more to education than just math, reading and writing.
We think that physical education and social education is as important to producing young citizens as traditional academic education is.
But we do all of these things better.
It's easier to have students spending more time in class and to guarantee that they're doing their homework and their reading if they're at school.
You can have study halls which are monitored by older students or by teachers, and ultimately ensure that students are getting tutoring they need and that they're doing all the work.
You can also have programs like sports that every student can participate in, or educational clubs that every student can participate in, whereas at a normal school some students would have too long to travel going home to be able to take advantage of these opportunities.
Now, everyone would, and we think it's more likely that they would all have well rounded educations if you were able to have this type of education at a boarding school.
If students learn more, then they become more successful citizens, they're able to work and be more effective, and ultimately, we think that it will be to their good in the long run, even if it's difficult for them at times in the short run.
Our second point is point is about reducing inequality.
So some students at a traditional school are going to be able to pay to join sports teams and clubs, are going to have parents who are very well read and who can teach them at home, are going to have tutors and nannies and things like that, and other students are going to go home to an empty house and wait for their parents to come home so they can just have something to eat.
We think that at a boarding school you reduce this type of inequality because all students have access to the kind of human capital that wealthy students would have access to normally.
So they can be around tutors, they can be around religious officials, they can be around people who can help them with problems that they face.
We can also guarantee that students are getting a nutritious, healthy diet, that they have a safe place to sleep, that they're you, know not, being bullied by the other students.
I think that the other side might try to tell you bullying is worse in boarding schools, but we tell you that it's much easier to identify when you have students on the premises, and easier to do something about it.
If you're a working parent you don't have a lot of time to invest in helping a child who's being bullied, and we think that we can take care of it better in a boarding environment.
So ultimately, we think that students from a lower income background are going to benefit especially so that boarding schools are advantageous for that reason.
Our last point is about preparation for life.
So recognize that schools are not an end into themselves who want to produce young citizens, who want to produce workers, etcetera, by using schools.
So how do we do that?
As I mentioned earlier, there's more education than just reading, writing, and math, although those things are certainly important.
But most people don't end up living in the same town that they grew up in.
Most people don't live in their parents house, after they graduate from high school they have to move somewhere else to get a job.
In the real world, so to speak, we don't often get the luxury of spending all of our time with our family or of being sheltered from the realities of the world.
Boarding school is a kind of gentle introduction to what that's like, because in boarding school you know you can have a gentler learning curve than you would otherwise.
Many people go out into the real world from regular schools and they don't know how to live on their own, they don't want to take care of themselves, they've never been away for the family, so they're at a great disadvantage.
But students who have grown up at boarding school are more likely to be independent, more likely to know how to look after themselves, more likely to know how to make friends in a new place, and these are skills that you can't get anywhere else, that are very important for success as an adult.
So for these three reasons, we think boarding schools are advantageous.
Thank you."
"We should end the use of mass surveillance.
In this round, when we're talking about ending mass surveillance, we're not just talking about in the united states.
We think that this this applies broadly to all states, that mass surveillance should not be a thing.
Many of the arguments we make will be based in the united states, but we think that those are transferable across state lines.
So, firstly, we think that a right to privacy should exist and, in the case of the united states, has been codified to exist.
Why do we think that this should exist?
We think that what is fundamental to someone being forced into the state, when someone is a part of the state, we think that it is clear that there should be a separation of private and public life: that people should have the ability to do in their own homes what they see fit, in their private communications, they should be able to speak freely with their peers, with their friends, with their family, without fear that the government is going to get wind of that, and that they should have they shouldn't have this fear that the government is constantly watching them.
It's the plot to every dystopian novel throughout the nineteen hundreds: that the government is going to watch our every move, that the government is going to be able to know everything about what we do and that because of that, the government can intercede in our lives in any number of ways.
And this is coming to pass now because of how digitally connected we are.
Because with our phones, you can track our communications, our location, our purchasing activity, all of this can and is being tracked by the government.
We think that this goes far beyond what is acceptable under a free state.
We think that the free state should allow people to have this separation, this privacy that they can go back into, that when they're acting in their own life, in their own private sphere, that the state shouldn't be able to intercede without any good reason.
And that leads to our second issue, that mass surveillance violates due process.
When mass surveillance is employed, when the government is able to scan our phones, and scan our computers, and and monitor all of our communications, we think that this directly violates due process.
It is codified in the united states constitution.
You can look at, for example, how you need a warrant before you can go and investigate someone's home, before you can break into their home and do a search.
You need to have a just cause for doing so.
You need to have a reasonable belief that a crime is being committed before you can do something like that.
You can't just violate someone's private sphere, but that's exactly what mass surveillance does.
It says we are going to bypass the idea that we need to have a reasonable cause to search someone, and we're going to search their private lives.
We're going to probe their private activities without any sort of just cause and that maybe if we come up with something, we can then use that to criminally prosecute someone, or we can use that to get a warrant to then criminally prosecute someone.
That goes that undermines the entire criminal justice system that we have in the united states and that exists in most just western liberal democracies.
And if that's the case, we think that mass surveillance clearly cannot cannot stay.
But finally, there's the risk of data breaches.
Now, when the government is gathering all of this information about our private lives, there are third-party groups in other states that can hack that data that's being collected, which means that not only is this data being taken in a way that violates due process and our right to privacy, but it's also being stored on servers that are vulnerable to being hacked by other people that could use that information for nefarious purposes.
Whether it's to blackmail or to steal someone's identity, all of these things are problematic and all of them are possible.
Just look at how russian hacking has invaded election systems in the united states.
There's no reason to believe that that same hacking hacking apparatus can't invade the data the data collection that there is due to mass surveillance.
For these reasons, we should end the use of mass surveillance."
"Feminism brings more good than harm.
So just a brief definition.
We're gonna say that feminism is the movement for equality for women.
So obviously this looks different at different places at different times but that's what we're talking about in this debate.
Three arguments first, feminism fights against millennia of oppression.
We see that although today there's a widely accepted norm that men and women should be equal, feminism is still important because all of the baggage from thousands of years women being treated as a lesser than men, as property for men, doesn't just go away because suddenly today people say that there's equality.
Harmful stereotypes, inferior access to medical care, limitations in terms of child rearing responsibilities, all of these things have gone on for millennia and they're still a problem today although we have the notion of equality under the law now.
So we think that the feminist movement because it challenges these ideas and also because it points out underlying assumptions that people don't even realize that they have it challenges people's implicit biases that for this reason, it does more good than harm.
Feminism will always be important even now that women have the right to vote and things like that because it's very important that we challenge the biases that people don't even recognize that they have these implicit biases that ultimately make them treat women as inferior to men.
Our second argument is that feminism limits violence.
So the the history of the relationship between women and men is fundamentally one defined by violence.
If you look at, for instance, the history of the institution of marriage for thousands of years marriage was seen as a transition a property from a father to husband if you look at I study roman law and under roman law a woman is literally the property of her father until she becomes the property of her husband and if the husband dies then she becomes the property of her father again.
She's treated very much like a slave under the law.
So there's a huge amount of violence to the system because no one asks women whether they want to get married off, whether they want to be transferred as property.
They're forced to go and marry someone and then whether or not they're actually consenting into it their husband takes advantage of them in many ways and ultimately this violence has been invisible throughout history until the beginning of the feminist movement, because it was a problem that didn't have a name, that nobody was willing to talk about.
The fact that over half the population was suffering from systemic violence that greatly limited personal freedom and had tremendous dramatic effects on those women.
This is a problem that needs to be addressed and engaged with by every new generation in order to prevent sexual violence, in order to reduce violence against women in society and ultimately the feminist movement because it has the ability to do that has reduced global violence probably more than any other movement in history.
I think it's clear therefore that it does more good than harm.
We're not sure what these harms would even be.
Our third point is about unlocking women's potential because for thousands of years I'm sure that you had women who were geniuses or very gifted at a particular sport or other avenue of excellence that were just ignored because they were just seen as a vehicle for having children and doing housework.
Ultimately you wouldn't have things like female scientists, you wouldn't have female writers, you wouldn't have female athletes, if it weren't for the feminist movement.
Someone like marie curie in the twentieth century never could have come to prominence and done the research that she did without the beginnings of the feminist movement in the nineteenth century and today when you see that there are millions of female scientist obviously this is driving human progress that we're looking at the best people, the smartest most competent people now rather than arbitrarily excluding someone from the work force just because of their sex.
So at the end of the day we think that feminism has increased economic potential of a country, which is obviously good for everyone including men, but also that it allows individual women more freedom to control their destinies because their potential is unblocked through education and training and respect.
So I think it's very clear that at an individual level feminism brings more good than harm.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish marriage.
The model for this is that we wouldn't have any kind of governmental recognition of marriage or any kind of perks associated so currently there are a lot of tax benefits to being married to a second person we would remove those.
You'd still be able to provide tax benefits if you so if a couple has children and you would still allow religious institutions to have ceremonies that look like marriage you just wouldn't have a state institution that sent than says you are officially married.
To my nearest clash the first on why marriage is bad.
First recognize that marriage promotes patriarchal structures.
It was originally created as a religious institution.
So first it's unclear why this should be involved in a like why our government should be involved in this in the first place.
But it's also meant to essentially be a transfer of goods IE the woman to an internal kind of bond internal kind of bond to this man who will now be the person who owns her and essentially like creates this family that she must then take care of and have a house that she must like take care of.
We think that at the point that this is the historical significance of this tradition and it still carries the majority of these norms IE we still have situations in which when people get married they are often stereotyped and expected in the case of the woman to be the one raising the children to be the one that is taking care of the house.
You then have the father giving away their daughter on their wedding day etcetera we don't think that it should be encouraged by the state.
We prefer a world in which you have as much freedom as possible for individual choice to take hold and having institutions that essentially bind the will of another person to another legally and end in and historically minimizes this freedom of choice and we prefer for it to not exist.
We also think that marriage is incredibly hetero normative and monogamy centered.
We barely got legislation across in the united states to allow gay people to get married.
Many countries still haven't done this because it is used so heavily as an institution that is only for those who are straight and monogamous.
The problem with this is that first there are no auditions for those who might be polygamists are polyamorous people.
This is a problem because if someone wishes to be with multiple people and still be able to raise a family there are currently very few avenues for them to do so but second because these kinds of institutions leave people out of important societal norms which is isolating and oftentimes leads to higher rates of depression or suicide in these groups of people in the first place.
There's also a it also creates a societal ideal.
The disk essentially unbeatable by the majority of people.
It causes us to look down on those who don't marry or have kids outside of a marriage or get divorced while saying that the only ones who are living like a actually good life are those who are within a marriage.
Look if marriage is your thing that's fine feel free to do so but we think that people can feel those strong connections that are associated with marriage without putting that title across it and if you're religious you can do so on both sides of the house.
Our second area of clash is why encouraging marriage through benefits is even worse.
Unlike through government association.
Legal restrictions and benefits mold society in that they mold the behavior of the millions of people that participate in it.
Marriage specifically creates incredibly harmful expectations.
It comes with a set of societal stereotypes and is seen as a transitional point in someone's life.
The point in which a woman starts to have children stops working.
At a point in which men are going to get bored make all the money and be unhappy but somehow still dominant.
We can't beat these stereotypes.
We we can in the status quo beat these stereotypes very slowly but the only way we can do so completely and quickly is if we break the institution that harbors them.
General expectation for marriage also occurs at a certain age and so it puts a lot of pressure on individual people to settle down which oftentimes prevents them from actually exploring or finding someone who they love verses someone who they are less afraid of being lonely with.
Marriage also traps people in incredibly problematic ways they should stay together out of love not because of cost or expectation divorce is incredibly expensive and oftentimes if someone left their job to raise children they no longer have a source of income.
And you also get trapped through an expectation.
It's a lot easier to leave a boyfriend or girlfriend but the society doesn't see it the same when you're with a husband and will look down you.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"Hunting should be banned.
In this round we're only going to make one argument but we think it's the most important argument in this discussion, and that is that animal rights should exist, that the lives of animals should be valued, and that hunting massively undermines those rights.
So let's talk about the ban a little bit.
We think that the ban would probably be something like a fine for people that are found to be guilty of hunting right now people are policed through having to have licenses to hunt do other types of things we think the same policing measures can be kept in place but that it would simply be the case that no one could ever hunt, that if you were found hunting you'd be fined.
Alright moving on to the actual meat of this debate.
We think that animals simply deserve to have rights and let's explain why / we think that rights are inherently a social construct and what we mean by this is that rights aren't something that are devined from the natural order of things, rights aren't something that come from some high over overbearing creator that rights as they actualize in law and in our society are constructed by that society that they're built by people based on certain preferences.
We think there are many different ways that people in this in societies across the world choose to construct rights.
Some are deontological meaning that they're given from some sort of rightful nature of the rights, others utilitarian that are that being that they provide the most good the most people but generally we think that all these right systems ultimately boil down to one fundamental concept, that rights are systems that are put in place to maximise pleasure and to minimize pain.
That what we deem to be a right ultimately comes into place because we think that it is essential in order for people to have their pain minimized and have their pleasure maximized.
If you look at rights like the right to life the right to bodily autonomy the right to free expression the right mobility all of these things are incredibly intrinsic to not being given pain and to be able to express yourself in such a way to have pleasure.
We think that in order to have weight in order to have strength rights need to be universalized, otherwise they become arbitrary they become things that we pass on to certain groups when we think that is convenient for that social construct and we don't give to other groups when it's inconvenient for the social construct but this allows rights to be undermined in a variety of ways and allows us to avoid giving rights to people that we think probably deserve them.
We think if your rights are going to be based on pain minimization and pleasure maximization that anything or anyone that can that can have those expressions that can feel pain and feel pleasure should be counted and given some weight.
Animals certainly meet this conclusion, they can feel pain like they can feel pain like that of losing a a close member in one's heard, they can feel pain in being killed through hunting, they can feel pleasure in being together with one's family killing and maiming them clearly violates these rights and when we say that animals deserve rights we don't say that they deserve all the same rights as people but hunting to something that undermines the most fundamental right, the right to life.
This is something that we think is intrinsic to animals ability to feel to feel pleasure and to minimize pain whereas other rights such as the right to vote that we give in a democracy simply isn't something that an animal can experience can actualize through.
Furthermore we think that there's a higher order that is being risked here, that the high order pleasure of life shouldn't be outweighed by the lower order and therefore short term pleasure of hunting.
That in like overall the net pleasure that can be gained from being alive for the animal is going to vastly and dramaticaly we outweigh the overall pleasure that can be gained from hunting and killing that animal.
We think that the ban is good because it protects these rights that the state as the as the legitimate user of a corercive of apparatus should be doing things like protecting rights and upholding those right systems.
Therefore we think that it is necessarily the case that animals given rights for rights constructs to be universalized for rights constructs to be strong and ultimately for people to have their rights protected and for this reason hunting should be banned."
"We should close the guantanamo bay detention camp.
So, we want to be clear about how we think this is going to occur.
There are still dozens of the individuals that are that are interned in guantanamo bay, and we're going to have two main prongs to our model.
The first is that if trials are possible, if there's enough evidence that someone could even feasibly go to trial, we would put these people on trial, we would do this in a civilian rather than a military court, because we think there are there's more openness, there's more opportunity for people to get a fair defense in the civilian court, and therefore we think that this is only just, especially given that these individuals are for the most part not military members.
And secondly, if there isn't enough evidence to even bring these individuals to trial, we would say that they would just be returned to their homes, will be given will be put back into their home country and they would be allowed to go free.
Ok.
Two main arguments.
The first is on morality, and the second is on legalism and international relations.
So on morality.
We think that most prisoners in guantanamo bay are currently held without substantial evidence to charge them, or any sort of real reason that they are in there.
They didn't deserve the internment that they're currently experiencing, and on top of the fact that they are being detained, which in and of itself is unjust, the conditions of their detainment is simply inhumane and what this means is that people are denied basic human rights, and are given are subject to things such as torture that go against major international law, and go against our fundamental moral code.
We think that, from a deontological framework, human beings are not deserving of this kind of inhumane treatment, and this can be seen as codified in liberal democracies across the world.
And even if you want to take on a utilitarian framework of morality, torture is shown time and again to be an ineffective means of getting information from people, of getting information that could stop terrorist attacks or things of this nature, and given that there's no real gain to torturing and detaining these individuals in this prison, we don't think that there's any sort of moral justification to leave them interned.
But the second thing we want talk about is the international relations surrounding guantanamo bay, and why it's so problematic for the united states.
So firstly, the united states, over its history, has constructed a large amount of the current international law such that exists in the world, such as the geneva conventions and certain human rights conventions that have been signed onto by the united states.
We would say that in a world in which guantanamo bay exists, the united states loses the moral high ground that allows it to enforce those international laws.
It means that when american citizens and american civilians are detained by states that these people are subject to torture and are subject to poor treatment by these states, and this means that in having guantanamo bay, without any sort of positive gains from it, it puts americans at risk of the inhumane treatment that we cause to others.
It also angers many people in the international world from individuals from individual countries in europe, which if you are a human rights treatment is abhorrent, to middle eastern and north african countries whose citizens are subject to detainment in guantanamo bay.
This means that in that individual countries are less likely to want to work with the united states in the international sphere, and it means the united states loses much of its standing abroad.
Finally, we think that guantanamo bay, for the most part, serves as propaganda for terror cells in the status quo.
Terrorists can point to guantanamo bay to show that this the united states doesn't care about human rights, it doesn't care about civilians that aren't their own civilians, and they can paint the united states as this great evil, and show the factual evidence of guantanamo bay as a site where torture routinely takes place and human rights are routinely ignored.
Given that it causes immense international harms, and that morally guantanamo bay is repugnant and unjustifiable, we should close the guantanamo bay detention camp."
"We should further exploit green technology.
So by green technology we basically mean technology that is designed to make it easier for humans to interact with the earth in a positive way and to preserve the earth for birth for future generations.
We think that alternative energy like solar panels might be a good example of this, and on top of that, things like mitigation technology.
Say, technology to scrub harmful particles out of the emissions from cars or power plants, for instance.
So with this in mind, we have three main arguments.
The first is about energy and stability.
We think that because people rely so much on electricity in their day to day lives, the ability to provide energy to them in a clean, effective, and most importantly, reliable fashion is essential to national stability.
In the future, it looks as though we will reach a point when oil will become too expensive to rely upon as we do right now for power generation in many parts of the world, and the same is likely true for coal, although farther away from the present.
We can avert this crisis now if we invest, while we still have cheap fossil fuel energy, in alternatives.
We can better allow nations to become self sufficient, and ultimately we think that the ability to guarantee that citizens have access to reliable energy so that they can work and live as they're accustomed to do so is essential for national stability in the future, and that because of this we will be much better off by further exploiting green technology.
The comparative in this round, of course, isn't just green technology versus no green technology.
I'm sure some will exist on either side of the debate.
But the comparative is attempting to replace these fossil fuels and exploit green energy more than we exploit fossil fuels and similar sources of energy because those aren't sustainable and these are, so relying on fossil fuels will always put stability at risk in the future.
Our second argument is about the duty of current people to future generations.
So recognize that of course, there are harms to burning fossil fuels and other things that we would use to or will be replaced by green technology.
For instance, we see that the earth is growing warmer, or the climate is changing as a result of CO two emissions.
Now, it's probably true that future people are going to have the same types of property rights that current people do, which means that they ought be able to enjoy the property that they own and the common property such as the earth and the seas that they inherit.
But because of a something called feedback loops, they won't be able to do so if we don't take action now.
Even if in the future very advanced technology allows us to remove CO two from the atmosphere, or otherwise improve the quality of the earth and undo past damage, it seems likely that any irreparable damage that is done is going to be get worse and worse and worse the longer we put off trying to solve the problem.
We think that, for instance, the earth getting warmer it gets warmer a little bit every year as more CO two builds up in the atmosphere.
But the problem is not linear, it relies on the total amount of CO two in the atmosphere and as that gets greater and greater and greater every year, building off of past years, ultimately the problem gets much more severe and might not be able to be reversed.
So we think that by investing further in green technology and adopting it wholesale whenever possible, we guarantee the freedom of future generations to enjoy their property and the earth and things around them, and on top of that prevent creating a situation that they will be unable to improve the earth using their technology.
Our last argument is about human potential.
We think that fundamentally, what limits human potential in the future is our energy sources.
People absolutely have the intellectual capacity to continue to advance and grow, but we see that in the past transitions such as the switch from wood to coal have facilitated massive leaps in technology that allowed human beings to engage with nature and the world in a very different way.
If humans are ever going to explore other planets, or the deepest seas, or live on the earth in a completely sustainable way, we think that they will rely on new energy sources to be able to do so.
At this point we better achieve a bright future for humanity by investing further in green technology.
So for these reasons we think that we better reach human potential at its highest.
So for all of these reasons, we should further exploit green technology.
Thank you."
"I'm proud to support the motion that we should further exploit sustainable energy.
Three independent points, the first of which is that this mitigates the effects of global warming.
So a significant amount of global warming stems from our usage of fossil fuels.
Things like say carbon dioxide go up into the atmosphere, greenhouse effect, planet warms up.
You know, etcetera etcetera.
At the point then where fossil fuels and things like you know crude oil, coal, what not are tied to the the warming of the environment and the environmental effects that are associated with that, say rising sea levels, weather patterns, that sort of thing, we think that it is necessary to mitigate those effects on the basis that it provides a significant harm to people in the world if not an absolute existential threat.
Sustainable energy is of course linked to this on the basis that the things that are creating such significant pollution are by nature finite resources.
So when we're talking about sustainable energy, we're talking about things that aren't finite in nature, like you know your coal your oil, so on, we're talking about things that are more or less infinite, like say sun light or say you know water flow.
At that point then we think that the mitigation of global warming is probably the most significant impact in this debate, because of the extreme nature of the harms it creates, and as such we should be looking to mitigate those effects in any way possible.
Our second independent point though is that even if you think that like global warming is a myth or whatever, that pollution itself is just a generally good thing to avoid.
So look to like beijing, for example, with the significant amount of smog that creates horrible like quality of life effects.
I think even if you're stepping away from the broader environmental effects, they're very obvious measurable ways in which consumption of fossil fuels has generated significant harms upon the people of the planet.
So, if you want to mitigate these types of things that lead to like lung disease and like various types of ailments, it's necessary to cut down on the usage of coal, oil, other fossil fuels, and instead transition to things like solar and like you know hydroelectricity, in order to ensure that you are you know creating less of those externalities.
Our third and final point though is the economics behind this switch.
And I think this is probably what's most important here.
The f a fundamental basis for continuing to use fossil fuels is that they're cheap.
Coal especially is extremely extremely cheap to use relative to the output.
So what you're probably going to hear from op is like: "" oh, but like transitioning the world to solar power, whatever, would be vastly more expensive and people would have to pay more for electricity. ""
While this is probably true in the short term.
I think there's sort of two reasons why in the long term this isn't true.
The first is that when you you know have enough of the the international grid so to speak put on these types of sustainable energy, the amount of money that goes into researching and investing in you know perfecting these forms of energy goes up significantly.
So we think that right now a lot of like global giants like exxon mobil for example are, while they're somewhat investing in things like solar technology, they're mostly focused on the status quo of fossil fuels.
We think though if you sort of pushed for that balance to shift toward sustainable energy, the research money would go towards making things like solar or hydroelectricity significantly cheaper.
But the second and more important reason is that the finite nature of fossil fuels means eventually you're going to run out.
And at that point then, two things happen: one, in the interim the scarce resources drive up the cost of fossil fuels extraordinarily high to the point where they don't become financially usable anymore.
But secondly when they do run out you're left with technology that's not affordable, because the research hasn't been put in yet to drive down the costs.
As a result, we prefer a world where we simply ease ourselves into sustainable energy by doing the leg work now to make sure that what we have to put our grid entirely on sustainable electricity, it's out a point where it's developed enough to be cheap and like a feasible source of energy for the entire planet.
Proud to propose."
"Boarding schools should be abolished.
So, by boarding schools, we mean primary and secondary schools where students go away from home to live in, you know, another city or another region of their country for their education.
So, an example of this might be andover in the US, eton in england or many other similar schools around the world.
Boarding schools tend to be private in some countries but also receive public funding in others, and they're often some of the best schools in their country.
So, two main arguments for why they should be abolished: first, because they're bad for students and second, because of broader harms to society.
So why are boarding schools bad for students?
First: we see that there has been a rampant culture of abuse in boarding schools, in the US and britain at any rate, and I'm sure in other countries as well.
Because students spend all of their time in dorms or around faculty, there is tremendous potential for bullying and physical abuse by other students.
There was a very prominent legal case recently in the US where one of the nation's most prestigious boarding schools was found to have sexual abuse by the older students against the younger students.
It's very difficult for the faculty to monitor the children the way that a parent would be able to because there are, you know, ten children for every teacher and most of the teachers don't live in the dorms, as opposed to having three to four children per every family.
So we think that the door is open for abuse from other students, but also from instructors as well.
Because the students spend so much time around the instructors outside of class, we think that it's much easier for there to be inappropriate relations or abuse and also that parents won't be around to look for the warning signs.
So we think that children are put at risk when you place them into these schools.
Our second argument for why their bad for children is that they lead to poor socialization.
When you go to public school, every day you probably interact with lots of people of different ages.
I remember when I was in school, you know, I would walk there from where I worked and I would see elderly people and talk to them, you know, young children going to other schools.
I interacted a lot with people of different ages, and I think this is important for children's development, that they learned how to be respectful to the elderly, how to talk to children younger than them, not just how to interact with their peers.
But a boarding school, by its very nature, insulates you and surrounds you with other people of your own age, which stunts your development as a person because you don't interact as much with people from different walks of life much less people of different ages.
In particular, we think it's likely that you won't interact with people of lower socioeconomic status, who probably can't go to these schools.
This means that you're probably less likely to be sympathetic to them and to people who are different from you, in general, because contact is so important to building sympathy.
Lastly, we would say that children benefit from spending lots of time with their families, that they need their parents as role models, that they need to bond with their siblings to form a long-lasting relationships, and that ultimately this is undermined by boarding schools.
Our second argument is about why boarding schools are harmful for society.
First of all, we tell you that boarding schools often lead to societal inequality.
They concentrate, most likely, the children of the elite or a handful of lucky children from other classes into one area and then spend huge amounts of resources on those children.
This comes at the expense of children who go to day schools, because they don't have access to those resources.
But moreover, it creates a sort of feedback where it's very likely that the alumni of these schools go on to have children who then go back to those schools, because these alumni are able to make donations or because their children have access to certain educational and economic privileges.
This creates a certain class of people who receive a much better education than everyone else, which ultimately means that they have greater advantages than other people in society who can't compete, and also that they're not likely to understand that this gap exists because of all the isolation I just told you about.
So with this in mind, we should ban boarding schools because they undermine children and because they're harmful for society.
Thank you."
"We should abolish standardized testing.
By this we mean that all schools, universities, public schools, private schools, pretty much every form of educational institute should stop relying on standardized tests as a metric for what students have learned.
We think that a really good example of a standardized test would be the SAT, which is the american university entrance exam, and is sat by millions of students every year.
In theory the SAT is of equal difficulty at every sitting and the questions are cycled in and out, so you could get one question from a large set of questions on any given test.
Many american states also have end of year exams which are standardized, and the practice is becoming more and more common over the years despite some push back from educators.
So we have two big arguments.
The first is why we think standardized tests are an unfair metric for what students have actually learned.
So if the purpose of a test is to be an assessment of students learning or ability, we think standardized tests failed to do so because they're unfair.
These tests are often highly racialized.
They rely on assumptions that students come from a certain background and that they know certain cultural information that they may not have.
In a highly multi ethnic society like the US, canada, australia, for instance, we think that many students who are from say a native background or recent immigrants are likely to be put at a disadvantage compared to white students or students whose families have been in these countries for hundreds of years.
At that point we think that it's less of a test of whether or not you actually learned you know high school history and more a test of are you part of the in group that is privileged enough to get to make this test.
We also think that this test closely reflect the social class of the test taker.
In particular these tests are relatively easy to study for and prep for but oftentimes it takes a lot of free time and resources.
The SAT is a good example of this.
It's said that it's more important that your parents are wealthy.
Your parents' wealth corresponds better with your SAT score then your high school grades do.
It cost a lot of money to hire a tutor for standardized testing, and if you have a job, or if you don't have a lot of free time because you're taking care of your siblings, for instance, then you can't actually access this.
So these tests systematically reward the students who are already the most economically privileged even if they didn't learn the most in school.
We also tell you that every sitting is probably different.
If you take a standardized test in february and take it again in august, you might get a much better score the second time without learning anything else just because the questions that you get happen to be things that you already knew.
It's almost chance to what you're actually being tested on.
Where is a test that was made by a teacher, we think, would probably reflect what you actually learned and be made with certain knowledge in mind so that you couldn't just get lucky to the same extent.
In the same way we think that a test made by a teacher might account for your racial background or your social class better than this one test that's meant to fit everyone.
We think that a one size fits all approach, which is basically what the standardized test is, will ultimately be very unfair to most people.
Our second argument is that standardized test interfere with learning.
We think that they contribute to the gamification.
The making of education game like.
We think that this is true because you can study for a test and learn the types of questions that will be on it.
When someone studies for the LSAP, for instance, they learn the types of questions and focus on that rather than studying content, and we don't think that learning the types of questions on the LSAP will make you a better lawyer.
Learning content might.
Teachers often feel compelled to teach to the test because they'll get job assessments that are based on student scores rather than what they learn.
So no one cares if little johnny actually learned algebra only if he does well on the new york state end of year exams.
So ultimately the teachers teach to those exams rather than trying to actually get across the concepts, like say, algebra.
We think that this marginalizes subjects that aren't being tested because if there is a standardized math exam and reading exam but there's no standardized history exam, you have to spend a lot more time on those two subjects in order to get a good job review, so you neglect other subjects even if those are also important for students development.
And we think that ultimately this undermines the purpose of school which is to make people well rounded citizens who are able to engage with the world around them, by instead causing them to focus in on tests that cease to be relevant after you've sat them.
So for these reasons we support the abolition of standardized tests.
Thank you."
"We should privatize the united states social security.
We think that the way that we would go about doing this is to transfer social security account management to the private investment firm of the holder's choosing.
So whoever has the social security account the individual that that account is accumulating money for that person would be able to choose which private investment firm is going to handle their social security handle the investment of that social security.
You'd still have to pay into social security as you had been in the past that system isn't going to change it's just how we're going to manage that is going to strip to private investment firms.
First we think you get a better return on investment what you privatize social security.
And secondly we think you get more personalized decisions which is more just given that it's your money that's going into social security we think you should have some sort of modicum of choice as to how that money is being spent.
So first on a better ROI.
Standard social security does not earn an immense amount of interest.
This essentially forces people to put money into a low interest savings account rather than invest in other opportunities.
There are much more lucrative retirement funds that exist than social security but social security in the status quo cannot be bolstered.
And the money that's going in there can be bolstered in the same ways as these other funds.
Privatizing we would say fixes this quite easily.
These institutions these private investment firms are built to provide larger returns for their clients and they have two main incentives to do this.
The first is a market incentive.
There's competition to hold assets as an as an investment firm you want to have as many assets as possible in order to bolster your investments in order to invest in more lucrative deals in order to increase your clout in the marketplace.
All these things means that firms are likely to hire top talent with a proven track record of increasing their shareholders in revenue and increasing the revenue for those that invest with them.
The second major incentive is that investors get commission based off of their earnings er not investors but the people that are investing the private investment firms they get in they get a commission based off of the earnings so there's a direct financial incentive to earn as much money as possible because when your clients earn money you as an investor also are earning money you get more and more money this weeping this multi faceted incentive program means that you're almost guaranteed to have a better return on investment than social security does in the status quo.
So on more personalized decisions.
Because there are a number of firms you can invest with there are a number of different types of private investment firms you can have a more personalized choice over how your money grows and is invested.
You can choose to invest in an ethical practice there are a number of firms that have risen up especially over the past couple of decades that invest primarily in ethical practices.
These are firms that differentiate themselves from say the firms that are likely to invest in oil companies that invest in bad farming practices that invest in things that degrade the environment you can make that choice and therefore you know that your money is being used in a way that you believe to be ethical.
You can also invest in safer low risk investments.
If you like that social security and the status quo is stable you can invest in a private investment firm that's going to invest in low risk options like bonds.
You can also invest in particular industries.
You can choose to go with an investment firm that has a track record in tech or that has a track record in real real estate or any type of market that you choose.
We think that this is good because it gives each account holder the ability to choose how the money that they affirm through their labor to their time how that money is going to be spent what causes and what businesses that money is going to and it gives them more choice over the amount of risk they want to take on for their long term financial planning.
We think that all of this is better than the status quo and on balance you're going to get better return on investment for these reasons we should privatize the united states social security."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should ban algorithmic trading.
Three independent points: first that algorithms can be uncontrollable and are much more subject to error than human trading.
The way that algorithms are often constructed in the financial industry is to automatically make trades based on certain inputs.
So, a certain thing happens in the market and the computer sees that is a, you know, positive or negative signal for an individual investment, and then they will buy or sell that, you know, stock or whatever, based on that market cycle.
The problem is that these algorithms are designed by humans.
They are, you know, from a design perspective, as subject to error as a human is.
But because they run automatically, they are less adaptable to changes in the market that are not commonplace.
That is, you know, if you were playing around with some market variable like, say, you know, sales of cheese for a dairy company, you might generally say: if more people are buying cheese, you should invest in the dairy company.
But some, you know, small unpredictable left-field thing that probably isn't going to happen and the average person might not think of can be, you know, be overlooked in the designing of the algorithm.
And as a result, if that thing happens, that algorithm can make some pretty disastrously bad choices.
Now, notably, this would just be a problem for the investment firm, you know, if you think about this straightforwardly, but the problem is that that's not always true.
Depending on the investment firms, really important things can be connected to that firm's success, you know, people's retirement funds, people's, you know, mortgages, things like that.
This is really important, then, because you can have pretty profound impacts on the economy by faults in your algorithms.
And if this happens repeatedly across multiple firms, as it has on occasion, this can create some really serious issues for the economy.
Our second independent point is that algorithms enable rapid trading that this can lead to flash crashes.
So algorithms, you know, quite obviously, work a lot quicker than humans.
They're automatic and as a result, they can make trades very, very quickly.
The problem is that humans have to, you know, take a look at these and make sure everything's on the right track, and obviously humans have a little bit of a delay when compared to the speed of a computer.
This, in turn, leads to flash crashes, which are rare but are profound.
You know, sometimes over the course of like a twenty minute span, a massive chain reaction in the ways that these algorithms interact with each other can just have horrible, horrible impacts on the stock market.
People lose millions of dollars.
This is a problem.
It doesn't happen with humans as frequently because humans work slower.
You can, you know, react more rationally and more level-headedly when you have the capacity to just sort of slow things down and see what's going on in the market at the time.
But because the algorithms keep moving and the humans have to figure out a quick way to intervene, the response is often imperfect, and as a result the crash can have a much more profound impact on the market.
Our third independent point is that high frequency trading can actually kill small firms, and that leads to consolidation in the industry.
What we mean by this is that algorithmic trading is very, very dependent on hardware, not skills.
So, whereas small firms frequently used to be able to compete well by just having a small group of people that were very qualified at what they did and were smart, they could usually get by on that.
The problem though is that this becomes less and less of a possibility when high frequency trading makes your firm's success contingent upon the quality of your hardware.
Someone with just better wiring for their computers, that can act faster and make deals at a quicker rate, snatches up all the capital on the market, leaving smaller firms to struggle.
This leads to consolidation in the industry, which is a problem, a, because larger firms have more leverage over their clients and can therefore be engage much more abusive and predatory practices, but b, because killing the small firms decreases competition in the market and leads to more or less monopolies, if not cartels, at least, that are also harmful for the ways in which that industry interacts with consumers.
Proud to propose."
"Bombing of hiroshima nagasaki were justified.
So, we think that, what's important in this debate is to look at it in a comparative context, because obviously, it's sad and tragic that, thousands of innocent people died in order to prevent the continuation of a war, but, it's also important to recognize that, japan even though it was losing, was not at a point where it was likely to surrender.
Military leadership have been warned about the possibility of such bombings, and still chose not to surrender.
The hierarchy of japanese society didn't allow such surrender to happen.
So, we think that, what is very likely is that these bombings hadn't had happened, the war would have gone on longer, more tragic things would have occurred, and while like, the counter factual is very difficult to conceptualize, we think that there are a few reasons under it why it's preferable that the bombings happened, and why, in that sense, they're justified.
So, let's look at some of the tactics that were done in the war.
Things like firebombing of japanese land that also killed innocent civilians, though didn't do it in the same kind of massive scale, we think that these things would've continue to happen, in a land invasion.
We also think that, a land invasion of japan, rather than the bombings, would have led to the deaths of thousands of united of US soldiers, and as the united states, as the allied powers, we think that you have a foremost obligation to protect those soldiers, those people that, whether drafted of volunteered, are being forced to put their lives on the line, put their lives at risk in order to protect us from an obvious threat.
So, why do we what are the reasons that we think make this a justice case?
Firstly, the US needed the US needs to care for its own.
The united states has an obligation, as a society, as a state, to protect the civilians that compose that state.
While it's true that, there may be obligations to people outside of that state, your foremost obligation is to those within your state.
That's, the tautology of your existence is to protect those of your own state.
And given that this is the case, we think that it's preferable to do the thing that, on the calculus of war, insures that fewer of your soldiers die, even if it may mean to some civilians dying in japan.
Secondly, we think that the calculus is one that means that, either way even with civilian deaths, this was a justified calculation, because the fire bombings would've continued, because the war of world war two was not some pretty thing, in which individual civilian rights were respected, but rather we think that a land invasion would've resulted in many US soldiers committing horrible crimes against the individuals of of japan, especially because there's an intense anger towards japan, because it had attacked the united states first.
This is one of the few instances, in which US aggression is wholly justified, in the nature of self defense.
So, given that in the long run, it's likely that, more japanese civilians would have died due to either, US soldiers actions, or the strategic planning of firebombing cities, in order to make it impossible for for japan to fight back, we think that this strategy is the one that led to the fewest on net deaths, and it also ensured that, the war was able to come to an end quickly, it ensured that the the japan wasn't completely taken out, which means it was capable of being rebuilt, and as we've seen, japan has been able to become a a massive power on the world stage.
Finally, we want to recognize that, the united states gave warnings about what was going to happen.
This wasn't a blind attack on japanese soil, but rather they dropped pamphlets unto the unto to the cities, in which civilians may have been targeted, they gave opportunity for people to leave.
Yes, we recognize that this was a hard task to do, but on the net, on on the whole, we think that it's just clear that, these bombings allowed for fewer civilians to die, and allowed for the war, a war that was justified because of japanese aggression, to come to an end quicker.
And for those reasons, we believe the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were justified."
"Open source software is advantageous.
Open source software is software in which the contents and development data for this software are made public, and the ability to play with that data, to be able to change it, to hack it, to modify it to how you see fit, is open to publishers everywhere.
If you have the ability to make edits, if you have the ability to program, you can work with this software.
This is opposed to software such as the microsoft software that controls windows, in which this isn't open source, and adding into this is a violation of intellectual property and you can't redistribute it.
So, we think that there are four clear benefits of open open source software.
The first is this drives down tech costs.
The ability to have open source software means that you can have a variety of competing platforms that can be more easily personalized, and can be more easily fit to how individuals want to use that software.
What this means is that you can have a variety of different individuals in the market marketing this type of software, with slight variations that are increasingly important to how individuals are using their personal technology.
This means that you can have a variety of variety of more competitors within the tech market, within the software market, and what this does is it drives down tech prices for people overall.
Secondly, we think that it increases cooperative development.
What this means is that we think that when you have an open source software, in which you don't have to be within the same company to work on the development of a software, but you can be across the world working together on forums and working together through different sort of cooperative methods, we think you can get a better gathering of intellects, a better gathering of specializations, and overall you can get more innovation in how we create our technology, because when you have more minds that can work together with a variety of different backgrounds.
And furthermore you can allow people to build off of other advancements.
It means that not only do you have people working to solve and advance software collectively, but it also means that you have more platforms to build off of that software, which means that you can have not just an innovation that is done collectively, but an innovation in which when one person creates something, five other people can take that platform that has been developed or that that piece of software and create something new from it.
It means that you don't just have collective innovation, but you have individual innovation growing out of the same sphere.
The third the third the third benefit of open source software is how it can be personalized.
We've seen through people doing things like jailbreaking iphones, that people increasingly care about the ability to personalize their technology, to choose how their technology is going to function, to edit and make changes to how their software is going to operate.
Open source software means that you don't need to violate intellectual property laws to do this, and it means that you, even as a layperson who doesn't know how to program, can get the type of personalization that you want through easier easy developer tools or through the the developers the developer work that other people have done in order to make changes to that software.
Regardless of how it's done, open source software on balance allows for more personalization and more diversity in experience, which we think is just good for the consumer compared to other types of software, along with driving down prices for the consumer, as we've already discussed.
Finally, we think open source software allows for more privacy.
When you have open source software, it means that you have more variation in types of security systems, and more variation in how hackers may be able to exploit that software.
What that means is that when you have different niches and different people using the software in different ways, it makes it a less likely software to be targeted by hackers, because it doesn't have the same central mass as, say, hacking, one forum that works similarly, say, all gmail accounts or all yahoo accounts.
When you have open source software in which people have made independent variations on the software, what you get is a system that is overall more private, because it's just less prone to being attacked by things like spamming or other types of hacking methods that are used for massive data collection.
So with these four tangible benefits, and given that open source software doesn't doesn't mean there's any sort of trade-off in other developmental systems, we certainly think that open source software is advantageous."
"National service in the united states should be mandatory.
So, as a little bit of background: since the end of the vietnam war in the nineteen seventies, the united states has had a system called selective service which basically means that every young man, before he turns eighteen, has to put their name into a sort of draft registry which could be used if the US ever wanted to call everyone up to serve in the future.
What we would advocate for is that every young man and woman in the united states, when they come of age, should have to do one to two years of military service.
So this would be an extension of the existing selective service process but it would require everyone who was able to do so to serve in the armed forces in some way.
We would be okay with accommodating people who are, you know, conscientious objectors or religious by allowing them to serve in civilian style roles, things like administration, but ultimately we want to have everyone under the umbrella of public service.
Two arguments: the first is that we think that this would be beneficial for young people.
Youth unemployment in the united states is extremely high right now relative to unemployment for the general populace.
We think that youth unemployment will be reduced by our policy for a couple of reasons: first of all, many young people will be taken out of the job market for a couple of years by their service, which means that the jobs that they would have had would now be open for young people who are coming out of the service.
So we think that they will be less competition in the job market.
But on top of that we tell you that ultimately young people would gain skills and training which they would be able to use after they got out of the military.
For instance, if you were assigned to maintain fighter jets or something, then you would come out of the military and half the training that you would need to work for an aeronautical engineering company or something like that.
We also think that because veterans in the united states receive certain benefits that civilians don't, that it would be better if everyone were a veteran.
We think that people would be able for instance to claim huge reductions to the cost of college tuition, so ultimately you would end up with a workforce where more people will be able to access education regardless of their personal wealth.
This will be a great equalizer between the rich and the poor.
Along those lines, we also think that people would have to meet those who are very different from themselves.
If you're drafted into the army and sent to a base in another part of the country, we think it's likely that you would meet people of different races and religions that might not live in your hometown or your home state.
So this would promote greater understanding of the american experience writ large and encourage people to be more tolerant and accepting of others.
Our second argument is that this would be a good thing because it would lead to fewer conflicts.
Recognize that right now, because the US has a professional all volunteer army, that there's a certain attitude among civilians that if we get into a war everyone who has to go fight wanted to be there.
So you see, for instance, that when we invaded iraq a few years ago, people were broadly okay with it because they said ""look, even if soldiers don't want to go fight now, they still signed up.
Nobody made them do this and they're getting paid and are getting lots of benefits for it. ""
But if everyone's son and daughter had to go join then we think that there would have been mass outrage about the war in iraq.
We don't think that the american people would be willing to accept the adventurism that has become commonplace in our culture, as a result of the all volunteer army.
If everyone knew that their children were going to be at risk if we got into a conflict, then we think that they would vote for more peaceful politicians and that congress would be less likely to authorize military action because they would be worried about losing reelection if they sent young people off to war, and also because their own sons and daughters would be affected by these decisions.
We think that this will be good not only for the US to avoid conflict but also probably for the rest of the globe.
Right now, the US is the country most likely to unilaterally invade other countries for whatever ideological reason.
We think that people in iraq and afghanistan, for instance, would probably prefer a world in which the united states was less willing to invade them and this is probably also going to be true for whoever our next victim is.
So at the end of the day we tell you that this policy would help young people and lead to less conflict.
Therefore we think national service in the US should be mandatory.
Thank you."
"We should further exploit hydroelectric dams.
So, hydroelectric dams are just ordinary dams that produce electricity and by further exploit, we think that countries around the world should seek to build hydroelectric dams preferentially, relative to traditional sources of energy and at a greater rate than they're doing in the status quo.
So, three big arguments for you.
The first is about why we need to transition to renewable energy.
So, the first question there would be: is hydroelectric power renewable?
But we see that rivers will continue to run whether or not we dam them, so it seems very likely that this is a sustainable form of energy in the long term, and it's one that doesn't involve any sort of pollution.
It is true that hydroelectric dams may disrupt the flow of water.
It may be damaging, say, to migratory fish, but we see that there are ways to work around this.
We might disable a hydroelectric power plant during a migration by animals, or we might come up with a way for fish to bypass it.
There're there are these little steps that salmon can jump up they use at some hydroelectric dams up in alaska, for instance.
Scientists are clever.
I'm sure that they'll be able to come up with a workaround here.
We think that it's essential, though, that we transition to green energy to reduce our carbon emissions.
The population is only growing and, particularly, as regions like china and india develop and these people have a higher quality of life, they're going to demand more access to energy.
We need to ensure that that energy is provided in the cleanest way possible, which means building things like hydroelectric dams.
The other great advantage of hydroelectric dams is that you can build them on almost any river in the world.
Wind power only works where you have strong wind currents, so that might be good in massachusetts, but not so good in florida.
And solar power, of course, relies on getting lots of sun which means that as you move further north, it's less and less useful.
Hydroelectric power can be used almost anywhere in the world, so we think that it is the type of green energy that we ought most invest our efforts into.
Our second argument is about energy independence.
Many countries around the world rely on their neighbors for electricity production.
To use a benign example, germany recently closed down lots of nuclear power plants after the fukushima disaster in japan, and now they buy electricity from france, where it's produced by nuclear power plants.
I thought it was a bit funny, but what's important here is that countries can improve on their energy independence through further exploitation of hydroelectric dams.
A country like egypt, for instance, that's built massive dam projects in the past, has reduced their dependence on the international community for energy.
We think that by building hydroelectric dams, you therefore strengthen your own economy because you avoid imports, and you also create skilled jobs in the form of the engineers who would work at these plants and, in addition, you create work in terms of constructing these hydroelectric dams, etcetera.
We think that it would be a stimulus for the economy.
And our last argument is that we think that it is a wasted opportunity when rivers flow undammed.
Recognize that the energy that a river contains when it flows to the sea is being spent one way or the other.
If you build a hydroelectric dam, then that energy can go to powering hospitals and schools and houses.
And if you don't, then that energy goes to pushing some sand around at the bottom of an estuary.
We think that it's important that we don't waste energy.
It's a finite resource, however much of it that there may be in nature.
Given that our potential to spend energy in the future is going to grow exponentially it seems, it has certainly grown exponentially since the beginning of the nineteenth century, we think that we need to take every effort now to harness as much of the earth's energy as possible so that future people may have a higher quality of life and a better standard of living and that, ultimately, it would be a wasted opportunity not to further exploit these hydroelectric dams.
So because it's a good form of green energy, because it promotes energy independence, and because not to do so would be a wasted opportunity, we should further exploit hydroelectric dams.
Thank you."
"Casinos should be banned.
So we think that this motion is fairly straightforward.
We would say that within the state all casinos should be banned.
Gambling itself we would say is a different topic but casinos are widespread gambling in one place in the way the casinos are set up, we would ban all of them.
Alright we only have one main argument to make in this round but we think that is the most important argument in this debate and this is that in a factual sense, the gambling that takes place in casinos is rigged and that en masse it will always harm the people on net compared to the good that it does for some people that win.
So why do we think that this is the most important argument before we explain it.
We think that one of the primary focuses of the government is to make hard decisions for people when the government is more aware of the information and is more capable of making rational choices than the people are.
We think that as a species humanity is incredibly bad at long term planning and in internalizing in in internalizing very complex ideas.
One of those complex ideas are the odds of actually winning big at a casino.
The actual odds and statistical likelihood of someone being successful weighed against the statistical likelihood of someone losing dramatically more money than they're likely to win.
Given that people are bad at internalizing these values and that we know that casinos are set up in any number of ways to ensure that the house always wins, that they are a profitable system for casino owners and a not profitable system for casino patrons, we think that because the government is aware of these facts the government should step in and ban casinos and unlike other instances where you can ban something or you could regulate it to some immense degree, there's no regulation that can take place with a casino that's going to prevent it from having all of the harms of being rigged to favor the house.
If you were to do that these casinos would just close on their own anyway because they wouldn't be profitable anymore and at that point you're basically banning them even if you're not outright banning them.
So what do casinos actually do to ensure that they are always going to win?
Casinos create a number of structures in the construction of those buildings in the way they construct the games to ensure they win.
Despite on top of the odds in the way that the games themselves are built, they're also built to try and keep people in these casinos for as long as possible.
You create buildings that don't allow you to see that it's dark outside or that the sun has come up or to know what's going on in the outside world so you're totally fixated on those casinos.
They glamorize casinos so that people don't understand how likely they are to win.
They show the winners and they lie and they deceive to the people through marketing about what these casinos could actually do for them and you make it easy for people to gamble far beyond your means.
There's very little check in these casinos to see that someone has some sort of a problem and that they're losing not only their own money but the money that is necessary for people that that rely on them for family and friends and people that are close to them they lose their money as well.
People are horrible long term planners and the state must step in in this instance to ensure that people don't harm those around them through gambling away what is most important to them, for gambling away their savings, the money that they've earned throughout their life.
We think that at the end of the day, in a world in which casinos are banned the vast majority of people who would visit casinos regularly are going to be net better for their lives.
They're going to have net more money.
They're going to have lost fewer things.
They're going to have burned fewer relationships than if those casinos had not been banned and we think when the government is making a decision about paternalism that is the key factor and because of this casinos should be banned."
"Television does more harm than good.
We think the comparative in this debate, sense it's hard to imagine a counterfactual without television, is a world in which television plays a much less prominent role, in which people don't spend many hours a day focusing on the television, watching entertainment on TV, if the main media platform for sending entertainment out to the masses was not television, we think that's the world that we're largely talking about.
We don't imagine that television would be eliminated altogether, but this is a debate about weighing the balances of the positive aspects of television, against the negative, and in that eh with that in mind, we have two main arguments about why television does on net more harm than good.
The first is about bad cultural impact.
So, recognize that, the television that we're talking about today is very different from the nascent television, in which you had four channels vying for your attention, and people just weren't normalized to the idea of sitting in front of their TV.
We think that, in the status quo, what you've what you have through television is a few problematic things: first is the rise of twenty four hour media.
We think that the rise of media, as a competitive market in which you constantly need to be producing content, you constantly need to be producing analysis, and it's an an avenue now, in which politicization of media is encouraged, because it encourages you to get viewership.
We think that, all these things compound into a into a society in which the media is largely more politicized, than otherwise would have been without television, because of the profit incentives doing so, and it means that you create a more divisive society on the whole.
When people are constantly tuning into a media that hyperbolizes scenarios that are going on, in order to get views, in order to get attention, in a twenty four hour media market, when people are creating stories, and developing stories, out of non stories, we think it only creates more tension within the state, and creates more anger between individuals of different political views.
We think that, you also get less trust in the news, when people when people see every media outlet, aside their own, as one that's biased, and fake news, and when we and when this happens, we think that you simply get a less informed public, because people don't have sources that they can reliably trust, and reliable sources end up getting demonized.
The second thing is: we think that media, that television in large part, produces vapid content.
You've hundreds of television channels that do nothing but report twenty four hours on one specific thing, whether it be one specific channel, like ESPN or that constantly reports on a sporting event, or its reality TV show networks, or entertainment that, ascribes to the lowest common denominator, so entertainment that exist solely to attract the most views possible.
As a media format, television exists to do that, and we think as such, you get a diluted form of entertainment than you would through niche forms of entertainment, such as books, or movies, or other forms of smaller scale entertainment, that don't require competition amongst hundreds of channels, trying to vie for the most eyes at any given time.
The second thing we want to talk about is physical impact.
So, we think that, it's just it's just true that, prior to television people, spent more time being physically active.
When television became the norm, people spent less time going outside, having physical activity as their main form of entertainment, there are less social clubs that people joined, less communal gathering that people went to, because it's easier to sit in your own home, by yourself or with a couple of family members, and watch television.
It was easier to be entertained through that mean than it was to go through the physical processes of discovering your own entertainment, or finding other groups outside of your own to be entertained.
We think that, a tighter knit social circle, one that doesn't that one that doesn't exist anymore, but existed prior to television, one in which people were more creative, and more physically active, so both more active with their mind, in creating entertainment for themselves, but also more physically healthy, and more physically fit, we think that, this is a world that would have existed, if television had not become prominent, and had not become the norm.
And given that, the content television produces is largely problematic for our culture, and it's certainly a detriment to our health.
We believe that, television does more harm than good."
"The motion for today's debate is that private universities should be banned.
What we mean by this is that any universities that are currently private would either be disbanded or forced to go public in that they would be teaching government funding from government funding, and any kind of large donations coming in would also be split between all universities.
Two main areas of clash, the first on education as a facilitative right.
Because we tell you at the point that it is difficult for me to get a job or function within a society that fundamentally undervalues those and looks down upon those who either did not receive an education or come from lower classes and are less educated, then the then then necessarily education becomes a right by which I am able to access other rights.
At the point that in order to access rights that everyone agrees on, such as the right to life, the right to freedom of speech, I first need to be educated.
We tell you that it is also a fundamental right and ought be treated as such.
But also, at the point that the type of education you get determines your future opportunities, for example, if I go to harvard as compared to someone who goes to a suny, it is easier for me to get a better job than that other person.
We think this also makes it much more fundamental, to the point that everyone ought have equal access to it.
As with any right, we think it's a problem when it isn't applied equally.
We'd say that if I was taken into a room and shut the door and locked behind me, even though I can yell at the walls all I want, I'm still not being given my right to free speech equally, as compared to others, and we we would consider this a rights violation.
We think it's a problem that the type of college I go to is vastly determined by income and my family name rather than my actual accomplishments or my ability to learn.
We think it's even a worse problem when that college defines my opportunities and my future, because we don't think it's the case that harvard kids are just smarter, we think rather it's the case that harvard kids come from backgrounds that have more money, come from private schools that gave them better standardized testing prep, and have more opportunities when they get to harvard in the first place, because harvard gets more funding.
So even though suny kids are just as intelligent, suny schools just don't have the money to offer the same level of professors, offer the same level of internships at other places, have the same networking with large corporations.
This means there is a fundamental inequality of access.
Our second main area of clash is so so basically what we're saying in this first part is that equalizing our options, by making sure that everyone goes into the same types of schools with the same funding, means equalizing the playing field into the long-term for these people when they look for jobs.
Our second main area of clash is about how we make public universities better.
We tell you that, now, the same large donors that were going to invest in harvard or yale, or any private universities that their grandchildren happen to go to, are going to invest the same money in the public funding in the public system.
This money then gets displaced and actually allows public universities to get better with it.
We also say that this decreases the fight for resources that currently occurs when the best professors, the best corporations, all go to private universities because of the name recognition rather than paying attention to state schools.
When private universities don't exist, those professors have no choice but be hired by state schools, and those corporations have to network with state schools.
Finally, when people graduate with a more equal playing field, we tell you it is no longer a competition within the job market to come from the biggest-name school.
It means that I'm not getting arbitrarily shut out of a position because someone from harvard also happened to apply.
We think that standardizing this against grades is also really important.
At the point that I can be a straight a student coming from a public university and still get chosen below get get ranked below someone who came from harvard and had a much lower GPA, simply because they went to the school named harvard, is a problem insofar as insofar as there's no way to actually compare these different standards.
Is the is the name worth more than the grade?
We think it's preferable when everyone gets to go in the same kind of system.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should ban naturopathy.
We mean by this is that we would officially ban the sale and production of naturopathic medicine on a corporate level.
I think we would still be okay with individuals producing their own naturopathic remedies as long as they were not selling it to anyone and it was being used on a smaller scale magnitude but vendors who are caught selling naturopathic remedies would be fined and their stock would be confiscated.
Three main areas of clash, first on why it is bad for the individual.
Recognize first and foremost that naturopathic medicine does not work.
If it did it would have been tested in labs, it would've been proven, and we've been marketed as something that is an efficient treatment rather than a naturopathic noninvasive home remedy.
What this means is that whatever condition you were trying to cure with naturopathy whether it is chronic headaches or whether it is the fact that you hurt yourself when you fell down and you have an open wound these kinds of things continue even after you have applied the supposed treatment.
This is pernicious with small conditions like I mentioned but it becomes even worse when we talk about larger conditions.
So when someone first starts having pains in their chest but they don't check it out for a long time and just keep taking naturopathic medicine but later find out that they've been having cholesterol build up and heart disease all along, you've already allowed the condition to progress for so long that it's going to be infinitely more difficult, more expensive, and more painful to treat it now than it would have been if you had come earlier back then.
The other issue on their side of the house is that what happened these kinds of things tend to be time sensitive so if you have cancer developing in your body and you've been noticing pains and you've been feeling nauseous and you've been exhibiting symptoms but you've continually been drinking a tea that you think is likely to help then we think what happens on their side of the house is that you are infinitely more likely to not be treatable by the time you finally do end up at a doctor because you collapsed in the middle of some public event.
It also becomes more expensive because it necessitates multiple visits to a doctor in addition to the fact that you had to pay for that remedy at the beginning to solve the initial problem.
We think that at the end of the day these kinds of things are really bad for the individual especially when you think about the fact that naturopathic medicine targets two populations: those who are people who cannot afford or do not have insurance to go to a doctor or those who are so hipster and so convinced that noninvasiveness is the way to go that they are just blinded by stupidity.
I think we probably care a lot less about the latter group, they're kind of idiots, but we do care about the way that it impacts the group first people who just don't have the money for insurance and so are hoping that this does something so they can avoid going to a doctor later but given that they still have to end up doing so and often end up suffering even larger conditions because of it, we don't think that his should be something allowed.
Our second area of clash is about how it increases distrust in the overall medical system.
Look the medical system has a history of mistreating women, mistreating minority groups, and now you add to that a bunch of rich hipsters who talk about how they're going to get so enlightened by drinking tea instead of going to the doctor.
The problem that this creates is that individuals who already distrustedthe system are made to distrust it even more and this seeps into people who didn't distrust the system but now we're considering since a large portion of the population is opting for other kind of treatments that maybe they should do.
This is a problematic because although it has a problematic history the medical system is the most efficient and most likely to be supportive in terms of how it can administer care and we think that when you have these kinds of rising distrust it hurts society as a coal because you no longer have people who are going to the doctor regularly doing the things that you actually need to do in order to function that raises things like things like mortality level and disease level but it also reduce healthcare costs as a whole because it's on because given that on that more treatment is is necessary at later terms in your disease and preventative care is almost impossible.
This all contributes to rising costs.
Proud to propose."
"The social security tax is a federal payroll tax imposed on employees and employers to fund social security and medicare.
We believe, on the side of the government, that social security tax is a tool of a nanny state.
It should be canceled in favor of allowing citizens full control over their future investments in current money funds.
So we have three main points that we're going to discuss.
First is the need for funds in the present, the second is the right to determine future investments and the third is the government versus the alternatives that exist.
So let's look at the need for funds in the present.
Governments like to discuss the need for long term thinking.
But they tend to ignore certain short term needs of their citizens.
Governments tend to think in blocks.
There's the upper middle class, the middle the upper class, the middle class and the lower class.
Or there's different earning brackets.
But the fact is that real people don't necessarily fit into these blocks.
Real people, real citizens have pressing individualized needs.
Governments today are effectively cutting our earning power.
They are taking money out of our pockets and they're saying we're going to invest it for you because we know what you need better.
But there are people out there who have pressing needs.
They have to fix their car, they have to fix their washing machine, they have to pay for their parents' for the parents' retirement home because social security doesn't cover the cost of certain of certain measures.
There are lots of costs that need to be met today, that need to be paid today.
When the government takes money and says we're putting it away for your future but doesn't allow us to live in the present, we think that that's a problem.
We think that there are times where the present takes precedence over long term thinking and long term investments.
Second of all we think that the right to determine future investments must lie in the hand of citizens.
Government investment strategies are not necessarily the same as the investment strategies that many citizens would choose to employ.
There are different risk levels.
There's high risk, moderate risk, low risk.
The government shouldn't be able to choose for us how our money is being invested when it's supposed to be coming back to us in the future.
We want to be able to choose what it is we invest in.
And, as I mentioned previously, we want to choose when we invest.
There are times where I can invest more money and there are times when I have to invest less because I have pressing needs that need to be met.
We don't think that the government should be the ones determining our future investments.
What kind of risk we're taking, what kind of investment strategies to employ, we think that that needs to be done by citizens.
So even if the government had convinced everyone that it's important to invest in their future, they should still allow people to choose their own investments.
More over we think that the body that is investing our money, that is taking our hard earned money and investing it towards our future and supposed to be giving it back to us in the end, supposed to be giving it back to us in the form of retirement funds and and medicare and healthcare down the line.
We think that those bodies should be strictly regulated by governments, but the company can't regulate itself.
We think that that is also an inherent problem.
We think who is it is who's going to regulate the government if the government says actually we're out of money or changing the terms of what we promised you.
We don't think that it's an effective way, we don't think it's a safe way.
We don't think it's a fair way to determine future investments.
Third of all we're going to talk about the government versus alternatives.
The government, let's face it, is absolutely incompetent and ineffective at handling cash.
They bleed cash to bureaucratic processes.
Money goes into the system and less money comes out.
Because it just gets lost in the bureaucracy, in the number of people that need to get paid, in the convoluted ways that the government works.
We all know that social security is already running out of money.
So why do we keep investing in it?
Why do we keep allowing our government to take money, to tax us and to invest it poorly and we're at risk of not getting it back in the end?
We think that they can incentivize saving plans, we think that they can incentivize things like healthcare and that would be a much more effective way of allowing us control over our future.
Thank you"
"We should abolish personality tests.
So there are a wide array of personality tests that currently exist on the market, so we're just going to create a model to make it clear what we're talking about.
We're not talking about like buzzfeed posting a personality test that someone will take in a two minute period and then move on with their life to find out which disney character they're most like.
We're talking about personality tests that are instituted by either schools or businesses to try and see what someone's career aptitude might be or to see whether or not someone's personality may fit into your corporate culture.
We would ban the use of personality tests for these types of purposes and in any sort of official structure, any sort of long of lengthy personality tests, so like the myers briggs test we would eliminate that.
And in the status quo we see a problem of two things.
Either these tests are immensely broad, which means they don't have any sort of predictive power or they have a problem of confirmation bias, in which people may see them as personally successful, may see their personality reflected in a myers briggs test.
But that's because they see a confirmation of what they already believe about themselves or they confirm these things in their everyday life.
But we think the larger problem of all of these things is that people simply cannot be boiled down to their separate aspects of their personality.
We think that individuals are far too complex as as human beings and that the interactions between a variety of different personality aspects can lead to individuals being immensely different from each other, even if they have the same myers briggs personality type or something like this.
And we think even if it was the case that these personality tests were reflective of one's personality, if you could accurately boil down someone's personality into one personality test, we think the problem is that personality is something that's fluid.
It's something that changes over one's life and in one's environment.
For example, people often believe that one needs to have a certain personality trait to be a leader, but they need to be an extrovert, but what's been found in studies is that when individuals are given the opportunity to be a leader, they adapt to those types of traits.
See bill gates who's become a leader on the global stage, but started as an introverted individual who wasn't comfortable speaking in front of large groups of people.
We think that personality is very highly likely to fluctuate over one's life and therefore taking personality tests seriously and taking the results of these things seriously can have really bad ramifications.
For example, certain businesses use personality tests in order to judge potential employees.
But we think that firstly, personal references are much more likely to be personal and more in depth and give you a better understanding of who an individual is, secondly, as I already said, environment matters.
Which means denying someone a job opportunity simply because their personality in the past isn't what you're looking for, doesn't mean that they can't evolve to fill your work space.
And thirdly, mood has and immense impact on personality tests and the mood that you're in when you're taking a personality test, what you're thinking about in the moment when you're taking the personality test, can have a really drastic impact on who you on on what these tests say about you, what they think you are.
And we think that there is a massive problem in the status quo, people taking these things too seriously which can lead to one, an internal crisis of identity in which people believe that these tests have validity and that they have a misunderstanding of who they are fundamentally when they otherwise wouldn't have this sort of crisis of self identity, and externally, we think that there are mistreatments of individuals insofar as people have a certain expectation based on a boiled down personality type, which simply is not an accurate reflection of the person they're interacting with as a human being.
We think that personality tests simply miss the boat and don't accurately represent what a human being is and they don't accurately represent how an environment plays a role in personality.
And for these reasons we should abolish personality tests."
"We should subsidize embryonic stem cell research.
When we say that we would subsidize this, what we mean by this is that we think that there should be an immense government investment into stem cell research, so the government should put forward research funding, that's tied to certain possible outcomes of stem cell research, that's tied to investigating the potential of stem cell research, and we think that businesses as well should start to invest in the same type of research.
We think that there is a public and private investment structure that can allow for a subsidy to be created.
You can also create tax cuts for businesses that invest in stem cell research, there are number of ways of doing this.
We think, any and all options are fair.
So, two reasons why we should subsidize embryonic stem cell research: the first is ethical.
We want to say that categorically, embryos are not people.
We think that potentiality is simply a bad standard for determining when people deserve to have rights, and we think it's a bad standard for allowing stem cells to have rights, or embryo stem cells as well.
We think that, if you will allow potentiality to be a metric by which we give rights, we think that would be an immense amount of restrictions placed onto individuals.
For example, anytime that someone wanted to say masturbate, this would be something that is a horribly unethical event, because the sperm that would be lost during masturbation is potential, it is possible that that's that sperm could have became life, and given that this is the case, we think there would have to be prohibitions on a number of very personal things, that individuals want to do with their bodies, and we think that this is unjust.
Furthermore, potentiality cuts out a wide array of individuals that, we think, do deserve rights.
So, we think for example, individuals that are comatose, that don't appear to have any sort of potential for regaining consciousness, we think that it would mean that these people could be abused in any number of ways, even though they may have living wills.
Or things like this.
And we think that it simply undermines the rights of individuals in the status quo.
We also think, that the concerns of those in the present should outweigh and should regulate government action.
So, even if you think that potentiality is important, the potentiality of people that are alive, that could be helped by the health benefits of stem cell research, is also much more real, and is guaranteed.
So we think that because of this, you ought give preference to those types of people, to the people that are already alive.
We think, that there are massive potential benefits of embryonic stem cell research, these are cells that can be used in various forms of therapy, and can be harnessed in a wide variety of ways, that can change based on how they're used, because stem cells are very malleable by their very nature.
They be can used to alleviate a number of different elements, in in a variety of parts of the human body.
This is why stem cells are so valuable, it's because they're malleable, and they're versatile in this way.
We also think that it allows for the study of human development in a specific way, to see how these stem cells are able to change, and to see how we can change the cells in our own bodies, to do theoretical research.
The list of potential treatments are so wide for stem cells, that we think not taking action, not doing stem cell research, dooms many of those for ailments that are in fact very common.
Stem cell research could be used to help in treating heart disease, diabetes, spinal cord injuries, other muscular and tissue injuries, these are all things, that are not only incredibly detrimental to the livelihood of people that have them, but also incredibly common.
We think that government needs to look out for the protections of individuals that exist in the status quo.
Given that stem cell research presents an immense possibility for diseases, that are incredibly common within our society, we think it would be disrespectful, of the rights of those that are currently alive, not to subsidize embryonic stem cell research.
And for this reason, we think that we should subsidize embryonic stem cell research."
"We should tax remittances.
What we by this, basically, is that the country that the money is leaving in the form of remittances should take a tax or a portion of that money before it is allowed to leave.
We don't think that this should be particularly high, we think it should reflect the sales tax in states that have a fairly low one, but we do think that it ought exist for a couple of reasons.
Three main ones, first, on tax philosophy.
Sending money outside of the economy does nothing for the economy that you're in, which maybe would be okay if we bought into the idea that every single person owns all of the money that they earn.
The problem here is that first, you earn that money with the support of different social structures.
Like your job could not have existed and you could not have gotten to it without things like roads, without the government protecting groups from crime, all of this effort that is built in.
And sure, maybe someone might say that the response to this is that income tax happens.
The problem with that is that individuals aren't just subject to income tax when they are given money.
Sure, income tax is what is taxed directly off of your income, but when individuals go to spend that money, that is the whole point of things like the sales tax, or if you're buying alcohol or cigarettes, taxes that are specific to that.
It is just not the case that once you receive your money it belongs to you with no strings attached.
What is often the case is that when you spend that money in the same country, it gets taxed, and when you send the money out of the country and the people you send it to use it, it gets taxed.
So it's incredibly important then that the country of origin of that money gets benefited, because it's not going to receive the benefits from that money it would usually receive from other money, through sales tax and through the things that I described.
And we think that taking it taking this money out of the equation and by sending it to another country, also impacts a lot more people than just the center.
What we mean by this is that when you take that money out and it doesn't get impacted by those other taxes, that's money you're directly taking out of the pocket of government welfare services, and of other things that it would be allocated to.
Also out of the individual who you would have bought goods from, who would've been gotten paid.
Like the entire essential like train of the way that purchasing works would get disrupted when you send it out of the country, and we think that is worth paying remittance.
Our second argument is about how it is bad for the economy.
When you have remittances leaving and you aren't taxing them, it is really difficult to track how much money is available.
And even when you are tracking them, and even when you are taxing them, it is incredibly difficult.
So we think the tax essentially just makes up for that difficulty.
Because when you aren't able to track your money, it's really hard for you to use economic tools like inflation and deflation to manage unemployment and things like bubbles in the economy, because you don't understand how much money you already have in the economy, and the government doesn't have the ability to control those things as precisely as it needs to.
This is really bad, because it means that your government's economy is generally just going to be more bumpy than one in which we could track that money more effectively.
So we think that a tax is worth that kind of complication.
Our third argument is about doing good things in the country.
Recognize that this is actually a really really large amount of money, even if the amount that you tax every individual remittance is very small.
In twenty fourteen, over four hundred billion dollars left the US in the form of remittances.
So even a small tax would really add up and contribute to things like social welfare.
You can put that money into things like infrastructure spending, social safety nets, and we think that insofar as the state has an obligation to its own citizens, and and those within its borders first, you should make use of all of the tools that you could be making use of, including the taxation of remittances.
Proud to propose."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should legalize sex selection.
In terms of the model, we're not going to take a stance on sex selective abortion, specifically we're talking about, you know, technologies that allow a developing embryo to be you know one sex or the other based on the parent's decision.
And then of course like the physicians will go in and they will, you know, do the necessary technology things to make that happen.
Two independent points: the first being parental rights.
So we first want to establish what the basis for parental rights is.
And is really two fold: one is the rights of the parents themselves, to just you know have things that they like to happen, happen.
They, as individuals, have to you know go through a decent amount, like living with the kid, and that entitles them to a certain amount of latitude over you know what sort of experience they will have in raising that child.
But the second is the way in which the parents themselves are proxies for the child's best interest.
Especially at an embryonic stage, the kid isn't really capable of advocating for themselves.
And at that point then, the most meaningful proxy for the children's will, is the parents themselves.
You know in early childhood of course the parent is just the most familiar with the with the child and what the child's interests are, but even in embryonic stage the parent is still the best proxy because the parents understand best the environment in which the child's going to be raised.
So they have the best understanding of what this child will be like, based on what they're going to make that child into.
At that point then we think that sex is obviously something that has a significant impact on the outcomes a child has in life.
Discrimination against women is rampant, but there are also structural reasons, like an individual countries culture, that might signify whether it is better to be raised up a boy or a girl.
At that point then it seems eminently reasonable to allow this decision to be made by parents.
What sort of life is this child going to have, and is it going to be a positive one?
We think at that point then, if you know sex is a significant factor in the quality of the life, in the amount of discrimination or whatever the child might experience, it's it's reasonable for the parent to say: "" this will be a better life "".
Or if you personally I will just enjoy having this individual sex more.
If a child you know if a set of parents just really wants to raise a girl, that I think it's within their rights to allow them to do so, insofar as they probably have legitimate reasons for wanting that.
But the second thing I'd like to establish, my second independent point, is that the children themselves don't have intrinsic rights that can't be proxied by the parents.
I think this is true for two reasons: the first is that the kid just doesn't have, at this point, any rights at all really.
When you're talking about an embryo this almost certainly doesn't meet the standard for what constitutes a entity with rights.
If you go by pain and pleasure, you know whether or not they are capable of having specific desires and preferences, then it's almost certainly not true.
Obviously the science is still out on this, but it doesn't seem that embryos have much capacity to react to external stimuli, and at that point they probably don't have preferences.
If it's in terms of intelligence or some other standard like that then they even more certainly don't meet that standard.
They haven't developed even brains yet, so there really isn't a way by which you can apply that standard to them.
At that point then, if the entity doesn't have rights it doesn't make sense to prioritize their rights.
It makes much more sense to prioritize the will of the parents.
But let's assume that the embryo does have rights.
I don't think that they have a proactive right to the particular sex that was randomly assigned to them, you know, through, what will be assigned to them through development.
Rather, you know, since this was random chance in the first place anyway, it almost makes more sense to just proxy this off to the parents, insofar as the parents just structurally are more likely to choose something that will benefit the child than like a literal coin flip would.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should adopt atheism.
What we mean by this is that we would prefer a world in which everyone was an atheist to a world in which different religions exist such as in the status quo.
Three main areas of clash, first, on decreasing xenophobia.
Right off the bat we think that there's just no xenophobia if no religious religion exists in order to in order to be the target or perpetrator of xenophobic views.
Religion is an especially divisive topic insofar as it creates the basis of people's relationships with the world.
It explains the very big questions that teach us how to live our lives and teach us why we're here and all of that and because people oftentimes use this as a foundation to build the rest of their world view they get incredibly defensive and angry when they're questioned about it because they see their world view as threatened and it makes the entirety of their lives very fragile and we think and insofar as they would be lost without these kinds of views they get very aggressive and oftentimes violent in response to feeling threatened.
When we take away those differences, people start from the same fundamentals.
You're less likely to have a war over which god you follow.
There doesn't exist the same kind of moral superiority of because I'm a christian and you're a muslim, I have the correct religion and you don't and we think that this is actually something that is really necessary especially right now because what we see is that even though religion can often advocate for really good moral practices, it also often advocates for an in group and out group and almost always in order to keep people believing in it, tells people that they are somehow special for believing in what they believe.
We see this with judaism and being called the chosen people and we see this with christianity where they're seeing themselves as enlightened because they believe in christ and so we think that until we're able to put people on the same groundwork it is unlikely that you can get meaningful change in terms of treating people equally.
Our second independent point is about promoting rational thought.
There isn't proof of a god and almost certainly no legitimate doctrine right?
Like we know that even things like the torah or the bible were mostly man made with no proof that it was ever given to us by divine beings in fact, a lot of the nonsense in it tells us that it is very unlikely that it has been.
Religion requires people to accept information as fact without proof of that and insofar as it does so, it denies rationality on face and teaches people to take things without necessarily requiring proof for them.
This is really bad because it allows people to build a frame of mind that starts not with critical thinking but rather with sheer acceptance.
So when they are put into situations where authority figures say this is what is true, they're much less likely to question it and even if this might not be problematic on the basis of like churches or religious leaders we think that it gets really really bad when you think about people being more prone not to question authority on a like more governmental or global mobile insofar as they are often just choosing which person sounds most authoritative and then just going along with it because they were never taught to critique those power structures and so once you get rid of religion, we think that you're just much more likely to be teaching critical thinking to people because you're not requiring them to enter the world and take information as it without questioning it.
Our third independent point is about creating a better society.
Sure churches often do a lot of good.
But people should be doing good for better reasons and shouldn't be altruism because of god but rather because logically it stems from this idea that everyone is equal, everyone is human, and you're just lucky to have access to what you have and you should be doing good because of that.
So we think a lack of religion actually leads to less selective good.
You're going to be doing good things regardless of the religion of the other person or the sexuality or the race.
Where is currently a lot of the time moral doctrines say of religions say you ought be doing good to this individual as long as they believe the same as you or something like that.
We also think that getting rid of religion stigmatizes women.
Many oppressive practices rise from religious doctrine and you're much more likely to see women as people when you get rid of religious words that code them as something other.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should abandon the insanity plea.
First, because it's ultimately rather unnecessary in contemporary legal systems and secondarily, because the insanity plea is inherently speculative.
So first why is the insanity plea quite unnecessary?
In the status quo if somebody has a mental illness in order to actually convict them of a crime there's generally two criteria that have to be meet.
First, that person with a mental illness has to be seen as competent for trial and then second, that person with a mental illness you have to like prove that they weren't insane the time the crime.
So I want to talk about the first element of that because I think that the purpose of the insanity plea is by and large to ensure that people with mental disabilities are not held like to the same degree of of culpability for the crimes that they commit because they have minimal control over their actions as a result of their illness.
But it's important to note that this is oftentimes interwoven with competency in general.
So if you're unfit to stand trial then you're ultimately going to see a rather similar result to a successful insanity plea.
If someone is unfit for trial, they're probably going to be in some kind of institution forced commitment to an institution designed for mental health and the way in which the fitness for trial criteria is met is basically is this person mentally secure enough that they can understand the charges that are being given against them.
Are they able to adequately participate in their own defense things like and if they're not able to do so, if they don't have the mental capacity to do so, then they're already not fit for trial and you're already going to have other alternate measures take place that is both going to ensure that they can get the treatment that they need and insure that they're not going to be a danger to society but at the same time it also means that the trial part of itself is unnecessary and that's important because in a lot of ways, it's a similar correction but it saves the like but it saves the necessity of putting someone with a mental illness through the entire trial process and it also saves the state a lot of money too because prosecutions can be quite quite expensive especially on cases with mental health where you have to call in a whole lot of professional health experts.
So you do save a lot of money on these things and I think that's something that's very important.
A thing to keep in mind is that if somebody is competent to stand trial then you become then you have a problem because if somebody is competent to stand trial then maybe their mental illness is something that is minor enough or treatable enough that you should put the expectation on them to obey the law because while obviously some people have like different degrees of mental stability, it's important to note that there's always a duty to obey the law and a duty to ensure compliance with the law and that just because it may be more difficult for some people than other people because of mental illness, does not mean that you necessarily get a pass for the law.
So I think that only in the more extreme circumstances should you actually do this, but the next thing that I want to talk about is about the inherently speculative nature of this because when we're talking about the insanity plea by and large most most jurisdictions at least in america, but around the world, because this rule originated in like europe so most commonwealth areas are going to use this rule is whether you are able to recognize the distinction between what was right and wrong more leads like the m'naghten rule.
Can you tell the difference between right and wrong?
If you can't tell the difference between right and wrong then you're seen as mentally unfit and therefore you have a successful insanity plea.
But the problem with this is that if you have a chronic mental illness then you're probably already fit but if you're trying to make an argument about something like say maybe temporary insanity or lower level insanity, these are things are oftentimes very difficult to prove because it's rather difficult to obtain evidence of a singular point of what's going on in someone's head in a singular point in time because you can't look into somebody's head.
So it's difficult to actually get evidence on these things so it becomes highly speculative and a very problematic way to actually enact justice.
So for all of those reasons we should abandon the insanity plea."
"We should not subsidize agriculture.
So, in the status quo in many countries such as the united states, the government gives huge amounts of money to farms and other agricultural businesses to subsidize their production of food.
We have two big arguments why we think this shouldn't go on.
The first is that it encourages over production.
So, recognize that if you are paid to produce, whether or not anyone is consuming your products, then ultimately, your incentives are completely divorced from the market.
So right now, dairy farmers in the united states, for instance, produce far more milk than anybody is able to drink before it spoils.
So we see that there's lots of milk going to waste, but farmers continue to produce it anyway.
The net effect of these subsidies, is that the federal government is buying milk to pour down the drain.
We just don't think this makes any sense to use of limited government funds, to use it to support people producing milk that nobody wants.
And this is the outcome of subsidies, they create inefficiencies in the market that would be solved otherwise, because without subsidies, there would be fewer dairy farmers and there will be less milk produced and that milk would be more, like, similar to the actual demand for milk in around the world.
But we also tell you that this harms other farmers abroad.
In particular, if a country with a huge agricultural base like the united states or china has agricultural subsidies, then they flood global markets with really cheap goods and farmers elsewhere can't compete.
The reason why people in a lot of sub saharan african countries are eating american corn instead of grain grown in their own country, is that the US taxpayers are heavily subsidizing corn production in the united states, so it's so much cheaper than corn produced and sold according to an actual free market in other countries, that they can never compete, and domestic farmers in those countries are greatly harmed by this, and can't support themselves and can't continue their business.
We think that this is harmful because, since many countries promote free trade, broadly speaking we think that subsidies undermine that, and make it more difficult to have free trade across borders.
Our second argument is that we think this is an abuse of government power.
So basically what happens when you have agricultural subsidies, is you take tax money from low income people, and give it to very wealthy farmers.
Recognize that farming today is not mom and pop on some farm out in the midwest growing a little bit of corn.
It's huge multi billion dollar industry with massive companies that actually control huge swathes of farmland.
So we think that this is basically transferring money from low income people to the very wealthy people who actually own those companies and are taking all of the profits.
We think that that's also really harmful because, when things go bad because these companies are mismanaged, they can get away with it from subsidies, so the profits are all private and the risk is all public.
We think that that's fundamentally unfair to the americans who can't keep that money for themselves to spend it on their own needs, or to invest it as they see fit.
We also think that it's unfair for the government to pick favorites.
Basically, we think it's unjust that agricultural businesses get subsidies and other businesses don't.
Now, farmers might say that they're the most important people in society, but I bet doctors say that too, so why do we subsidize agriculture and not other industries more heavily, or why do we subsidize agriculture and expect certain other industries like the automotive industry to function in a more free market?
We think that you're effectively picking winners and losers here, and all companies are in a certain amount of direct competition because, if they're publicly owned they're all competing for people to buy their stocks, and to raise capital, so we think that there are real harms to other companies, because we have these heavy agricultural subsidies.
But the last point that I'd like to make, is that I think that it forces individuals to buy products that they might not want to support.
This is especially true because the agricultural industry is so controversial.
If you think about how many people around the world choose not to eat meat because they think it's unethical, we think that that's a huge amount of people, but subsidies force them to support the meat industry because if something goes wrong in the industry, the difference is made up for by the government stepping in with subsidies, so you're basically making people purchase a good that they think is unethical against their will, and we don't think that should be the role of government.
So we should not subsidize agriculture because it encourages market inefficiency and because it's a misuse of government power.
Thank you."
"I'm proud to support the motion that we should ban telemarketing.
Three independent points: first is the quality of life harms that stem from this practice.
So we think, in general, when we talk about a government ban, the type of framework that we want to set up is whether or not a that specific practice does more harm than good.
As a general rule of thumb, we try to ban things when they create significant harms to citizens that are greater than whatever benefits that they might bring.
I think this equation is often something that rests in a sort of gray zone where we're not really sure how to calculate the benefits versus the harms, but telemarketing lies in a pretty obviously harmful zone.
To begin with, we don't think it is particularly clear what the benefits of telemarketing are.
There are obviously benefits accrued to firms.
They could just sell more things.
But we think that: one, for the large part, telemarketers are located outside of the country that they are often targeting, and b, these gains are usually made in an abusive practice.
That means that there's not much of a principled like desert claim to be made here in terms of what the firm should benefit from.
For me, sort of constituent like consumer side of things, it's pretty clear that there is net harms.
That is, you know, this is an intrusive practice, one that can have like distinct harms on like, you know, having to deal with these phone calls throughout the day, like newer tricks that are like allowing telemarketers to make it look like they're calling from your home area, and we think that this creates a significant burden on the individual.
Obviously, this doesn't compare to something like, say, being like physically ill or something like that, but we think this is a distinct quality of life harm that doesn't have much of a benefit to weigh against it and as such, we should lean towards abolishing the practice.
Our second independent point, though, is that the abusive nature of this makes it disproportionately harmful on particular portions of the population.
So we think one good example of this is the way in which telemarketers seek to abuse elders, people that are usually less knowledgeable about newer technologies in the way that like, say, financial markets or insurance markets work now.
So telemarketers are often capable of putting pressure on elderly people through these phone calls, telling them something like they have back taxes that are due or telling them that they need to get this insurance for their computer or something.
Because they don't understand the systems and they don't understand the technology, they are disproportionately likely to give in to the demands of an abusive telemarketer.
We think these disparate harms then justify a government ban, because the government has a vested interest in protecting vulnerable populations.
Our third and final independent point, though, is more defensive in nature.
We think that a lot of what opposition is going to tell you is that there are reasonable ways of opting out of the system, like placing yourself on a do-not-call list, that can get you out of these harms in a way that justifies affirmative consent into being the subject of telemarketing.
We think the problem with this, though, is that the existing gray zones, particularly with the newer technologies that exist in the telemarketing industry, make it difficult for government agencies to crack down on truly abusive telemarketing companies that are acting outside of the law.
So that, like, location tracking technology I mentioned earlier is something that the FAA, or FCC rather, has a lot of trouble actually tracking down and identifying the source of.
As such, the FCC is often reluctant to crack down on an individual calling source, because they are incapable of determining of whether or not this is genuinely a telemarketer, and they act with sort of a broader sense of caution in order to avoid punishing an innocent person.
Given this, we think that allowing telemarketing to be legal at all is the root cause of why government agencies are incapable of meaningfully cracking down on the most abusive practices.
Insofar as there are very few benefits from legitimate practices and there are lots of harms from illegitimate practices, we think a blanket ban is justified insofar as it creates a legal framework that is more capable of responding to genuine issues.
Proud to propose."
"The energy industry should be nationalized.
With large common utilities, the government is usually far better at providing these sort of goods than private industry.
Particularly in the case of energy where, if you do not have access to electricity or other forms of energy, you simply do not have access to modern ways of living.
We think that this asymmetry of power and this essential requirement to have this energy in the first place means that companies can unduly abuse their customers to an unacceptable extent.
Furthermore, we think monopolies should usually be regulated by government.
Because energy is a natural monopoly, that is to say there can only be one company that owns the power lines under the streets, we think it is essential that the government controls it as they are far less likely to abuse monopoly power than other groups who are always seeking a profit.
To that end, we would propose the following model: that the electricity industry should be nationalized, that the government should take control, through eminent domain, of all power lines and of all power factories, and if companies refuse to sell them, if they refuse to give them up, the government should simply build more to accommodate the need.
Three arguments for why this is a good idea: first, on returns to scale.
We think that energy is always more efficient when it's done by a larger company.
Bigger companies can buy newer equipment, can have more workers in more areas, and there's no larger organization than the united states government.
The massive scale of the united states and the capacity of the united states to put so many resources into the energy industry means that they can make it considerably more efficient.
Being able to hire workers at a discounted rate, being able to negotiate with other individuals and contract with foreign governments to get special resources means that the government will always be able to produce energy at a cheaper cost.
We think reducing that the cost of energy is essential.
I'll discuss why energy is a social good in my third argument but, very briefly, we think cheaper energy means more innovation, more people willing to actually use the amenities that are given to them and, largely, a better quality of life for everyone.
My second argument is about how the government avoids patents.
The government will always try to innovate.
We think that if the energy industy is inefficient, if it's not effective, bureaucrats will be blamed, politicians will be voted out of office and, as such, there's always an incentive for these people to innovate in order to keep their jobs.
It simply puts a higher burden on politicians, which we think isn't very high in the first place.
We think it's beneficial for the energy industry to avoid the use of patents for a few reasons.
First, we think that innovation that occurs on the government level has no real profit incentive, so if they were to invent a more efficient way to transport energy, they wouldn't patent it and essentially hold that patent over billions of people.
Secondly, we think that avoiding patents is good as if they need to buy a patent from someone else, they have incredible leverage.
They can essentially say, "" if you don't give us the rights to your patent, then no one will ever be using your patent, "" because, once again, the energy industry is nationalized, so any energy industry patents can we got at a massive massively discounted rate.
Each discount given to the nationalized energy industry will always be passed off to consumers, which is generally a good thing.
My third and final argument is about how energy should be subsidized.
We think that energy is a social good.
The more access you have to energy, the more ability you have to produce things that your neighbors can use, to live a happy quality of life that happen to depend on other people, to be able to pay for things like wifi which other people can use if your network is open.
Generally, we think the cheaper energy is, the happier people are.
We think that direct subsidization would be good, which can occur through nationalization, but also indirect subsidization is also good.
What we mean by indirect subsidization is that the energy industry, if it's nationalized, won't be as profit seeking and as such, will generally be cheaper.
Easier access to energy means easier access to a modern quality of life and for this reason, the energy industry should be nationalized."
"We should ban alternative medicine.
When we say that we would ban alternative medicine, what we mean is that any type of medical procedure, any type of medication, any type of thing that treats an illness, that isn't scientifically tested, and shown to be effective, hasn't gone through the rigorous testing process, that exists in the status quo, we wouldn't allow it to be put on the market.
We would prohibit people from selling these things, we would ban individuals from profiting off these things, all these things we would make illegal, and we would assign hefty fines and punishments, if people were to prohibit these things.
So, we think that this is principally an argument about when the government is allowed to paternalize, and we think that there are three main reasons why the government can paternalize, and that for each of those reasons, alternative medicine fits the bill of something that needs to be prohibited, of something in which a ban is justified.
The first reason why we why the government paternalizes is because there is often an asymmetry of information, between consumers and producers, that causes a harm for the general public.
We think that is clearly the case in the case of alternative medicine.
People simply don't know, that the types of things they're doing are not scientifically proven, or they don't comprehend the significant impact of the life choice they're making.
So, we think that there are two ways in which people don't have the information that would allow them to be informed decision makers.
The first is one of simply a lack of factual information, and the second is a lack of rational information, that allows people to make informed decisions, because if someone were to have the understanding of what it means to take medicine, that simply does not work, they would understand the grave consequences of doing such things, and we think, clearly in these instances, people can be paternalized, because they haven't been given the right education,the right understanding, that society is obligated to give them.
The second reason is when there is a dire public concern.
So, when there is an immense health consequence, we think that there is a benefit to society that can be gained, that's so great that paternzalization is okay.
Recognize, that the use of alternative medicine hinders healthcare, and that people are only going to get more sick.
And the problem with this is, that when people get more and more sick, it doesn't mean that they just linger until eventually they either get better or die, this cost gets passed down onto the public.
So, there are two ways in which this has a dire public consequence, the first is that when people are sick, and they're able to spread diseases, you're more likely to get a number of people to be harmed, by the by alternative medicine, not just those that make the decision to use alternative medicine, and this means that there's severe health risk to the people in your society, that aren't making this decision.
The other is, that when people end up in hospitals, because they haven't been treated, when illnesses get worse and worse, and so medical costs pile up, and people can't afford to pay those medical costs, those costs get passed on to the taxpayer, which means that people end up paying more in their taxes, more for healthcare, than they otherwise would, if the government had paternalized.
The final reason is when there's a low impact on one self actualization, and recognize that using alternative medicine is not a bold life choice, that is an indication of who you are as a human being, that expresses your authenticity, your your your self in a meaningful way.
We think it is simply one of many decisions that are minute in the grand scheme of your identity.
Given that this is the case, we think that prohibiting and paternalizing in this instance does not cause an immense negative externality on the self, it doesn't send the message that you as a human being are fundamentally flawed, and therefore is not discriminatory in any sense.
And because of this, we think that the government can act on the other two prongs of paternalization, because of the asymmetry of information, and because of the dire public consequences, to take this action and paternalize, and to ban alternative medicine.
Because of the immense health risks, not only to the people that use alternative medicine, but to society writ large, we should ban alternative medicine."
"We should privatize postal services.
Throughout history, the postal service has been a force for good.
It has allowed people to send mail from one place to another, keeping up their correspondences and allowing them to really connect with people who are far away.
However, email was invented, planes were invented, the cost of shipping things has become cheaper.
The postal service guaranteed that any letter sent, whether it's from a city that's next to the delivery location of that letter or if it's from the tip of alaska to the bottom of florida, the postal cost will be the same, given the same weight.
This is simply not tenable at this time.
At this time, to send a letter that to someone who isn't too far away, you have to spend an incredibly large amount of money.
To send a letter to someone all the way across the country, it may be sort of cheap, but it's unclear why everyone else should have to subsidize those costs when you are trying to send something so far away.
The benefits gained from a letter are to the individual who send it and to the individual who receive it.
Subsidization should only be done when there's a societal benefit through these sort of benefits.
Given that email has allowed for almost all communication to be moved online, we don't think it's necessary to actually continue to subsidize the postal service.
As such, we would propose the following model: that the postal service continue to operate for the next six months but then shut down forever.
We think the UPS services, fedex, are far better equipped to actually cater to the whims of the public.
A few reasons why: first off is innovation.
Postal service is run by bureaucrats.
At the end of the day, the government controls it.
Even though the postmaster's there, even though there are lifelong postal workers who actually work there, we don't think there's a huge incentive to innovate.
Upward mobility is fairly lackluster.
And it's not about saving the postal service money, it's simply about working there the longest.
As such, we think that innovation does not occur at the postal service.
Free market is far better at approaching innovation because the owners of the of the company are trying to make as much money as possible.
Each time they have a major innovation, particularly when they can patent, they make a lot of money.
This means that were we to remove the government from the postal services, we're likely to see further investment into these services.
As such, we will see more innovation and the cost of letters will be cheaper than they ever were under the privatized market.
My second argument is about competition.
We think that the postal service pushes out local competition.
Although some national brands have risen up to question its authority, we think that local brands, other smaller companies, simply do not exist.
Post offices, though, are essentially a free market.
Nearly every single post office offers the exact same service.
If I go into a place with a box that is ten pounds, they'll quote me different prices, but what I actually get out of it is exactly the same.
As such, we think more competition in a free market always pushes the price closer to the equilibrium of supply and demand.
This will generally improve the price, make it so the government is not actually just setting the price for all other companies and, ultimately, improve the well-being of all people who engage in this market.
My third and final argument is that it's easier for taxpayers and that it alleviates a massive tax burden.
The postal service is hemorrhaging money.
As its services are less needed and as competition exists, it must continuously depend on the taxpayer to pay its deficits.
I don't mail anything.
I don't know anyone in my life who really continues to mail anything.
As such, it's incredibly unclear why we, as taxpayers, have to subsidize this and why private citizens don't have to pay for it themselves or, at least, not to have to pay for it in full themselves.
We think that it's fairly easy to ship this sort of mail, so the price increase that may occur due to a lack of subsidization is fairly minor and as such, the tax burden can simply fall or the the cost burden can simply fall on those engaged in the actual transaction.
For this reason, we should privatize postal services."
"Multiculturalism brings more good than harm.
When we're talking about multiculturalism what we mean is is to have a diverse set of cultures interacting with each other and existing, and co-existing in one proximate location.
This doesn't necessarily mean that these cultures are blending together in any particular way but it's just that these cultures are able to coincide and to exist with one another.
What this is, this could be compared to societies in which there's a monoculture or one prevailing social idea of how to live, or the types of food, all the things that wrapped up in what cultural reasons.
So, we're going to talk about two things: we're talk about culture as an expression of the self and culture as an expression of society.
So firstly, we think that culture is incredibly important to one's expression of the self.
We would say that society constructs the self.
That individuals are not blank slates from tabula rasa monoliths that walk through society and make themselves, but rather they are created by the society that they are born in.
They learn from the culture that surrounds them and their tastes are attracted to that which their cultures bred them to be attracted to.
So, individuals have particular desires for things that their culture dictates them to have.
Whether this is a desire to live a particular type of lifestyle or to live an active or not active lifestyle whether to pursue particular types of sports or foods or things like that.
We think that all of these, and a variety of other preferences, are embodied within the culture that one has.
So multiculturalism allows for better expression of the self and more self fulfillment.
This is for two reasons: firstly, the diversity of cultures when it exists allows for people who do not feel safe or connected to their particular culture to find other expressions and other outlets for the things that they care about.
It allows them to explore and to learn more about what the world has to offer.
About the many variety of ways in which the individuals may live, and from there to find one that is more fulfilling.
It means that individuals that feel trapped within their communities have an outlet in which they can express that express that anxiety and from there we think multiculturalism allows for a diverse group of people to live simultaneously without having to impede each other's desires.
We also think that more cultures build more diverse people.
So even if people don't feel excluded from their own culture, we think that when individuals get the type of cultural education that comes with living amongst a variety of cultures, they're able to better understand their own culture they're better to able understand their own habits their own practices, and they're more able to critically examine those things, which means that when they're problematic they're more likely to turn away from them which we think is good broadly, but it also means that they can take other cultures into their own life and become more diverse and well rounded individuals which again leads for more avenues of self expression.
Secondly, multiculturalism in society.
We think, firstly, that when you have a multicultural a multicultural society it makes it easier for other microcultures and smaller subsets of cultures to develop.
This, again, we think is preferable because in a society in which more cultural exploration is encouraged, it ensures that more people are able to express themselves in the way they want and not be demonized for how they express themselves, which we think is ultimately an expression of freedom and good within society.
We also think it leads to more accepting citizens.
So, even if you do not have the cultural beliefs or the cultural practices of your neighbor, when you're able to interact with those people and see them as human, and ensures that you don't just view culture as a monolith but as something that people take part in.
It ensures that you have more tolerant human beings broadly, because it means that individuals are able to understand that other cultures are not threats to their own, that other cultures don't impede their ability to live, and from there we think it leads to a more accepting society broadly.
When you are able to live side by side with other cultures, when you're able to live in a society in which you're not directly tied to the culture that you've been born into and you live in a multicultural society, we think that you breed a better social background and a better blending of cultures that helps people and helps maintain society.
And for that reason we think multiculturalism brings more good than harm."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban the sale of violent video games for minors.
What we mean by this is that if a person is under eighteen, they would have to bring a parent to a store in order to purchase a video game or if you're buying it online, you'd have to go through an account that would have your age as eighteen or older, we in the same way that there's like committees that rate movies as rated r or PG thirteen or NC seventeen, this would be a similar committee that basically creates a standard for when a video game is too violent for general consumption.
Two main areas of clash: the first on parental rights.
We think it's generally accepted that parents should have a say in the media that their children consume and the way that they develop.
This is why we require parental permission for r rated movies, for most social media websites, schools require permissions to take students to movies or on field trips, and the state doesn't actually regulate a line for what parents control in the home.
Like at the point that parents are allowed to give home births, make sure their child doesn't have a social security number, and then raise them on farms, we think this is a far smaller example that is protected by the state.
So, what we're talking about here is the largest violation of parental autonomy, because it takes away that check that parents are given on children's media consumption.
It's basically saying that: look, we don't care what your preferences are or what kind of political views you hold, your child can just go into a store and buy whatever you want they want and play it behind your back.
The problem with this is that violence is especially important because of how ideological it tends to be.
Parents who are pacifists or disagree with the portrayal of certain political groups in these games, such as a lot of parents really dislike how the way that russians are always vilified in video games and prefer their children not to play with that, should not have to tolerate this in their home and under their roof.
They should be able to say: look, maybe you can play that wherever I can't control you, but you could should not be able to buy it and bring it inside.
We also think that if your child struggles with violence outside of the home, so like kids who are especially violent in school and wind up in detention, etcetera, we think that parents have a right to discipline them as they see fit and not have to expose them to more violent content when these children already have a problem.
Our second area of clash has to do with long-term problems of desensitization, because we think that when you are exposed to a lot of violence in your video games, you begin to see it as normal because you're observing this violence regularly.
So, now, when you observe it in your everyday life, you're much more likely to not feel afraid of it, you're much less likely to feel like this is out of the ordinary, and you're much less likely to interfere.
We think this is incredibly important because a lot of the time, the reason that we can stop violence violence from occurring in groups or bullying in schools is because other children are willing to not tolerate that behavior and step in.
But when you're so used to violence that you no longer find it to be surprising or scary, we don't think that you're going to be as willing to step in.
We also think that desensitization also makes it easier for you to be more violent with others because when you watch people get hurt over and over and over on screen, it takes away the human part and the empathy that you would feel otherwise.
So, someone who's not used to inflicting pain on others actively feels pain themselves when they hurt someone else because of like that human part of us that emphasizes.
But if you're used to inflicting that violence, even through a screen to humanoid shapes, you take away the human part of the person that you are hurting, and you can imagine everyone is that character on the screen.
So we think that it actually makes you personally much more violent and like we prefer our children cannot grow up that way.
We also think the youth with which you learn this is very important because whereas adults already have schemas by which they live their lives in the real world, children don't yet, and when they're still forming, it's very important to make sure they form correctly.
So, things like the bobo doll experiment didn't have very much affect on adults because even when adults see another adult hitting the doll, they already have preexisting conditions that they think are true, so they already are disgusted because of their background.
But children, rather, tend to repeat what that adult is doing if they're behaving violently because they model those adults and see them as role models.
So do the ethical thing: don't let children buy violent video games."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish zoos.
Two many areas of clash, first on animal rights.
Because, we think that it is arbitrary to be born as a human, and think of yourself as superior to other animals, just based on your species.
In fact, we think that it is not only arbitrary, but also uncontrollable.
At the point that, I didn't choose to be born as a person, and presumably a monkey did not choose to be born as a monkey, we cannot we must evaluate this behind what would we have wanted, had we been born as the other, given that there was an equal chance of that happening.
But we also think that, all the other metrics by which we evaluate rights in humans, animal share in.
At the point that, they suffer in the same way that we do, in the point that family bonding occurs among groups of dolphins, or even groups of cats, at the point that they communicate with each other, and clearly have preferences and desires, we don't think there's anything left for those who do not believe in animal rights to stand on.
Okay, so they'll come up here and they'll say: but these animals are less intelligent than us.
But the problem with this is that, we account for people who are less intelligent.
So, it doesn't make sense for us to not account for animals who are less intelligent.
At the point that a baby has as much capacity as a monkey, or even less, why ought I protect baby rights, but not a monkey's rights?
If you don't buy the baby example, we think that spaces are created in human society for those who are mentally deficient as well.
In fact, we afford them more rights, because we recognize that they cannot stand up and protect themselves.
We think at the point that there are literally human beings, who have the same mental capacity as monkeys, or dogs, or cats, but we still afford them rights, then we have to afford them for animals as well.
Our second area of clash is why zoos are an unjust infringement on those rights, but also bad in other regards.
First, we think it curtailed the rights that animals do have.
If humans have rights like the right to movement, the right to life, the right to self actualize, or the pursuit of happiness, we think that if animals are seen as essentially equal, then they have those same rights.
What this means is that going into the wild, and trapping a hyena, is infringing on their right to live a free and uncurtailed life.
But even if you don't buy that we're bridging some rights, we think that the fact that we actively harm animals, by putting them into zoos, is enough to overcome all of that.
At the point that being cooped up in a cage, that is hundreds of miles smaller than the open seas, that whales and other large sea animals are used to, actively destroys the physical development of of their fins, and at the point that, wolves, and other large animals, atrophy their leg muscles early, because they do not have the same amount of space to run around in, but we think that physical harms our justification enough to abolish zoos.
But we think that emotional harms count too, right?
We think that tearing apart family units, that leave animals unable to sleep at night, or howling for long hours, or like actively showing signs of missing the animals who are taken away from them, are also grounds for protection, right?
We wouldn't accept it, if someone walked into my home, and took away my sisters and brothers, from my mother and father and said: this is just the way it is, you stay here.
We think the same applies for animals, just because they can't protect themselves, just because people are stronger than them, does not mean that they ought be torn apart.
We think at the point that, just because there are people who are stronger than me, does not mean I give up my rights, we don't think animals do either.
But if you don't buy that, we think that there's a higher order pain verses lower order pleasure trade off, right?
At the point that we recognize that, animals suffer because of being in zoos, but all humans get is a little bit of pleasure, we think the trade off falls in a way that animals ought not suffer, because humans don't suffer from a lack of zoos, but animals do suffer from being in zoos.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"We should ban gratuities.
We think that tipping staff at restaurants, drivers, and similar employees, should not be permitted.
We think that there should be laws preventing people who provide services from asking for gratuities, and that business owners should have to pay all of their staff a fair wage rather than rely on tipping.
So in jurisdictions where the minimum wage is lower for tipped staff than for other people, we think that they should be given the same minimum wage as anyone else, or even be paid the same amount that they are currently with tips.
A few points for our side.
The first is that we think tipping leads to lower wages.
When you have lots of people tipping a certain type of profession, for instance waiters and waitresses in the united states, we think that there's a natural inclination for business owners to pay those people less.
For instance, if you own a restaurant in america, you know that basically all of your clients will leave a fifteen to twenty percent tip for the staff.
So you know that your staff are going to get paid this tip and you're able to pay them less, and then if they complain, tell them oh, but you get tips.
Now, in some jurisdictions, people are guaranteed to get a minimum wage if they make less than that amount, but oftentimes this is used as an excuse by business owners to pay people very little and treat them relatively poorly.
For instance, in many US states the minimum wage is as low as two dollars for people who are expected to receive tips, so if you work on a slow day, or if your business owner has some sort of unsavory tactics like intentionally giving certain employees a job where they're less likely to be tipped, then you can end up making much less money.
It's also difficult for people to plan and budget when the amount that they take home every day is entirely dependent on the generosity of the patrons.
It's completely out of a waiter's control whether a person orders a huge expensive meal and leaves a big tip, or whether they just get a cup of coffee and leave a few cents.
So we shouldn't punish them for this, especially when the business owners are still making a lot of money off of every order.
They can afford to pay people, they just don't want to.
And if a restaurant is so badly run that it would go out of business if they had to pay their staff a few dollars more an hour, then maybe they should go out of business rather than be subsidized by the generosity of the people who eat there.
Our second point is that ultimately tipping is demeaning to workers.
It effectively requires them to grovel and beg in order to receive a wage that they need from the people that they serve.
Waitresses, for instance, are often forced to just sit there and take huge amounts of abuse that other staff would never be expected to put up with, in order to get a huge tip.
For instance, if people don't like their food or how it's prepared, oftentimes you'll see them yell at waitresses or treat them very poorly and then leave no tip.
So this not only forces the waitress to be extremely polite and take all of this abuse in the hopes of getting a tip, but also puts them at risk of not being paid at all.
We can see the same things with drivers being taken advantage of, such as being asked to idle and then not being paid for it, when people have all this leverage over their service employees based on tipping.
So we think that ultimately, it reduces these people to a lower standing than the people who would be tipping them.
It creates a huge power imbalance between the customer and the employee.
Whereas normally the employee would be able to refuse someone service or tell someone that they're being rude, ultimately they can't do that when they rely on this person's good will in order to receive any amount of money.
And this is only exacerbated when you have larger imbalances of power.
When wealthy people or people from wealthy countries visit poorer areas, oftentimes a tip from someone visiting can make a huge difference to someone's life, which means that these people are even more incentivized to grovel or beg from these people, which we think is demeaning to them.
They deserve to have the same dignity as anyone else, and tipping takes that from them.
So for all these reasons, we should ban gratuities.
Thank you."
"We should definitely raise the retirement age because the aging because this is just a problem that is urgent right now, and it's something that we absolutely need to make sure that we fix before it becomes too big of a problem to deal with, and I additionally think that there's not any real or inherent harms to raising the retirement age.
So let's start by talking about the urgency.
Because they think that there's a number of factors that make raising the retirement age something that we have to do immediately.
There's first the fact there's a lot of aging baby boomers in our society.
There secondarily a lot of population decline, people aren't having as many children as they used to.
Third there is a lot of general economic stagnation across a lot of western economies and, finally I also think that the there's there is also an increasing quality of healthcare, which means that people are living longer.
So all of these things combined, create a very bad time because, all of this means that you're going to be having a bunch of healthy people retiring in the very near future, who are going to be living for decades longer, they could be living for another thirty years, forty years, and that presents a real problem because when these programs were instituted, as far is to make them economically feasible, they were implemented with a much shorter time frame in mind, because standard retirement age of sixty five back in the nineteen thirties, would be pretty reasonable if you only thought you're going to live probably into your sixties or seventies.
But now people are living into their eighties and nineties, and maybe even up to a hundred, and these are all things that the state has to foot the bill for, if you're not going to be able to have enough money raised for this.
And this creates a really big problem, because you're going to see a lot of things like social security fund going broke, a lot of like insurance backup plans going broke an all of these kinds of things, or people defaulting on their ability to playoff pensions, all of these things that are that could be absolutely catastrophic for elderly people.
So, I think that the only thing that you can do from there is increase the retirement age.
By increasing the retirement age, you keep more people in the workforce for a longer amount of time while they're healthy.
You make sure that people aren't settling for getting all these government benefits , unless they're people who truly need them in the later parts of their life, not thirty years before they die.
All of these things are very important to note.
So, the other thing I wanna talk about is about why this move of raising the retirement age is, doesn't actually have all that much harm to it.
So the first thing I wanna talk about other than this is that, you don't have any intrinsic right to retire necessarily like, it's definitely, like the fact that you're getting old doesn't mean that you have necessarily the right to all of these government benefits at any specific time, especially if you are deemed still able to actually do things.
And I think that therefore, we can determine the need that people actually are having these things.
So, that's important to note.
And it's important to note because I think that, people, there's no real harm to making people work longer.
Like, people may be lazy or people may feel tired of their job or people may be old, but that doesn't mean that they still can't work and they still can't do their job for a longer amount of time, for another ten years, since they are going to be living for a long amount of time.
It just means that people are going to be working longer that's the real harm.
And I think that most people are still capable of working for a longer amount of time.
And I think that our retirement age as a bright line is inherently arbitrary and foolish anyway, because keep in mind that if you're like a fifty year old coal miner you're probably going to be much more in physical need of retirement than a seven sixty five year old lawyer.
So, the the bright line with retirement is already arbitrary meaningless as is, we might as well, just make sure that we can raise it so that way it's actually going to be economically feasible.
So, for all those reasons, very proud to propose."
"We should cancel the affordable care act.
We are arguing that we should repeal the affordable care act commonly known as obamacare in the united states and go back to what we had before where every state set up their own insurance regulations.
Some states like massachusetts would have a law similar to obamacare, ironically called romneycare in that case, other states like north carolina or virginia would be free to have more of a free market system in place.
Under obamacare people are required to purchase insurance and insurance companies are required to offer every consumer insurance through a series of what are called insurance exchanges.
In many states however there's only one insurance company available, in most cases a company called blue cross blue shield, and people don't have very much choice as was originally envisioned by lawmakers back in two thousand eight and nine.
With this in mind we have three arguments for our side.
The first is that obamacare is unfair to healthy young people.
The idea behind obamacare is that you can drive down insurance costs for ill people and elderly people by forcing healthy young people who don't really need health insurance to buy in.
So basically the way the system works is prices are subsidized for older people and much higher than they ought to be for younger people.
If you think about it as an insurance company, basically you're betting on whether or not your client is going to become ill.
A twenty five year old with no history of illness is very unlikely to develop something this expensive to treat.
Maybe they'll break a leg but ultimately it's unlikely that they'll cost your company very much money so you can give them a very cheap rate.
On the other hand, a sixty five year old is almost certain to have some sort of illnesses and injuries over the course of what remains in their life so you should be able to offer them a much higher premium in order to offset that risk.
Obamacare sought to level this out by forcing everyone to purchase insurance.
But ultimately this means that young people are going bankrupt in order to subsidize health care for older people since older people are one, generally wealthier than younger people and two, often haven't tried to live very healthy lifestyles.
We think it's unfair to foist the cost of their health care onto young people who haven't done anything wrong.
Our second argument is about how obamacare has harmed choice for patients.
When obamacare was put into place people were told that they would be able to pick their doctor.
But this was quickly proven untrue for a few reasons.
First of all, we've seen that as insurance companies have gained more and more clients they also have more bargaining power relative to hospitals.
Insurance companies now tell their clients they have to go to certain doctors or certain hospitals because they're called in network and out of network.
So many people had to stop seeing doctors they've been seeing their whole life.
They also don't have a choice about if they want to do things like see a specialist.
Ultimately it's up to an insurance company whether they'll be permitted to do this.
So we think that individuals have seen their freedom to control their own health care greatly curtailed by the obamacare system and therefore that we should cancel the act so that individuals have more control over their own health.
Our third argument is that insurance companies are abusing obamacare for their own benefit at the expense of taxpayers.
Consider that right now the insurance companies are guaranteed millions of customers and they don't have to do any work to get them.
People are fined if they don't buy insurance, so rather than have to attract customers insurance companies can just sit around and do nothing.
In particular, because it's expensive to offer health insurance, many states only have one provider available.
So they basically have a monopoly.
In this way blue cross has been able to take advantage of the american people by driving up costs while providing lower and lower quality of service because there's effectively no competition.
Obamacare was touted as an alternative to the private or public system that we see in canada that would allow the market to look create competition so that companies would have to compete with one another and offer better services but the opposite has actually happened.
So for all of these reasons we should cancel the affordable care act.
Thank you."
"Tower blocks are advantageous.
Tower blocks, otherwise known as high rise apartments or skyscraper apartment complexes, are a means by which you can fit more people into a small space by building up and building apartments on top of each other, as compared to things like urban sprawl which maintains like normal heights of buildings but spreads it out over a larger geographical distance.
Alright so firstly, we want to start by recognizing the obvious fact that in the status quo tower blocks are often recognized as things that are either incredibly impoverished, they're communal housing projects run by the government, they're welfare projects that have harm such as substandard living conditions, violence in these communities things high rates of drug use things like this, or they're incredibly affluent only a very select group of people can afford them because they're right in the center of a place like new york city, but recognize that none of these things are an essential aspect of tower blocks.
There's no reason why the government can't provide better living standards for the people that live in these situations.
They can't build better tower blocks that ensure that the living conditions are good.
They can put these things in more reasonable sections of of urban areas or they can't do what they need to do to improve these urban areas by cutting down the over policing in the and the discriminatory policing systems that cause these to be problematic areas.
Tower blocks themselves as a concept, we think, are actually crucial for the status quo in the world we're living in.
Recognize that the trend in the world is towards urbanization.
More and more people are moving towards urban cities and urban sectors and more and more people are going to need to fit into these areas.
If the the comparative in the sense is one about efficiency, if you don't use tower blocks you lead to urban sprawl.
Urban sprawl because more people are going to come to these areas which means either you have things developing like massive slums which are even worse living conditions, or you get massive ecological damage by spreading the city out so so so drastically that you have to cut down you have to cut down local ecosystems and environments and you need to do serious damage in order to allow for the amount of space that you need to fit millions of people.
But we actually think that so we think this is a more efficient use of space to have these tower blocks.
We also think that this trend is a good one and it's one that should be encouraged by increase housing availability.
Urban areas are great hubs for individual accomplishment.
They're good for the economy because there's a large sum of money and a lot of expendable resources in one area which means there can be a wide variety of markets, products, services, all in one sector which means you can have a lot of niche forms of entertainment and service available to you which only improved your life.
Is there is much higher access to job opportunity because you're not limited to those jobs that you could walk to, or you you're not limited to a few dozen jobs within your town in a small locality or where you can drive to and commute to work, but in a large city there are thousands of corporations and thousands of different businesses looking to hire millions of people in order to run their businesses and these are often the businesses that are the most affluent.
The best well paying jobs exist in urban areas because these are where the hubs of technology and business in the innovation exist.
They're also better access to public resources and education because there's more money to pull from.
There's more funding to pull from and it's easier to distribute things such as health care at a clinic or something like this if this clinic is located in an area where more people are populated and therefore things like this end up happening more often in urban areas.
We think that human progress is easier when people are able to get access to jobs, to economic resources, and to other opportunities that are only available when they're compacted in an urban area and we think that tower blocks are the way to ensure that these urban areas aren't drastically harmful to the ecosystem around them and use space in an efficient way that allows more people to join in on the success of urban areas and for these reasons we think tower blocks are advantageous."
"We should protect edward snowden.
So for anyone who's been living under a rock since twenty thirteen, edward snowden was an NSA employee who defected from the united states.
He went to hong kong at first and then ended up in russia.
He has applied for sanctions in many other countries but ultimately because he leaked information about illegal acts taken by the US government, he is at high risk of being sent back to the US to face a life sentence and possibly other penalties as well.
So right now he's trapped in russia.
So with that in mind, our first argument is that what we mean by protect is ultimately to give snowden asylum.
So there's a few reasons why we think snowden needs asylum.
He currently lives in russia as a temporary resident.
He has a three year permit that has to get renewed every few years.
This means that snowden doesn't have a lot of security.
Ultimately, it's going to be very difficult for him to acclimate back to a normal life and to go on to be a productive member of society as long as he has to worry about getting this visa renewed for completely political reasons that I'll return to in just a little bit.
But we think that asylum is also important because many countries around the world have benefited from snowden's actions.
Countries like germany, for instance, learned the extent of US spying on their own government officials as a result of snowden's sacrifice.
So we think that in as much as other countries are benefiting from his work, they ought offer him asylum as well.
It's unethical to let someone else suffer when you've benefited from the work that they've done and you could easily help them out.
So although it might create a sort of diplomatic snafu for a short period of time, we think that other countries that have benefited from this information including russia, ought be willing to offer snowden permanent asylum rather than bouncing him around with temporary residence.
So our next argument and the most important one in this debate, is that we want to remove snowden as a pawn in US russia relations.
The united states very much wants edward snowden back so they can find out first of all, what other information he may have that hasn't been released, second of all, what he told russia that he didn't tell the washington post and the guardian because presumably he didn't give the newspapers everything he had and thirdly, so they can make an example of him by treating him absolutely horribly so that future whistle blowers will hopefully be dissuaded.
Meanwhile, russia can hold snowden over the US as a bargaining chip and also as a way for putin to exert his influence over the rest of the world through soft power by demonstrating that he is able to protect snowden from the united states while also using him to his own ends.
So we think that if snowden were given asylum in another country like germany or france, that ultimately it would remove him as a pawn in international relations and force the US and russia to actually have adult conversations rather than rely on this kind of cold war era cowboy spying that's going on surrounding snowden right now.
And our last argument is about ultimately, what would be best for the american people who had been affected by snowden's leaks.
Ultimately, what snowden it was a huge benefit to the american people.
Many experts had suspected that US spying on american citizens had reached enormous levels but no one could prove it until snowden came forward.
So in the future if we ever actually see privacy reforms, which unfortunately have not come forward since both political parties are pro spying but if we do see major reforms, it will be because of the information that snowden brought us.
So he's been tremendously helpful to the american people as a whole and given us a great gift by making people aware of how the NSA spies on us so that people are able to avoid it if they need or wish to do so.
Ultimately he's returned the ability to choose privacy to the american people and by protecting him we would be repaying part of that debt.
So for all of these reasons, we should give edward snowden asylum.
Thank you."
"We should legalize the ivory trade.
So, the sale of ivory has been banned since the early nineteen nineties.
We think that, that ban should be lifted internationally.
Before we get into our arguments, I just wanna be clear that we're not saying: you have open season on elephants, down in sub saharan africa, what we're saying is that, the trade of ivory, that has already been harvested in the past, should be permitted, and we think that, if in the future it's possible to sustainably harvest ivory, such as from naturally deceased elephants, then we would be principally okay with that as well.
So two main arguments for why the ban should be lifted.
The first is that it's not working.
Elephant populations are on the decline again.
Immediately after the ban, in the mid nineteen nineties, you saw a slight uptick in elephant populations, but that is now been reversed, and they are at their lowest rate yet.
It is the definition of insanity to do the same thing and expect different results, so why should we expect that the ivory ban will save the elephants, when in fact the opposite is happening?
They're continuing to be killed.
We see that, the demand for ivory is being filled, regardless of whether or not the trade is legal.
At that point, banning the ivory trade seems much less effective, than carefully regulating the ivory trade.
If there were a legal way for people to acquire ivory, then it's much less likely that they would go through illegal back channels.
After all, they run a certain amount of risk that shipments will be captured, or that they'll be arrested for having illegal ivory.
If people could get it legally, even at a much higher price, we think that they would prefer to do so.
So therefore, we think it would always be preferable to regulate, tax, carefully monitor the ivory trade, rather than just to ban it outright.
We think that, that is part of what has led to the uptake in poaching and increased devastation to the elephant population.
Our second argument, for why we should legalize the ivory trade, is about the effect that this would have on african economies.
Recognize that, many countries, like south africa, are sitting on large stockpiles of ivory, that was harvested before the ban, or that has been seized from poachers.
They don't just destroy it, after all, when they capture it.
These are countries that desperately need development, and that are sitting on lots of capital that, they're not allowed to use in the form of this ivory.
We think it's very likely that, if a country like south africa were permitted to sell this ivory, that they would better be able to protect their elephants.
Recognize that, highly developed countries are much better at managing their wildlife, and at preventing poaching, than desperately poor countries.
We think that, if you encourage development in sub saharan african nations that have large elephant populations, or in india for that matter, where you have lots of elephants, we think that it's much more likely that, you would be able to protect the populations that exist, and help them to recover.
Right now, effectively, the protection of elephants relies on international charity, or on desperately cash strapped governments.
We don't think that that is sustainable.
We think that, you need to help these countries to be able to support the elephants on their own.
And in particular, if elephants were seen as an asset, rather than a liability, as a potential source of revenue, we think it's much more likely that countries would protect them, and limit the harvest of illegal ivory, in order to be able to capture the money from the regulation of legal ivory.
So, you would align the fiscal and ethical duties of the state by doing this.
We think that, in our world, it's much more likely that you would still have elephants around in a hundred years, because to be clear, the trend right now was that, elephants are going to go away in a few decades.
They'll all go extinct because of over hunting.
Drastic action must be taken to prevent this from happening.
Legalizing the ivory trade may seem like a counter intuitive way to do this, but if you give people, if you attach people's wallets to the well being of the elephants, then we think that, ultimately, it's much more likely that they will continue to be around.
Because greed is unlikely to go away, even if elephants are at risk.
So for these reasons, we should legalize the ivory trade, thank you."
"We should end mining.
In this round we're going to make a few arguments about why we think that mining should be ended, but first a model.
We're going to say that mining should be phased out over a period of say ten years and that we would like this to be some sort of a global policy.
Maybe this is agreed upon via treaties the the mechanisms of this we don't really care too much about so over a ten year period we would lower the rates of mining and after ten years it would be illegal to mine on earth.
For main arguments, the first is about harms to the environment.
Heavy machinery that is required for mining, the amount of technical know-how that is required to do this mining, ultimately pollutes the surrounding area whether it's allowing soil contamination to happen which makes it less fertile makes the the area less fertile and doesn't doesn't just harm like people in the fact that you can't use the area around mine shafts in order to actually grow crops but it also causes ecosystem degradation which harms the surrounding wildlife.
In addition to this, mining can cause earthquakes in some instances especially if it's done improperly.
So we think that mining is ultimately a major factor especially for the areas in which it's done for harming the environment.
Given our given the immense amount of ecosystem degradation that's going on due to human activity, we think that this is unacceptable and we think there are alternatives which we'll get to later.
Secondly mining is a very dangerous job.
First of all, mining is just a harsh condition to work in.
The people that are working in the mines have to experience immense heat, they have to deal with things like inhaling ash and soot which could ultimately lead to long term life problems such as lung cancer and different types of lung diseases and it's also in this is compounded in developing nations whereas maybe in developed countries protection for miner for miners is slightly better but in developing nations there's very little worker protections at all which means people can be subjected to very long hours in these conditions and can lead to and and the lifespan of these people can be dramatically decreased because of their job.
Third, let's talk about how we can recycle resources in the status quo.
We think it's preferable to to recycle existing resources given the harms that mining causes to our environment and to miners.
There are tons of landfills around the globe that are filled with precious metals, that are filled with other types of non-precious metals, all these things that are resources that can be reused if only we took the time to actually go through our landfills and take care of them and to go and put them through a recycling process.
We think that you solve for the harms of mining when you shift to this type of production, when you actually go through landfills and start to recycle the products that are being tossed away by people negligently and it doubly solves another problem which is the fact that landfills are taking away immense amounts of space, take incredibly long times for to degrade and for the the the process of decomposition in these landfills it takes a very long time in some cases hundreds of years for products in landfills to decompose so we think you're doubly solving for problems by ending mining and shifting to recycling instead.
Finally we think that in the next ten years astromining is going to be an amazing replacement for the status quo.
In the near future astromining will be possible.
There are businesses that are investing in in the technology that will not only allow us to get to to get to asteroids but also to mine those astroids when we're they're.
Given the fact that there are literally thousands of asteroids in our solar system, that those asteroids can contain as much gold or as much precious metal as there is on the entire earth, we think that there are nearly infinite resources available to us in the asteroid belt and that if we shift to this type of reduction of mining we will get infinitely more resources at very low cost which is only going to benefit the economy.
For these reasons we should end mining."
"The right to internet access should be protected.
By this we mean that people around the globe should inasmuch as there is infrastructure have access to the internet in a relatively unfiltered way.
We're okay with things like limiting access to adult content for children but broadly speaking, we think that adults should one, be able to access the internet and two, be able to access whatever content they want on that internet.
Three arguments for this.
First, freedom of speech and assembly.
We think that in today's globalized age with the internet access to online materials has become an integral part of both the traditionally protected rights of freedom of speech and of assembly.
Why is this so?
So in terms of freedom of speech, many of the most important fora in the world for discussion are now online.
People don't really exchange physical newsletters anymore or subscribe as much to physical journals or magazines.
They rely on the internet for access to this type of information.
So when you limit the right to internet access and you limit the right to choose what you consume on the internet you're limiting people's right to consume the speech of others and to expose others to their own speech in a way that would be unacceptable offline and in terms of freedom of assembly, we think that there are many important communities online and that people ought to have right to access to.
Even if we think, for instance, that it's distaste for people to join certain political groups we think that if they would have the right to join those groups in person, they ought to be able to affiliate with them online and those organizations web pages will not be banned and people should be facilitated in joining them.
In the same way that we have roads and things like that to facilitate people participating in freedom of assembly in the physical world.
The other team needs to explain to you what the fundamental difference is between physical space and cyberspace and I don't think that they'll be able to do so.
Our second argument is about how this is a check on government abuses.
What the arab spring has shown us is that when regimes are abusive the internet offers a powerful check on them.
People before the internet might have felt like they were the only ones who are experiencing some sort of prejudice or like there wasn't a critical mass of people who were unhappy with the government.
They lacked a tool to organize.
They lacked the ability to see what the rest of the world was like in order to know if their treatment was commonplace or acceptable.
With the internet you were able to see things like the organization of mass protest in countries like tunisia and egypt in a few hours.
Thirty years ago, it would have taken days and days maybe even weeks to organize a protest with a hundred thousand people, but today with technology like twitter it's possible to do it in a matter of hours.
We tell you that this is a huge threat to autocratic governments that don't treat their people well.
The knowledge that with the internet people will be able to protest.
Internet access should be guaranteed so that governments have to treat their people well lest they be afraid of these protests or even of having their government toppled.
The internet in other words keeps governments honest and we think that that is a good thing.
Our last argument is that censorship is by its nature bad.
We think that when you censure certain ideas that you don't actually challenge them you just make them hidden.
People will think that those ideas must have merit and be dangerous because they're being censored.
On our side of the house when we allow these ideas to be spoken openly, when we allow people to use the internet to engage with different ideas we think it's more likely that poor ideas are challenged and overturned rather than entrenched because they're banned.
We think it's more likely that people will have a free exchange of ideas and that out of this marketplace of ideas you will have the best possible forms of government and society emerge.
We concede that many cultures have become more liberal since the adoption of the internet and I don't necessarily mean that politically, but I mean in terms of tolerance.
You see more acceptance of things like gay rights in the world today than you did before the internet and part of that is probably the ability to spread narratives about, you know, what gay people are really like and what they actually want from society rather than harmful narrative spread by the traditional media.
With the internet more people can speak their voice and censorship that shuts that down such as limiting access to the internet will only be a bad thing only harm discourse.
So for these reasons the right to internet access should be protected."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition the motion that we should further exploit unconventional oil.
Three independent points.
First is that exploiting these sources of oil will increase the global supply.
So I think the reasoning for this is fairly intuitive.
Just you know if you are you know mining more sites, if you are extracting more crude oil and unconventional oil, you're just going to have more of it in the global supply.
This is two impacts.
First is that you decrease costs.
So obviously with there's scarcity in a market costs go up and there's a lot of ramifications to shortage in the oil supply.
You know this is something that goes into you know shipping industry which affects basically every good that we buy from other places.
This is something that fuels energy for our homes.
This is something that basically keeps our economy running and when it's prices go up that has a dramatic effects on the broader economy but secondly, it decreases oil insecurity.
I think a large portion of why there's a lot of fluctuation in oil prices is because there's a lot of fluctuation uncertainty over capacity to actually continue getting oil in the long term.
One driving factor of this is that instability in the middle east drives a lot of uncertainty and whether or not current oil wells will continue to be accessible in the long term.
Iran for example generates a lot of uncertainty surrounding this but I think another justification for why this is true is because there is uncertainty in the breath of how many places we could actually get oil from.
So when you introduce this new option, when you introduce unconventional oil, you have more certainty just by virtue of the fact that you have more sources to bring oil in from.
You're also just by virtue of the fact that the alberta tar sands are in canada also getting it from more traditionally stable country that is you know less likely to have political complications that would block you from having access to that oil but I think in the long term, this is just a better way of accessing a stable global supply of oil and that ensures some degree of price stability because there's investor confidence.
Our second independent point is that it increases capital for green researchers.
So I think a lot of what op is going to say is just talk about how like you know these tar sands and things like that just create a lot of pollutants.
So with regards to green technology, which I think is just sort of the solvency for the environmental problems with oil, a lot of it the research and the funding for this actually happens at oil companies because you know these energy companies like exxon mobil for example, understand that in the long term oil is a finite resource and that they will eventually need to transition to other things.
Obviously having more sources of oil increases the capital that these companies have on hand.
It increases their capacity to actually fund green research.
So I think in the long term you actually get quicker realization of these technologies when you increase the amount of capital flowing into the institutions that do the lion's share of the research.
Our third independent point is more just sort of a broadly accelerationist point and that's the political pressure that's generated by these new sources.
So there obviously is a large dust up from the environmentalist movement about these types of sources.
There is uncertainty regarding the amount of pollutants they generate.
There's a lot of hand wringing with just the fact that we're opening new wells.
So I think what happens here then, is that you increase the political pressure to divest from oil broadly when you have these easily attackable sources of oil.
Like if you take the interpretation that what we should be doing in the long term is getting off of oil and transitioning to green technology, I think that that's largely a political case that has to be made.
We have a lot of the technology that's necessary to do it already.
What we need is the political pressure and I think if you start getting oil from these sort of like dredges of the earth places that are pretty objectively bad for the environment, I think you actually get the political pressure necessary to make that leap.
So even if the short term has like an intrinsic harm in terms of the amount of pollutants, the long term looks a lot rosier because you were able to achieve the goal a lot quicker.
Proud to propose."
"Internet censorship brings more good than harm.
So obviously we need to set the parameters of this debate.
We think that clearly when we're talking about this debate it's a certain types of censorship are what we're discussing.
So what we mean by this is we don't think that censorship that is politically motivated is within the parameters of this debate.
This type of censorship that is done based on trying to repeal people's ability to see corruption, the ability for people to have an understanding of what's going on in the government and to silence different political parties, we think that those types of censorship are problematic but rather, we think that internet censorship as it actually happens, trying to avoid things like hate speech and the dumping of private data, the way that internet censorship ends up working in liberal countries in reality is what actually brings more good than harm and that's what we should be discussing in this debate.
So we're going to talk about a few things and why internet censorship is so important.
We think that anonymity leads to huge harms that need to be avoided for individuals.
So firstly, anonymity has led to the increase in cyberbullying and the spread of images and data dumps.
What this looks like is that individuals wind up having sensitive photos stolen, or through hacking of their private information, have their data stolen that can reveal very sensitive information about them, and that information can be published anywhere on the internet from anonymous individuals who it is very difficult to track down.
When you don't censor the spread of this information, what ends up happening is that people's privacy is violated in a fundamental way.
And it's not like these people have the ability to opt out of technology.
It's become so synonymous with our society to have things like a smartphone, a computer, all the things in which you would store data that can be hacked.
And given that these are basically requirements of where we live now, when people's privacy is violated within these things, it's crucial that the government censor those types of things.
Especially when it comes to things like cyberbullying amongst adolescents which has drawn to record high suicide rates over the past decade due to how people have been treated on the internet with anonymity and we need to ensure that those types of things do not happen.
We also think it's easy to to form hate groups on to assemble on the internet.
It's very easy for these things to happen.
So with open forums on websites like 4chan and reddit it's very easy for hate groups to come together even under very overt signs of their hate.
Even under making forums on the internet that explicitly speak positively of groups like the nazis and the KKK.
And because of the fact that you can be anonymous on the internet, people are more willing to come together and discuss in these forums to talk about their hatred and to speak it openly because they know that they can't be scorned scorned for these types of things in their real life.
They can't be given they can't be excluded from their social connection within their neighborhood, within their community, because no one will know about their anonymous feelings, about their private feelings.
When you allow these types of groups to gain leverage or to gain traction on the internet it leads to people making stands in real life, it leads to people feeling hatred in their real life, it leads to these groups because they feel empowered, because they're able to connect with so many people that they may not have been able to do in their local communities and makes them more likely to come out and to try it makes it more likely for these individuals to act in reality.
And we think that internet censorship of these types of forums allows for protections against this.
Finally, it's important to recognize that no free speech is absolute.
The internet is a forum for people that speak their mind and that's great, but free speech can be used to harm people in a multitude of ways.
When lies can be pervaded on the internet through fake news, when privacy can be dumped without people having any sort of control over these things, when hate can spread through groups like the KKK being able to actively organize on the internet, all these things require government censorship in order to avoid rights violations outside of the internet.
We don't think that internet censorship means that you need to hide that you need to censor legitimate news organizations or that you need to censor different political organizations but in the way in which internet censorship is actually done in the status quo, we certainly think that it brings more good than harm."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that national service in the united states should be mandatory.
What we mean by national service is mandating some sort of a public sector work, it doesn't have to be you know with the traditional sense of national service in the military, we would expand it to a more modern sense of national service, which would include working in a government agency or really just any sort of public sector work.
We probably wouldn't extend it nonprofits although I guess that's like more debatable.
So three independent points: the first is a sense of national pride that's really instilled by working you know directly for the government.
I think often there is sort of a disconnect between how we as individuals form our identity and the the country that we exist within.
Having that sense of national pride, that we identify with our country, is important.
Because it creates a sense of camaraderie amongst people that live within that country.
I think this is often you know kind of straw manned as this like really conservative like like chest thumping patriotism, when in reality it's actually something that brings people together in a way that's really important.
That shared national identity is often what makes us care about those that are less well off within our own country.
You know for people that have trouble empathizing with those that are less well off, I think one way to really compel them to care about these people that are suffering is to say: "" well these are your countrymen.
These are people that share something really intrinsic with you. ""
And that thing that you have in common can be a serious point in getting them to really care.
So when you then create national service, you create that sense of national identity that is much more powerful by virtue of your now stronger connection to your country, I think that goes a long way in creating that sense of empathy for people that are also in your country and might be less well off than you.
Our second independent point is that this is something that is redistributive in nature.
So when we compel people that are often wealthier, that probably wouldn't have to do this sort of work, wouldn't be compelled to work for the government, you're much more likely to see this as something that really forces people who often would not contribute much to people who are less well off, as engaging in work that is.
You know if you have someone that's really wealthy but working for the welfare office, that's important.
Because it ensures that they're doing something and it really gives back and you know gives them essentially a stake in the well being of their country and the well being of other people within their country.
They give something back in that it contributes to you know the general good.
Our third independent point is that it increases the the desirability of public sector work.
So I think one of the things that really drives the the fact that the the public sector is so much less efficient than the private sector, is simply desirability of the work.
A lot of the time people devalue the public sector as something that's inherently bureaucratic and they would never want to touch it with a ten foot pole, but they haven't actually tried working in the sectors.
And so there's a flight of particularly talented and wealthy individuals towards the private sector, that results in a gap between you know how how effective these two sectors are at actually getting things done.
But if you increase the desirability of public sector work by actually forcing people to experience it and experience you know that that the positive feeling of actually doing something that helps people on the ground, I think that will go a long way to creating a sense that the public sector work is something that's worth doing.
And that in turn means that you have a workforce of people that are acting in the interests of the general good rather than simply you know go into a private sector job at goldman sachs or whatever, looking out for number one.
Making a lot of money, and caring less about the the welfare of others.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that organ donation should be mandatory.
We're modeling this in the united states and obviously no one is tearing away the organs of the living.
This will only apply to you after you are dead.
Your your body belongs first to the government and they may take your organs and donate them either to research or to any people who might need them before giving your body back to to your next of kin who can proceed with any burial or other post-death options.
Two main areas of clash.
First that when it comes to organs there are no rights to the dead.
So there are two main ways in which we usually assign rights to people or animals.
First is in a pragmatic sense.
Is it good for society or good good for the entirety of like a society or an individual to give these people their rights?
A second way in which we say there is something intrinsic to being a person, to being conscious that says because you are innately a human, innately conscious, you get this human right.
The problem is that dead people qualify for none of these.
There's nothing pragmatically good about letting them keep their organs.
In fact it is often pragmatically harmful insofar as those organs could be better used with someone who needs them more.
Dead people don't need their organs anymore regardless of what they thought they would need while they were living.
There's also no innate humanness that applies once you are dead, given that in order to experience an innate human right, you first have to have a consciousness that qualifies you for it.
Given that dead people do not have a consciousness they don't get a human right to their organs either.
So I'm assuming that so like now we've shown you that the dead have no rights to these organs, but op is going to come up here and talk about how people have a right to religious rights.
Two responses.
First it's unclear why these ought continue after death.
It seems selfish to keep your organs given that you can no longer use them, you no longer even know if you have them, and someone else is going to die because of it.
If anything, most great religions would dictate that given that you are saving a life this is a much better use of your organs in the first place.
But second, they won't know what happens with those organs either way.
Once you are dead you cannot conceptualize or understand what is happening to your body.
As such, we don't think that there is anything religiously important about what happens afterwards as long as before you were dead, the person had come to terms or thought about what where their organs are going.
But even if you think that they might have some right, we think the government can take those rights away.
Recognize that when you become part of a society, there is an unspoken social contract that occurs where the government says that you lose certain rights for the betterment of all society and you get certain protections in return.
This is why we often have gun limitations or limitations on our mobility without certain like certifications because we recognize that in order to make a safer society, you also have to give up certain rights in advance.
And we think that if you start stipulating mandatory organ donation, this simply becomes part of the social contract and people cannot rally against it because you are giving back to the society that is benefiting you.
Our second area of clash has to do with why benefits to society outweigh everything.
Even if you think the dead have some rights, they are massively outweighed by the rights of those who are still living.
We need to understand exactly how big of an issue a lack of organs is.
Thousands of people die every year and even more have to go through painful treatments such as dialysis or other life support kind of treatments while they wait for an organ on a donor list.
And more and many don't even do it for religious reasons.
A lot of people choose not to donate their organs simply because they forget to check the box or feel like they aren't very comfortable with it at the moment.
They're very arbitrary reasons that probably should not exist.
We can save these lives and also use these organs for valuable research simply by requiring it to be mandatory especially there are often needs types of research such as those that require child organs which currently never get satisfied because parents are sentimental.
But if organ donation is mandatory then you're actually going to meet these kinds of needs.
For these reasons, proud to oppose propose."
"We should abolish the filibuster.
Three main arguments: first, on why it is anti-democratic.
We think it is incredibly unjust that the minority gets to put a stop on a on democratic proceedings, not even with an actual minority, not with a group of people who represent a specific interest, like maybe there's oppression of minorities going on, but the problems of the filibuster isn't even that, right?
It's just one single individual who can hold up an entire country just by having their stamina working, just by going up and talking for a very long time.
We build our nation on democratic principles that say that if the representatives of the populace have a majority enacting a policy, then it should go through.
We live in a country that respects the desires of the majority and says, "" this is what should occur. ""
It is completely contradictory to our entire democratic system to give so much power to one person, but also to disrespect the power of the majority so much to literally say that even though you have gone through the correct channels, even though you have come up with the right opinions, you still cannot enact the policies that you prefer because of this one individual.
So it's like a bidirectional problem where it's both an issue of giving one person control, but also an issue of taking away the power from the people who need it, and who deserve it, and who rightfully have it.
Also, recognize that it is completely arbitrary.
Whether or not someone has the stamina to go through with a filibuster doesn't depend on how much support they have or whether they're doing the right thing, it only depends on how much physical and mental stamina they have so that they can last for so long.
This is why the filibuster is bad as a general concept.
Because even if sometimes it is used for good things, there's nothing that guarantees it will be used for good things, but we know that it is always undemocratic, so we should vote on that first in this kind of debate round.
Prioritize that which goes against those core principles in instead of the side that maybe says, "" look, sometimes it does good things. ""
Our second argument is that it is inefficient.
You're literally just spending hours of time doing nothing, and this wastes citizen tax dollars, because congress gets paid either way.
The electricity to that building is working, the lights are on.
It's a problem that they can filibuster, because it essentially means they're wasting time on the population's dollar.
It also leads to government shutdowns.
Filibusters in times of emergency often lead to shutdowns which are incredibly bad for the public image of the united states, but also stall the running of the country in other ways.
Like government-supported internet domains get shut down, people who work for the government get stuck doing do get stuck without their work or without their pay, and it massively contributes to gridlock, because it literally just prevents policies from getting through, right?
Like, someone can go up and filibuster a policy and it's just not going to happen, and also you're not going to talk about other potential policies because you're busy filibustering.
And that's really bad because in a country where we struggle with getting policy passed in the first place, because of the fact that there's this bipartisan system and people don't agree with each other, we think adding another way in which you are preventing people from being able to pass policy, IE, the filibuster, is really problematic.
Our third argument is that it reduces faith in the government.
People see that the rules don't mean anything when they see that the faith of their country rests on one individual choosing to hold up proceedings whenever they want.
The problem is that we have a very real code of conduct and laws that dictate the way that laws should be passed or not, and it's problematic that there's this random loophole someone can activate at any time just because they don't want a law to get passed.
It means that all those previous regulations and democratic safeguards don't matter because at the end of the day, democracy can be stalled by one person, in a diaper, reading from doctor seuss.
This produces backlash from the people on the other side of the filibuster as well in that the individuals from the party that isn't filibustering, it is trying to get those laws passed, now have a direct incentive to not work with that other party in the future.
So you're also just going to have more gridlock down the road as consequences of this filibuster, even if they are not direct consequences.
Proud to propose."
"Social media does more harm than good for four reasons.
First because it it harms it harms productivity and encourages laziness in a lot of people.
Second, because it further empowers and enables abuse and cyberbullying of many kinds.
Third, because it's harmful for quality educational discourse, particularly in political context.
And fourth, because it's ultimately unnecessary for all the benefits that it has anyway.
But before we get into that, let's start by talking about the model.
By this obviously we're not talking about banning social media.
We're talking about a world in which we wish it doesn't it just didn't exist.
And further, I also think that when we're talking about social media, we're talking about more broadly public forms of social media, something like twitter or facebook.
But things that I don't think fall into the scope of this are more private forums or even private facebook messages or private groups, things that are more for like a close-knit people that could be helpful for communication.
I don't really think that that's necessarily what is the heart of this motion.
So, let's start by talking about productivity because it's estimated that people waste an incredibly large amount of time on social media.
I certainly know from my own experiences that hours are wasted away just scrolling through facebook, looking at random things, looking and seeing what random people say, things like that.
You could be doing anything else, you could be doing nothing.
That'd probably be more relaxing for you.
Maybe people would be less, you could be sleeping more.
People are oftentimes overtired.
You could be getting work done and not procrastinating until the last minute, all things that you could be doing a whole lot better without social media.
The next one is I think an incredibly important issue because social media has been incredibly incredibly major in further encouraging things like cyberbullying to happen.
When you look at things like like hashtag gamergate or like like or as a tool of like all right and neo nazi abuses or things like that, social media is oftentimes used as a tool to target people.
And while these may not be incredibly widespread necessarily, these isolated cases can be incredibly harmful to the few people that they affect.
The bullying can result in like essentially like doxing of people so like it's available on the internet, all of someone's private information like where they live, what their phone number is, their email addresses, things like that.
So social media is essentially enabling an environment where a whole lot of people may even have to like like leave their homes, they may be worried about or like constant identity theft.
They can be worried about all these kinds of things, and I certainly think that this is an incredibly major harm that we have to be aware of.
But social media is also a big problem because it enables false discourse.
Especially in wake of the recent election of president donald trump.
This happened oftentimes on the heels of fake news or news that is wildly inaccurate.
So you could have a report that would say hillary clinton murdered twenty people because she's evil or something like that and suddenly, because of the way social media algorithms work, it's it's ultimately like a it's a snowball effect in which some people start sharing it and then more people start sharing it, and suddenly it pops to the top of everyone's newsfeed, but there's no real way to confirm the veracity of a lot of these things.
And even if you can, oftentimes the damage is already done cause people already internalized the message.
So this is very bad because what you do is you get stupider people elected, you have less based and grounded discourse.
It's going to be more vitriolic discourse in a lot of context too, which is less conducive to progress, all things that I think are quite bad for actually reaching good solutions in society.
But finally, it's important to note that social media isn't necessary to anyone.
People might think it's necessary but it's not actually necessary.
You can if for communication purposes, email is just as quick and fine.
You can use private messaging, group chats or things like that to get messages across, to post things, to share ideas and communicate with people, websites, it's not like the internet is going to go away.
You can still find things instantly on a more credible website or the like.
You can share pictures if you want to on like other avenues with your friends.
These aren't ultimately necessary things.
But all of the things that I've talked about so far are very urgent things that are unique problems of social media that are quite bad.
So for all those reasons, social media does more harm than good."
"We should legalize ivory trade.
So in this round we're gonna make two broad arguments.
The first is a little more extreme.
It's about how animals do not have rights and because of this we think that any harm that comes from ivory trade is simply not valid and the second, is about how even if you believe animals have rights, regulating the market to cut down on black market power is the better way to protect those animals rights.
So firstly, on animal rights.
We would say that rights are an essentially human construct.
That they don't come out of the universe or the ether or anything like that.
That they're created by our societies in order to protect human beings and to protect those that we feel are a part of our social fabric.
These animals are not a part of our social fabric.
They're not a part of the societies that build these rights and therefore to ascribe rights to them would only be because humans want them to have rights.
It's only because we see some sort of validity and value for ourselves in animals having rights which is why, for example, we get pet's rights because we have a we value those pets in a way in which we want them to be protected.
There are two big reasons why we don't think animals should be afforded rights.
The first is because they cannot reciprocate those rights.
One of the major ways in which rights are validated within our society is through reciprocation and that is also how rights are taken away within our society.
It's how we validate our punishment of criminals because they have violated the rights of others and did not reciprocate their obligation to uphold the rights of others.
Animals do not have this capacity and therefore should not be endowed with rights.
The second reason is they can't internalize the value of rights and therefore to give them these rights has no real value because they can't plan in the long term knowing that these rights exist.
They can't understand the intrinsic value of the protection that rights provide but even if you don't believe that animals shouldn't have any rights, we'd still say that that to allow and legalize ivory trade is better for animals.
Why is this?
In the status quo poachers and black market sellers run the ivory trade and make a massive profit off of it.
The ban of ivory trade means that the supply of ivory is suppressed dramatically, making the business more and more lucrative.
This means additionally, that the prohibition is lead to higher levels of poaching because when there's such a low supply of ivory coming in and it becomes so valuable any ivory you can get, people will take the risk of poaching even when there are laws put in place that have tremendously bad outcomes for poachers and the level of exclusivity of ivory leads to higher levels of demand as well.
Because people know you can't just get ivory anywhere, you can't just buy like you can buy a diamond, ivory becomes a status symbol and the demand for ivory goes up even though the supply is going down, again, making these prices much higher.
We think that regulating the market solves this problem.
When you open the market it drives down prices.
It means that people who already have ivory can go out and sell it freely without it being confiscated or destroyed.
It means that ivory becomes less exclusive and therefore the demand for ivory goes down and the prices go down.
There's a less lucrative business available when it goes from the black market open to the light and there's on balance less hunting.
This accomplishes the goal of the ban anyway, which is to prevent animal populations from being harmed.
Yes, this means that there's more sanction killings of these animals but there's less killing overall because the demand for ivory goes down.
The supply for ivory from outside sources from non-animals goes up because there's already ivory out there in the market that people have and people are going to be able to sell that freely on the market.
This means that in on net fewer animals are harmed when you make the ivory trade legal.
On top of all that, we would say that animals may not even deserve to have rights and given that that is the case, people should be able to trade and use ivory however they see fit but either way, whether you care about animals or not we would say that we should legalize ivory trade."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish no-knock warrants.
What we mean by this is that if I am a judge in an area and I have a request for a no-knock warrant, I would no longer be able to give them out, and like we just wouldn't we wouldn't make it a thing anymore.
So first, right off the top, we think it's really important to note that the benefit that no-knock warrants supposedly provide are incredibly non-unique.
At the end of the day, it's incredibly unlikely that someone is going to be able to hide a bunch of illegal activities or completely cover up everything that they're doing within the two minutes that it takes for police to bust the door in after the doorbell isn't answered.
Because recognize that in the status quo, when you have a normal warrant, it's not as if you knock on the door and they don't answer, you just walk away, right?
Like, police knock on the door, they announce that they're police officers, and they bust through if nothing else is going on.
So, we think that at the end of the day, it's incredibly unlikely that people are going to be able to hide anything away during that time, especially since it's not as if you're usually doing this with high-level criminals.
We think a lot of the time no-knock warrants are given out much more often than they should be, and you end up using them for just basic drug dealers or like very small-time criminals that it's definitely not worth being used on.
Three main areas of clash, the first on why it is undemocratic.
Recognize that humans have a right to have a right to privacy and that it extends even until you are up until the point that you are proven guilty.
The problem with no-knock warrants is that they presume your guilt before they are actually proving that you are guilty, given that they have to show that they are like doing something that is worth violating your rights.
They're already assuming that you're doing the thing they're coming in to catch you doing.
We think this is really problematic given that individuals who are often the target of no-knock warrants probably didn't do anything that should disavow them from being used for this.
We think that like oftentimes these systems are incredibly racist and incredibly biased, and so a lot of the time, it's infinitely more likely that a person of color is going to have a no-knock warrant used on them than someone else.
We also think that it elevates the fear within society.
We think that you need to let people feel safe within their rights.
You can't just have caveats that tell you that those rights go away at certain times.
Like at the end of the day, it's really difficult for someone to predict whether or not they could have a no-knock warrant used against them, because the standard is adjudicable, based on individual cases, by a judge.
So we think what this does is creates a world in which people can never predict the consequences of their actions, which is which is contrary to that of what a justice system ought be doing, especially one in a democracy such as the united states.
So we think that like this actively goes against creating a consistent judicial framework.
Our second area of clash is on why it's dangerous.
Splitting this into two areas, first about why it's dangerous for police.
Recognize that people don't expect someone to come busting in through their doors, as is what happens with a no-knock warrant.
So what this actively feels and looks like is a home intrusion.
We think you're infinitely more likely to be violent, because the response to a home intrusion and armed men busting through your door tends to be some kind of act in defense.
This is when you get wounded policemen and dead policemen, because someone had a gun and their right to bear arms was being protected, and someone was busting through their doors and invading their space.
We also think there's an element of protecting individual people.
Police are when they are running through these doors are in an incredibly excited and aroused state.
This means they're going to be infinitely more trigger-happy as they're pounding your door down than had they just come in calmly, not expecting a confrontation.
We think this is incredibly magnified for people of color because of racism and racist tendencies, especially within the police force.
We see that police force forces are already very trigger-happy when it comes to people of color, and we think that it just gets a lot worse when you're coming in with a no-knock warrant and you see someone who's trying to defend themselves, but you register that as a as someone coming at you and as a threat.
We think this is especially dangerous if there are children around because they're likely to get caught in the crossfire.
Our third area of clash is just that it increases the mistrust in the police force.
We think that a lot of the time, these are used in shady situations against the people who already don't trust the police that much, and we probably shouldn't give them more reasons to distrust us.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should subsidize higher education for two big reasons.
First, we should subsidize it because it's very good for the economy overall and secondarily, we should subsidize it because, on the more individual level, it's also obviously economically good, but it's also very important for social mobility and individual empowerment.
So, let's talk about what we mean by subsidizing higher education.
Obviously, subsidizing higher education does not necessarily mean entirely free education.
However, obviously, we are going to defend a world in which we substantially increase public subsidies for higher education, compared to the status quo.
We also don't think that this necessarily has to be available to everyone.
We think that we're we're perfectly comfortable in giving out greater subsidies in the forms of greater need-based aid, rather than just more general lowering of prices of education, and also increasing the extent and availability of public loans for education.
Oftentimes in the status quo, public loans for higher education have much more generous terms of repayment and much more generous interest rates than private loans do, and but they're oftentimes not available to give as much money which fully covers the cost of public education.
So that's another thing which we want to correct for.
So, why is subsidizing higher education good for the economy?
When you exist in a highly developed country, you predominately are going to see your economy be a service sector based economy or a more technologically focused based economy.
And this creates a problem because it means that there's going to be a lack of a comparative lack of cheaper labor-based jobs or cheaper manufacturing-based jobs.
This means that oftentimes the economy necessarily requires that most people have a higher degree of education, a higher extent of education for working in just like higher quality jobs.
So this means that a necessary condition of your employment is oftentimes going to be getting a college education.
And in the same way in which the reason why we fund low primary and secondary school is because those are necessary parts of your employment in a lot of cases.
This is very similar for higher education so that makes sense too.
So, we obviously don't want a whole bunch of people unemployed, because a whole bunch of people unemployed is lost productivity, and it's also just a drain on resources which isn't very good either.
But additionally, this is also important because there's going to be when you don't have as much money that you're making, you're also just going to have less money that you're going to be able to pay for things.
So, when you have a higher paying job work or if you're more educated, you're gonna make more money, and that means you're going to be able to consume more, which is also good for the economy.
Additionally, and this also ties in to the feasibility point, we think that this is going to be a long-term investment that is going to pay off.
And it's going to pay off because more and more people are going to once they're like better educated are they're able to work better jobs, they're able to innovate more, this is going to be better for the economy so this is going to cover the costs of the subsidizing more.
But we additionally, in the short term, think that there is certainly available money for this.
Maybe just spend less on the military and more on education and helping people.
That sounds pretty good to me.
So, the next thing that I want to talk about is about individual empowerment of people.
And on the individual level, it is still often too difficult and too inaccessible to afford a college education.
And this is particularly true given that college education around the world, but particularly in america, sees its expenses rising rapidly which prices out a whole lot of people, even people in the middle class.
And this creates a big problem because it means that you're oftentimes, if you're not able to even afford college, you're locked into essentially the cycle of poverty, or you're not going to be able to have as engaging discussions or you're not gonna be able to have as like engaging an educated population as well, which means you're also more likely to have foolish political decisions like the election of donald trump, or denying climate change, or things like that.
So it's very important on the individual level as well to make sure that people can go to college, to make sure that they're productive intelligent and beneficial citizens and so that they can be empowered to break out of the cycle of poverty.
So for all of those reasons, we definitely think that you should subsidize higher education."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should subsidize investigative journalism.
Just some brief modeling: what we mean by subsidize investigative journalism is that we would have individual governments put more money into either grants that would encourage existing news corporations to add more to their investigative journalism departments and subsidize specifically that portion we would provide scholarships for individuals who want to enter into investigative journalism just general acceptance and encouragement of investigative journalism as a prospering field that we would want more representative, more existing.
Three main areas of clash.
First about promoting the free press, because I think we need to recognize that in order to have any system of democracy we first have to have a functioning free press that can work within that system.
I think what's really important to recognize here as why this is true is that it is incredibly difficult to have a democracy if the people are not informed.
This is because it becomes very easy for dictators or people who want power in the region to misinform the populace using their own news sources and they don't have anyone to check against them.
So what investigative journalist does is it allows ordinary individuals who might not have power in other regards to be able to take that power from other individuals to make sure that they are being countable and democratic and inform the general populace that that general populace can then make decisions that can be in alignment with democracy as a general standard.
And so we think it's actually promoting the free press and like creating a world in which we check our politicians through investigation is fundamental to creating a democratic state in which individuals aren't oppressed in the first place.
Our second area of clash is about undercutting the tide that we have seen of rising conservative values and general fascism.
Like we think we see this in many countries with the rising support for with the election of donald trump within the united states the rising support for anti-immigration and liberal policies and in like countries like germany and france and turkey we see pena nieto maintaining power in countries like mexico and we say that this is vastly because they are able to do things that control the main television lines the main newspapers and the main radio stations of those countries such as pena nieto's ability to control the only two existing television corporations within mexico and without that they wouldn't be able to do that.
So we think that given that this is something that we see the world as a whole from suffering from right now we think becomes incredibly important specifically at this moment to combat it even if you don't think that generally this is something that promotes democratic values.
Because we think what we do on our side of the house is we provide individuals with the ability to break out of these kinds of habits, break out of this kind of like general trend and to be able to check your politicians to recognize whether you actually want the kind of policies that they turn out to be in acting.
And we think that like one of the best ways to do that is to subsidize a field such as investigative journalism where people are encouraged to go out and actually do things that can unveil large networks that are of like corrupt government officials and like inform the public to be angry about these kinds of things.
We also think this is really important in terms of keeping corporations accountable eventhough we've been talking about governments a lot.
Like I think one of the ways in which corporations are able to keep power in capitalist societies that might have very strong democratic regimes such as the united states is by doing a lot of things under wraps such is not reporting how many human rights abuses they have or having investors who are who like benefited off of the housing crisis and things like that so I think that the only way in which you ever to again that is through investigative journalism.
But finally I think it's important to recognize that encouraging people to enter these kinds of fields is also really important.
We live in a world that is becoming more and more STEM focused and although STEM fields are very important we think that we have to also encourage and show people that there are still demand for those who want to enter humanity related fields.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should protect the free market.
What we mean by this is that we prefer a world in which governments minimize punitive taxes such as those created to discourage consumption such as the tax on cigarettes or taxes on marijuana in a lot of states, taxes on alcohol and minimize government subsidies.
So what we mean by that is like the government will often subsidize certain types of fuel production we would eliminate as much of those as possible.
Both of these are tools that artificially manipulate the market and so we prefer a world in which there was less manipulations, the free market could solve for problems on its own.
Two main areas of clash, first on how it encourages innovation.
Recognize first and foremost that innovation is something that's difficult and stressful product process.
It requires a lot of start up capital, long hours, the freedom from government regulations to engage in that kind of research in the first place, and without the free market the government controls the means of production which poses two problems to innovation.
First only things that the government wants get produced ie if you live in a very liberal or conservative state the kind of things that will regard like due to like based on the government's affiliation the kind of things more likely to be produced will be skewed based on that political affiliation regardless of what the majority of individuals desire.
But second it only uses government resources so once there is no more government funding or if that government funding is getting prioritized into different piles there's only so much of it and past that amount you cannot like add, right?
This is bad because the government will never have enough resources or allocate them well enough for all the necessary or good stuff we need.
But it also means that even if they decide that something is going to be necessary or good, it isn't necessarily the case that consumers are going to want that product.
So the cool thing about the free market is that you don't run the risk of millions of dollars wasted on something that isn't going to do well because consumers will just illustrate early on that's not a product that is desirable.
Whereas in the case of the government producing something like this the government just keeps going and it's too late to like undo all of those resources and consumers are just kind of stuck with it.
If we want people to take risk personally and financially to start lick corporations, to do research, and technology innovation we have to have an incentive that makes all of this pain and suffering worth it.
That incentive is monetary success in a free market system but otherwise doesn't exist other than like maybe arbitrary prestige that people don't really care about especially when it's at the cost of hours and hours of stress and like massive risk to themselves.
So we think that the government can never provide as much as much as private investors can and we think the things that these individuals do in a free market are really really important.
These are the people who are responsible for things like drug development, technology research, like the fact that we have things like anything from epipens to smartphones all depends on the existence of a free market that not only allows individuals tools to initially create this but also creates a world in which they are capable of competing with other corporations to make sure that the end result product is the best possible.
So we actually think that competing for money creates competition which creates better products which creates a better world for consumers.
But our second area of clash is about why this is most democratic.
Recognize the free market depends on consumer interest.
Product won't take products won't take off if no one wants to buy them so it gives the majority of power to consumers rather than government because because society will reflect what the majority desires.
This means that people's physical needs are often taking care of.
It also means that consumers control the price so necessities are much less likely to be incredibly expensive because the demand for them is so high that it there are multiple corporations all working on providing them at a reasonable price.
I think a really good example of why the free market solves for such things would be the soviet union which regardless of the fact that so many people had demand for bread the fact that the government only had a limited amount of resources to split between all different needs meant that individual starve like starved over time because the government couldn't provide all of that.
So we think it's actually incredibly important that the free market exists and be protected.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should further exploit unconventional oil for two big reasons: first, because the further exploitation of unconventional oil will lead to a drop in oil prices, which will make just about everything in our lives cheaper, and secondarily, because it'll give us independence from foreign oil, which is certainly beneficial from a like geopolitical perspective, from a strategic perspective in international relations.
So, let's start by talking about why this is going to lead to a drop in the prices of oil, and why that's so important.
So, it's going to lead to a drop in the prices of oil because you're just going to have more of a supply of it.
There's a lot of untapped things, like oil sands, or like shale oil, things like that, that are being extracted, and there's a lot of new opportunities for more advanced ways to extract oil, which is leading to a large surplus of oil, which is what's leading to the price drops in oil.
This is incredibly important, because cheaper oil prices doesn't merely means that, your cars are going to be able to go to places for less money, although that is very important, sense most americans commute to work and get a lot of their day-to-day provisions through their car, so that is very important.
This also affects things like public transportation, and a lot of other sources of transportation.
It also affects things like basic heating and cooking costs, as a lot of places, especially in the northeast, use oil for their heating.
It also affects just about anything that uses plastic, so plastics are used in almost everything in day to day lives.
Plastics use oil, so when the price of oil goes down, the price of anything that uses plastic also goes down.
At the end of the day, these costs pile up a lot, and a decrease in the price of oil means that, it's just much easier for the average person to live the their day to day lives, because the cost of living just goes down, they're able to do things on a lighter budget, which is just very helpful for people in an economy, it's a great way to get an economy going.
But, the second thing that I want to talk about is about foreign oil and about how this is going to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.
So, first like principally, if all of the reasons that I talked about in my last point, about how important oil price stability, and especially if they can be lower, how important those are to an economy, because how much they affect the day to day life.
Those are very very important things that, you don't want to have based on the whims of an oil cartel like opec.
Because, if they decide that they want to increase oil prices, or do something to increase the prices of oil, what this means is that, they essentially have control over your economy, because they're able to make things more expensive for every person that is in your economy.
That's an incredible degree of control that another government is going to have over you, which means that they can use that leverage against you, to try to like get more favorable like business proposals in some cases , looking the other way on, possibly, human rights abuses that may be happening, support for more despotic regimes, there's all kinds of ways, in which foreign governments can use this as leverage, in order to get what they want out of governments like the united states.
And, that's incredibly problematic, because it can undermine your values, it can undermine your economic interests, and it undermines the economic livelihoods of the citizens in your country.
So, that's like very very bad also.
There's also the more tenuous idea, about how you don't want this to be like, maybe linked to terrorist organizations or things like that either, which can also be the result of like state funded terrorism, which can also sometimes happen when you are purchasing from certain countries in the middle east.
And this is also sometimes a problem, like a lot of like members of the saudi arabian government have been linked to terrorist like have been linked to funding terrorism and things like this.
These are also things that , you're not going that many problems if you're trying to use unconventional oil, things like oil shales, like in canada or north dakota, or things like that.
So, for all of those reasons, very very proud to propose."
"We should end athletic scholarships.
So, for the sake of this debate, we'll assume that we're talking about scholarships that are granted primarily to students, like minority students, disenfranchise students, that excel in sports and that in return, they are obligated to participate and compete in one of the college or university's sports clubs.
So the first thing to say here is that we need to understand that the institutions use these this tool in order to track and to hunt down young promising talents and add them to their teams.
It's not that they're truly interested in justice or in allowing these minority like these poor minority kids opportunities in life.
They only want to win because for certain reason, americans care far too much about sports competitions between colleges and universities to the point of near obsession.
Why does this matter?
Because eventually what happens is that the institution has the incentive to allow these students to train and and and like practice as much as possible and to focus as much as possible on the field and on the court and not in their studies.
So, although there are allegedly, like, academic requirements and they have to pass tests and so on, they are either being overlooked or sometimes like the university actually helps out the student to cheat in the exams in order to pass and so on.
Now, obviously, this isn't always the situation and there are exceptions, but that's pretty much the spirit of things.
So, this means that this title or this degree or this diploma that this student is going to receive by the end of his studies will not really be earned.
This turns it meaningless.
And this is bad also because it's like unfair to all of the other students that did have to study and work hard to to receive it, but also because this harms this very student himself that didn't really learn anything and that is going to find himself, later in life, like whether he goes and has an an athletic career this that will end one day or if he doesn't succeed without important basic knowledge in life.
But before the other side jumps and says: yeah, but what about the comparative?
Is it better that this like that this youth is just going to live out in the street or whatever?
Here is the true counterfactual.
We say that we can and we should still invest in in like granting scholarships to disenfranchised populations, without tying it to sports, though.
And we can still recruit young promising athletes to for to like junior league clubs that will open up the like gates for them to reach major leagues in the future.
There's just no need to tie between the two of these things.
And the last thing that I have to say, and I sort of touched on that earlier, is that these scholarships help feed the obsession that these institutions of higher education have with winning in sports competitions.
This turns into a sort of like a race between colleges of who is able to recruit the fastest quarterback or the or the tallest basketball player, as if we're talking about NFL or NBA or something.
And I think that this has crossed the reasonable like line of healthy competition.
There's nothing wrong in having a college league and holding sports events and championships between representatives of different colleges.
Hell, I represent my university in the debating league.
But as soon as this stops being like a fun extra activity, a a bonus alongside the actual studying part, and start being the main concern of the students and even worse, the main concern of the institution itself, we have a problem.
And it's not just because this gets too time-consuming and comes at the expense of academic work, but it's also because, you know, in sports, like in sports, friendly rivalries can quickly escalate to like real animosity between rivals.
And universities are institutions that need to work together, to cooperate, to hold mutual projects and researches, and instead they become busy with hating each other and just like only thinking of how to like beat the other team, the other college in football.
And this like already defeat defeats the entire purpose.
Without scholarships then, it's likely that things will go back to the the healthy proportions.
Support this motion."
"We should legalize doping in sport.
So we're talking about steroid use, human growth hormone, all of that good stuff, and by sport we mean, you know, track and field, anything that would be an olympic style event we think would constitute sport for the purposes of this debate.
And it'll legalize we think that not only should it be allowed by a country's criminal justice system, but also that regulatory bodies like the international olympic committee, or national bodies like the national basketball association, should allow the use of these doping techniques.
So three arguments for you.
The first is that we think that it's unfair to set arbitrary limits on what substances are and are not okay.
Recognize that banning a substance is always a post hoc thing.
What we mean by that is that scientists or doctors or trainers are always looking for new drugs that will give athletes some advantage over their peers, and these drugs can't be banned until after they've already been in use enough that they come to the attention of the regulators.
What this means is that if you're an early adopter of the drug, you get to use it while it's still legal and nothing bad will happen to you, and you get a bunch of benefits, and then later adopters get punished.
We think that this is grossly unfair.
You shouldn't reward some athletes for being willing to discover a new drug before it happens to get banned and then moving on to the next thing, and then punish someone else for doing the same thing a few years later.
At the end of the day, we think that first of all it's arbitrary what is and isn't allowed.
There were many things that are allowed for so called medical purposes and not allowed just for the benefits of the steroid, so people have fake medical issues.
But on top of that, we think it's arbitrary to say that, oh, it's too much of an advantage for someone to take this hormone, but not too much of an advantage for someone to take that hormone.
At the point where nobody is competing completely natural, we just don't think you can ever draw a fair line.
The other side of this debate needs to draw a clear line in the sand for when doping suddenly becomes unacceptable.
Our second argument is that the optics of so called cheating harm sports.
So recognize that whenever a major athlete gets caught doping, there is a massive amount of backlash, many people stop watching the sport, and you lose a lot of fans.
A good example of this would be barry bonds.
Barry bonds was a player in major league baseball a little more than ten years ago who was one of the best guys in the league, and ultimately got caught using steroids, and there was a lot of backlash.
The media was up in arms over the fact that barry bonds was a cheater, people were angry at at the MLB, the the league for allowing this to go on.
People were angry at his team for presumably sanctioning this behavior.
I think that a lot of young people probably didn't play baseball because of their parents' reaction to this whole scandal surrounding barry bonds.
And ultimately that's the worst thing that can happen as a result of an athlete doing something that's questionably ethical, is for this behavior to change the way that young people look at the sport.
Because if in the future, fewer kids are playing baseball as a result, then that hurts the quality of play, it hurts our nation's ability to compete internationally, and also we think that there's something intrinsically valuable to a cultural institution like baseball in the united states, or like football in other countries.
And ultimately, we think that that is harmed by this optics of cheating.
If you get rid of the ban, then you lose out on all of these harms.
Our third argument is about quality of play.
We think that, obviously athletes play better when they're doping.
What this means is that you get more fans, because when people say are watching basketball, they want to go out and see incredible slam dunks and shots that nobody would ever have been able to make a few years ago, and the best way to ensure that that happens is to have doping, so the athletes can perform at the highest level.
And remember, it's not like athletes don't have to train in order to do well.
Doping is just a supplement to training.
So I think that you ultimately get better play, which leads to more fans.
This means more money for athletes in the league, and also that there are more fans enjoying the sport which we think is something that's intrinsically good.
So for these three reasons, we should legalize doping in sport.
Thank you."
"I'm proud to support the motion that we should ban cheerleading.
Three independent points, first is that this is a particularly dangerous sport.
So we think that especially when we're talking about something that is predominantly practiced by adolescence it's important to take into account whether or not an individual is capable of consenting into something that is so dangerous.
Recognize that children, because they are so young, don't have access to the information necessary to make an informed decision on whether or not they consent into danger.
Cheerleading itself is notably dangerous.
There is a high risk of head injuries especially from like going really high up on a pyramid and things like that.
There is also just like a lot of moving around and obviously as anyone who has seen cheerleading before can attest to, there isn't much in the way of protective gear.
It's not like you're using shoulder pads or helmets or anything like that despite the fact that you are putting yourself pretty notably in harm's way.
We think then that insofar as children are incapable of weighing those risks against whatever the perceived benefits of cheerleading are, the state should defer to the side of abolition insofar as children are incapable of meaningfully making that decision for themselves.
Our second independent point is the social effects that this has on high schools.
So we think that in a lot of high schools, cheerleading is seen as this thing that defines essentially who is like popular or who is just like worth talking to things like that.
While we think that the basis for the social structures is really ingrained in the nature of high school, we do think that cheerleading is a specifically important outlet for that problematic social structure to be reaffirmed.
This social structure is problematic insofar as it a, essentially tells individual children who don't like a specific activity that you are just innately worth less, b, it tells those children that they are not allowed to access social circles and other things that are really important to developing in early adolescence, and thirdly, it simply encourages more people to engage in the activity because of social pressures when it might not be a smart decision for them to do so.
See earlier argumentation about why this is physically dangerous.
Given all of this then, we think that even if cheerleading is just sort of a tool in the toolbox for this problematic social dynamic, we still think it is a better world when we get rid of that tool, when we get rid of that clear cut outlet for these social structures.
Our third and final independent point is regarding sexism and specifically the ways in which cheerleading reetrenches with regards to sexism we think that cheerleading is seen as obviously predominantly female sport.
This is something that you like look around high schools and this is something that women predominantly do and the reason why that is is that women are often crowded out of other athletic activities so football where a lot of cheerleading happens doesn't have a lot of women that are permitted to play and a lot of districts explicitly ban women from participating in the sport.
We think that cheerleading then perpetuates sexism in two ways or three ways.
First it establishes women as subordinate to male athletes that is that you were just supposed to stand on the sidelines, cheer for the men, and like stay out of the way.
We think that is a problematic attitude and we think that especially putting this in high schools and exposing children to it is extremely likely to reentrench these notions and society at large.
Secondly, we think is problematic because cheerleading provides an opportunity essentially for athletics coordinators at high schools to pooh pooh away complaints about how women aren't allowed to participate in sports.
They could say oh well yeah you're not allowed to play a little like whatever say like the football team but you can do cheerleading so it's not discriminatory.
We think then that getting rid of outlets that are explicitly designed to allow these faculty to have excuses not to allow women to participate in sports will then mitigate the potency of that excuse.
And thirdly we think that much in the same way that beauty pageants and things like that are used cheerleading is used as a way to perpetuate very specific beauty standards.
So the skimpy skirts are like halter tops that sort of thing are used in cheerleading and to perpetuate this notion of a objective singular type of female beauty and specifically to overly sexualize adolescents.
We think that then is problematic and we think that then justifies a ban.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban smacking.
What we mean by this is that we would ban like individual parents smacking their children as a form of punishment or repercussion.
This would include spanking but would also include any other kind of like hitting of a child on any other part of their body.
With that two main areas of clash: first on the way in which this starts cycles of abuse that are incredibly problematic and long lasting.
First, recognize that when you spank a child in response to them misbehaving you teach a child that violence is the answer to getting what you want.
It says: "" look when someone is making you unhappy, when someone is disagreeing with you, in order to make them comply you enact violence upon them. ""
This makes them infinitely more likely to be violent in everyday life because they think that it's the only way they get things done or get what they want.
I think this necessarily leads to things like bullies on the playground that, when not allowed to have the swing that they want, will shove the child off of it.
This leads to them getting into more trouble like in school and in everyday life, which reaffirms this idea that they are a bad child and someone that deserves to be punished and like reaffirms those cycles as well, which actually sets them up for more like failure into their future and more likely to get in more trouble there.
But also it means that they're more likely to act this way with their own children because all of these people model off of their parents.
We get really paradigms on how to parent in current society.
It's not something that is taught by text books or in college classes or in any kind of class.
Rather, we learn it directly from the individuals who brought us up and then enact that same thing on like the individuals that we bring up.
But if abuse is all you know, that'll be the only thing you know how to pass on.
This forces your own offspring into the same cycle that presumably you hated, which means that we never actually get an end to these kinds of cycles.
IE children of abusers abuse their own children who become the abusers in the future.
This is really problematic because we think that we need to create a world in which individuals can interact with each other and others without hurting them, and without seeing physical violence as a like proper response.
Our second independent argument is about efficacy.
Recognize that like, short and sweet, smacking doesn't work as a form of punishments.
Kids learn avoidance, like not actually the reason that it is bad.
I think the issue is that parents often use smacking as a replacement for communicating to their child what the problem is.
The problem there is that children don't learn to stop doing something by like a blanket banner, like a blanket like: "" you cannot do this "".
Rather, they're oftentimes rational creatures that want to know the rationale for a certain action, not just what the end result ought be.
The problem with smacking a child around us like a way by which you get them to comply with you is that kids start to hide their bad behavior but don't actually do it less, because they don't know the reason that they ought be doing it less.
This is bad because it means that they never unlearn, rather they just learn how to do it in a like more private setting, which doesn't actually take away from the fact that it's probably an action they shouldn't be taking in the first place.
But the second layer to this is that kids start to distrust their parents when they are afraid of being hurt by them.
This means that they won't go to them if something actually goes bad or if there is a real problem.
This is dangerous, especially as children get older and the shenanigans that they get up to get worse.
We think it's really important that individuals who get badly hurt during like bad stupid games, or individuals who like get someone pregnant or have sex without protection, are willing to reach out to their parents rather than like hidden underneath because they're afraid of being punished.
We want kids to communicate with their parents and feel comfortable.
And more than this I think it's true that children tend to generalize these responses to authority as a whole, which means the same children that got smacked around by their parents also have a hard time interacting with teachers or cops and other figures of authority.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"We should abolish the double jeopardy defense because it is affirmatively justified to ultimately achieve the purposes of justice, and secondarily, double jeopardy is unnecessary because abuses of it will be self regulating in nature given practical constraints.
So let's start by talking about why double jeopardy is affirmatively justified.
So keep in mind that the likely reason somebody is going to be having this debate and discussion in the first place of trying somebody for a crime that they were already not convicted of, is because they probably have to have some reason to do so.
We would posit that the likely reason for this is because some kind of new evidence comes up that would possibly lead to an actual substantive change in the outcome of the case itself.
So this new evidence can come in the form of say like maybe like more modern day DNA evidence, it could come in the form of a confession, or come in the form of like new witnesses that maybe were too afraid to testify beforehand.
There is any number of circumstances that are fairly plausible under which there might be different evidence that could that was concealed before the trial that could substantively change an outcome.
And this is particularly true given that in a lot of places like america, there is a right to a speedy trial.
Especially when it's a criminal trial.
Oftentimes there's not a very wide time window for a lot of evidence to come out or it could just be something that came from long time ago where some of the evidence may not have existed because of contemporary technology.
So this is important because it under any one of those cases it's possible the outcome of the court can change.
And this is key.
Because I don't think that guilt or innocence is merely something that is proven or not proven by a process.
That is to say if you actually committed a crime in reality, just because you were found not guilty of it doesn't mean that you didn't are any less guilty of the crime, if you did in reality do it, because whether or not you committed the crime is is factual in nature.
Not nearly procedural in nature.
So this is important because I think that the criminal justice system should, at its best, try to make sure that it is striving for truth and that it is striving to make sure that it's actually able to punish people who have committed crimes and wrongs.
Keep in mind that if these people, if there's more evidence that somebody committed the crime, maybe they there was like a confession or DNA evidence, and they're now walking away scot-free from that crime, this is someone who deserves to be punished, who isn't being punished.
This is someone who in which case victims have been wronged and victims aren't being compensated.
This is somebody who may be a threat to society at large and society isn't being protected from this person.
There's a lot of reasons why if somebody has is guilty and is a criminal they need to make sure that they're justice is administered to them.
So finally let's talk about why I think that at the end the day this is self regulating and isn't actually going to be abused all that much.
Keep in mind that it costs a whole lot of money to put on trials.
Whether if you're a if you're like a state, you don't want to just like this is why a lot of trials are settled with plea agreements or settlements or things like that.
People don't want to go to trial because going to trial is risky, it's expensive and it's a arduous process.
So I think that when you're giving somebody the option of trying someone again for a crime they were already not found they were found not guilty of it's likely that most rational people will look at this as a waste of money.
So they're probably not just going to do this to harass people as a way to keep people in jail indefinitely or try to indefinitely detain somebody without actually proving charges against them.
I would first and foremost likely say that if these abuses were occurring, they would be found unconstitutional and therefore they would get kicked out.
But I also think that this is just an unlikely thing actually happen in reality.
So what you're left with is double jeopardy only being used when there's actually a substantively likely change in the outcome of the case one way or another.
So for those reasons very proud to propose."
"We should legalize insider trading.
In this debate, we're going to present two main arguments.
The first is about increased market efficiency and the second is about the problem with enforcement.
So, on the first point: we think that what insider trading actually does it is that it informs other traders, as well as the market, via action.
If you're an actor that has inside information that a company is failing or that a company is doing successful, that is information that certain people will not have and therefore, you have a a bulk amount of traders.
The market itself is a collective, is less informed about what they are putting their money into, and this thing is set in stone.
Like the amount of revenue that you're generating in a quarter is set in stone prior to that q one report coming out and allowing traders to become informed traders.
But what actually happens is that people are still trading on misinformation and if an insider trader or a group of insider traders is able to go in and change those market forces to show that there is a significant dropoff in asset value or is there there's a large group buying up these assets, that makes the market more informed.
It means that even though these quarterly reports can come out immediately once information is known, and even though people are still going to trade, there's a way for people to get a better understanding and you, as an insider trader, create a more informed market.
The other thing that it ends up doing and this isn't this isn't in in turn creates a system in which stock more accurately and appropriately reflects the value of a company, which means that, again, traders have more understanding and the value is more reflective of that system.
But additionally, we also think that it creates a system in which you even out market volatility.
And what this means is that if you have a system in which bad information comes out, say, a company's quarterly earnings are fifty percent less than what they were expected to be and therefore, there's likely to be a run on that company's stock in which a whole bunch of people are going to try and sell and that company is going to collapse, or if there are long-term market forces at play, such as large banks that are corporations, companies such as banks, that give out loans that are central to institutions that could impact stocks more broadly.
If this information through insider trading is allowed to be if insider traders are allowed to act, this means that you smooth out market volatility.
It means that not all actors are having this run on stocks immediately and therefore, instead of getting a market crash, you get a long-term market downward trend in which people are not being forced out of their homes, in which the type of volatility associated with a stock market crash doesn't come into play, in which the government has more time to accurately prepare for this type of downturn and has more time to create kind of barriers and safety nets for people that may be affected by this crisis.
So on enforcement, recognize that SEC enforcement of these types of actions is widely disparate and often only impacts small or smaller traders, so like corporate ceos and c-level executives don't get prosecuted at at the same rate as lower-level employees.
And what's also important to recognize is that these laws are incredibly vague.
So it's very difficult to determine whether or not proprietary research falls under insider trading, and what is designated as insider information and proprietary information, and what is legitimate to trade on.
So, oftentimes, people don't even know that what they're doing is insider trading and yet, because these people are the least informed and often the lowest down on the ladder, these are the people that end up being prosecuted.
If you can't prosecute in a fair manner, if you can't have a system of laws in which you can ensure accountability across classes and across levels of responsibility in hierarchies, we don't think that these are laws that are meaningful.
We don't think that these are laws that are fair, and given that the market benefits of insider trading are actually greater than the detriments and that this is, on net, a victimless crime, we should legalize insider trading."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion, that we should abolish zoos.
Two independent points: first, animal rights, and second, poor resource use.
On the first point, of animal rights.
First animal rights exist, right?
Like, they experience pain and pleasure, and at the most fundamental level, that's, I think, where we derive whether or not something has moral worth.
Whether or not it is capable of saying: x is bad, and y is good.
Why is the truth, then?
I think, generally, these other standards, like whether or not they are self aware, or they're sentient, or intelligent, or things like that, are at best inappropriately or inconsistently applied.
For example, we allow really unintelligent people to have rights.
I just don't think that, generally speaking, this argument is applied in such a way that's like: oh well, like, really unintelligent people have less rights than really intelligent people.
Like, generally speaking, I think the way that we just understand, whether or not something should have rights should just be, like, can it experience pain, and if so it's probably a good idea to minimize the amount of pain, that the thing experiences.
So, what exactly is the pain, then, that animals have to experience, that's intrinsic to zoos?
Lots of things really.
So, cages are a good example, like even if they're not literally kept to the cage, they're kept in a amount of space, restricted from what they're, generally like, their natural habitat would be, that has like a lot of pretty profound impacts on the animal.
It can induce depression, it can make them feel anxious, it can even make them like incapable of like living properly, like they just need a certain amount of space to be able to stay active, and run around, and like maintain their muscular strength, things like that.
Second, there's a lot of fear intrinsic to being stared at all day by humans, and like people tapping on glass, and things like that.
Like generally animals don't interpret these, like, thousands of humans looking at them on a daily basis as friends.
Generally animals see these as threats, like, these like thousands and thousands of moving things, that are lurking at the edge of your habitat all the time.
I think, generally speaking, that creates like a pretty substantial amount of fear in the animal, that is you know leaves something to be desired.
And third is underfeeding, like zoos, at the end of the day, are like these really profit oriented entities.
They basically sit down, they crunch the numbers, and they're like: okay, what can we afford to feed the animals these days?
Because generally speaking, animals like to eat a lot, when they're in the wild.
If they have like a surplus, they'll take that opportunity.
The problem is that zoos never really have an incentive to give them a surplus, and that really bad, right?
Like the financial incentive is just to give them whatever the bare minimum is, to ensure that they can keep being cute, and that the humans will show up to look at them.
So I think, generally speaking, these animals go through a lot of abuses, and a lot of pain when they're in zoos, and that intrinsically is something that we should avoid, because the animals have an affirmative right to not experience pain.
And on the second point, that it's a poor use of resources.
Zoos take up a lot of land, and they take up a lot of water, like, filling the pools, giving water to the animals, that sort of thing.
The problem is that they're generally in the middle of cities, and land shortages, in cities these days, are a serious issue.
They drive up housing prices, they drive down the number of amenities that a city can have, you know like, that's less green space, even in the best interpretation, but when it's less housing, like that creates a serious issue for people.
That means that housing prices go up, that means there's more people who are homeless, or there's just less people they can live in the city, which even then, means that wages go down, because there's less labor that's actually feasible within the cities, so that companies leave, like, there's a lot of externalities that are generated, by the lack of adequate space in a city, and we think zoos are just a poor use of that space, given they generate active harm anyway.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should subsidize renewable energy.
By we, we mean the united states, by subsidies, we refer to subsidies on green technology and renewable technology as well as tax breaks for corporations that are created to either propagate the use of renewable energy or have like some kind of tech development tied up in it.
Like basically any kind of subsidy or like money given that is supposed to increase access to renewable energy or facilitate it would be something we're comfortable defending.
Three main areas of clash: first, on achieving energy independence.
Recognize that there's a problem in the status quo where we spend where we depend on middle eastern countries or russia to provide oil that literally runs our country.
Like the dependence that every WLD has on the existence of oil and gas is massive insofar as we use it from everything from heating our homes to running our cars, like we literally would not be able to function as a society without it.
But it's really bad that we rely on the specific countries because it ties our economy and social functioning to the countries that don't really like us that much.
Like if they want to mess us up or cause any kind of discomfort, all they have to do is cut us off from oil.
And we saw this happen multiple times, but I think a really good example was in nineteen seventy three when carter issued some kind of doctrine helping israel and suddenly, oil prices skyrocketed because saudi arabia had decided that they were no longer going to give us any.
We had cars standing in the streets.
They had to enforce allocation amounts that were unfeasible for individuals who had gotten used to a very different way of living, and very different commutes, and it was both bad on a social and economic level insofar as economically it was very difficult to like deal with this expensive oil and be able to still provide and like still have money for other things, but socially, because it showed us as weak to the american people and prevented people from being able to live their everyday lives or exist as functioning members of society.
And we think this is like preferably not something we want, right?
But there's also a second layer here.
We think that you can't check against the abuses of these kinds of countries when you depend on them for oil, because you're always afraid of them taking it away.
I think a really good example of this is how saudi arabia is incredibly oppressive to women and practices a lot of like problematic things legally, etcetera, but we can never sanction them because if we did, we'd lose our oil and therefore our livelihood.
So it like forces the united states in situations where they have to weigh our economic solvency above necessarily the human rights abuses happening.
But this doesn't happen when we subsidize renewable energy, because it's something that we control and can sell technology to other countries.
So, we actually think that you get like a more effective policer of human rights abuses on our side of the house, when we can freely sanction other countries because there aren't any like harmful outcomes regarding oil.
Our second area of clash is about the necessity of doing this in order to do like stop global warming, etcetera.
Like recognize that global warming is really bad insofar as this floods coastlines, destroys cities and villages, allows diseases to spread, and kills crops as well as a slew of other impacts.
So it's important to stop the spread of global warming in order to stop these harms.
And so we think that it's actually really important when we take action against potential like take action towards renewable energy that would be less wasteful than like the greenhouse gases produced when you burn oil.
But also recognize that we're just running out of oil, right?
Like recognize that insofar as there's a limited supply and it takes millions of years to develop in the ground, there is no alternative for us but to find out a way to maximize our use of renewable energy, because otherwise we're just simply going to run out, and it's going to lead to all kinds of governmental instability and economic damages.
So we think that the US just needs to get on top of their shit and just go and subsidize this already, because otherwise we're going to push this to the last minute.
Like the oil the oil oligarchs are going to hold onto their power for as long as possible, and so we need this market incentive to spur the entire industry forward.
Like currently, oil has been normalized, and it's cheaper to use it.
Corporations don't invest and don't innovate because they see any other energy source as risky.
But now, if you get over that initial cost, then it's going to be cheaper into the long term and less risky because the initial infrastructure will be in place.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should ban whaling.
So I want to be clear what we're talking about: we support a total worldwide ban on hunting and killing whales for any reason.
So with that in mind we have two large arguments.
The first is about ecological considerations surrounding whaling.
I think that it's important to understand that some species are more important to their environments than others.
These species are called keystone species and most often they are the ones that other species depend upon the most.
If you have a large predator, for instance, that consumes huge amounts of biomass and keeps other species population in check, then that's really essential to be sure that those species don't get out of control and ultimately decimate the ecosystem.
This is the case with most whales.
They are the largest predator in their ecosystem and it's true that they consume things like krill that you or I may not think of as a large species but ultimately in the kind of environments that most whales live in, namely the arctic, these are extremely fragile environments where the whale is the keystone species because they keep the populations of other species in check and at very little risk of high population growth themselves.
But we also have another ecological benefit which is a bit more humane which is that they're very charismatic mega fauna, is what people call them.
Basically what that means is that little boys and girls around the world love whales.
So they care about the environment because of whales.
People don't care that much about some arctic shrimp going extinct even though it may be a problem for the environment.
What they care a lot about is a great big graceful beautiful creature that is potentially at risk.
This means that the whales mean that people are more likely to care about the environment as a whole because they care about one part of the environment.
But if whales are hunted to extinction then you lose out on that and these arctic ecosystems lose out on one of the strongest guarantees of their continued existence, namely human investment in their well being, in the form of human concern for wales.
So we think that in the long term these environments are much more at risk because of the loss of a keystone species and because people won't care as much about them.
And I guess obviously we're concerned about unforeseen harms.
I mentioned before that you might see runaway population growth through the shrimp and krill that whale eat but who can say that there won't be other side effects as well that no one can predict right now because we have imperfect information?
We just don't think that you should make an irreversible decision like letting whales be hunted possibly to extinction in order to er when you don't have all the good information.
Now I bet the other team is going to get up here and say that they can hunt whales responsibly but we just don't think that's true.
We think that there is a sort of tragedy of the commons with the open ocean where every single country wants to take as much as they can and give us as little back and that means that every country will always regulate themselves favorably and ignore any international treaty that doesn't suit themselves about whales, like japan is doing, in the status quo when they systematically ignore regulations about whaling.
So our second argument then is about the providence of nature.
So we think that future people, first of all, have an equal claim to current people to the beauty and goodness of nature.
In other words we need to leave the environment the way we found it or better so that future people can enjoy the beauty of nature and the resources of nature.
And if we consume them all now they will never come back and we are basically robbing our grandchildren of these incredible creatures and the environments where they live.
But aside from that, we'd like to point out that whales tend to live in international waters and that no one country should be able to get rich at the expense of every other country by destroying a valuable resource like the whales.
And lastly I'd just like to point out that biological diversity is irreplaceable.
Once species go extinct obviously they are never coming back and who can say what uses those species might have to humankind in the future?
In terms of research or unforeseen potential benefits to our species.
So we see that for instance if people twenty thousand years ago had hunted horses to extinction the course of human history would have been much impoverished.
I'm not saying that whales are the next horse, I am merely saying that they could have unforeseen benefits to us that we couldn't even begin to imagine right now.
So for these reasons we should ban whaling.
Thank you"
"Blood donation should be mandatory.
On our side, we're arguing that people who are safely able to give blood, such as healthy adults and people who don't have any transmissible disease, should be required to donate blood if there is a shortage of blood in your country.
So we're not saying that everyone is going to have to go in every monday morning and donate a pint of blood but, for instance, after a natural disaster, when there is a huge demand for blood donations, we would be okay with requiring healthy people to donate.
A good example of this might be after the terrible hurricane that hit puerto rico last year.
We would be fine with requiring healthy puerto ricans to donate blood, if they're able, so that we have enough blood to supply all of the people in need after that terrible disaster.
With that in mind, we have two main arguments: the first is that from a utilitarian perspective, this is obviously ethical, and the second is about how this ends shortages.
So what do we mean about why this is ethical?
We would tell you that when you're making a decision about whether something is the right thing to do, you need to weigh the costs to different groups of people.
We would say that the harm to someone of not getting blood when they need it is so great that we're willing to ignore people's right to choose how to use their body in order to prevent that from happening.
We're not going to deny that this is an imposition on personal freedom, rather we're going to say that if you compare the enormous harm of someone who has a rare blood type or who just needs blood in general not being able to get that transfusion versus the relatively minor cost of having to give up a pint of blood and maybe drink a little bit of extra water that day, it's clear that we should defer to the person whose life is at risk rather than the healthy person, whose time is at risk.
Now, they other side might see that some people have religious objections or that some people are just very uncomfortable with needles but, again, I think it's clear that saving people's lives, especially in a time of extreme need, is much more important than any other freedom.
After all, the right to life must precede any other rights that people have.
You would have no way to access your right to freedom of religion or bodily autonomy if you aren't alive.
So we think that this is the most basic right that governments need to preserve.
And if there is a demand that isn't being met, we think that it's necessary for the government to step in and correct this failing of the market by requiring that people donate.
Our second argument is about how this uniquely ends shortages.
Blood donation tends to be something that people do a few times a year when their office or their school has a blood drive.
Many times this happens around the holidays.
The problem with that is that blood, apparently, doesn't remain stable very long.
You have to constantly be replenishing the supply of blood available to hospitals in your country.
In a huge country like the united states, this might be something that people can do easily, but in a relatively small country like, say, switzerland, there might be many fewer people donating at any given time so that, if god forbid, there should be a disaster, there wouldn't be enough blood on hand, even if people were donating a little bit throughout the year.
The only way to deal with this sudden demand is to have a sudden increase in supply as well.
And while it's true that many generous people might go out and donate blood of their own volition, what we're talking about is what happens when people aren't donating enough blood.
After all, if there was no need for this, it wouldn't be implemented.
So we think that given that there's this sudden surge of demand, the only way to end the shortage is going to be to require people to donate.
The other side might say you could import blood from other countries, but that probably isn't an option for many poorer countries and, also, sometimes isn't practical, because you have immediate need.
On our side, we've explained to you why this is ethical, why it's necessary and, also, how we uniquely stop shortages in the blood supply when it's most needed.
For all these reasons, blood donation should be mandatory.
Thank you."
"We should end progressive taxation.
So progressive taxation is, generally speaking, a tax on income wherein people who earn more money will pay a higher rate of tax.
The way that this works in the US, and I believe many other countries, is that the first six thousand dollars you make is tax free, the next six thousand dollars you make is taxed at a fairly low rate like five percent, and then as you make more and more money, the money earned above a certain amount is taxed at a higher rate.
So even if you make a hundred thousand dollars a year, the first six thousand dollars is untaxed, for instance.
You can think of it as a sort of series of buckets where as money overflows from one bucket into another, you have a higher rate of taxation.
This is in place in most US states and in most countries around the world.
Our first argument against progressive taxation is that it is unfair and arbitrary.
People who are very wealthy benefit the same amount from public services as people who are not very wealthy.
At that point we don't think they should have to pay more money in than anyone else.
For instance, everyone benefits from having streets and police officers, yet the poor drive on the same streets as the rich.
Why should the rich therefore pay a much greater percentage of their income than the poor?
We think that this burden falls unfairly on those groups.
The other team is going to get up here and tell you that the marginal value of a dollar is much higher for a poor person than a rich person.
But at that point we tell you, that it's not up to the state to determine the marginal value of a dollar to any individual citizen, that people know their own interests better than the government knows them and that we ought defer to people's knowledge of themselves rather than the state's ideas about how much money is worth to them.
We also think that the income brackets are completely arbitrary.
In the united states for instance we've often seen politician shuffle around income brackets, change who pays how much, raise taxes on the middle, lower, or upper classes in order to suit their voting bases.
This effectively just becomes a form of cronyism where people vote in groups that will lower their tax bracket and raise the amount of tax that other people pay.
We think that a flat tax would ultimately be less corrupt and less arbitrary.
Our second argument is that this creates needlessly complicated tax codes.
Right now in the united states as I mentioned earlier, the brackets themselves are fairly complicated.
But on top of that, in order to avoid paying higher rates of tax, people will go to extreme lengths to actually put themselves into certain tax brackets.
This might mean investing in fake investment vehicles or just refusing income because people don't want to pay tax at a higher rate.
There are lots of perverse incentives against people actually being productive, which is in the end, what's best for the economy.
So we think that this is an unnecessarily complex tax code that hurts the economy.
But it also provokes lots of tax evasion because it's so complicated.
We think that if you want to actually collect more tax, you should make it harder for people to evade their tax burden and that a flat tax would be simpler and easier to detect fraud.
Our third argument is that ultimately, a progressive income tax actually ignores people's ability to pay.
Why is this true?
Wealth is not taxed progressively if it's taxed at all.
Sure many areas have property taxes but these are almost always flat.
We tell you that ultimately wealth is a more important factor than income.
Someone could be a doctor or name lots and lots of income but have no personal wealth because they have lots of debt from medical school.
While the child of some millionaire might have very little income but have very valuable property.
We tell you that at that point, the person with the greater ability to pay and contribute to society is the person with lots of property not the person with lots of debt and that at that point, because progressive income taxes ignore the burden that people have in the form of debt, or ignore mitigating factors with regard to their income, that ultimately they're unfair.
We should therefore end progressive taxation.
Thank you."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should prohibit tower blocks.
Three independent points: first, is problems associated with density.
So there's a lot of externalities that are generated when you have a large amount of people living in a small amount of space.
This is intrinsic to tower blocks.
You stack a bunch of people on top of each other and suddenly in this very small place of land you have a large amount of people because you've built it all vertically.
Externalities include things like increased smog from just the general amount of machinery associated with human activity that is occurring in the location, increased traffic based again on human volume, increased noise and light pollution, increased costs of goods in land, this is driven by and this is really the most significant one, is that it is driven by the fact that there is a large amount of people competing for a small amount of space.
That increases the cost of real estate which in turn increases the costs of goods.
Your supermarket is going to be much more expensive when their rent is through the roof because of the value that is associated with the land.
We think generally speaking then people's quality of life is going to be a lot better when they could spread out a bit more.
The land value goes down and the cost of living in turn also goes down.
Our seconded independent point is ghost powers.
So when you build these like high rise luxury condominium type buildings you generally have a lot of property costs that go up because they are seen as a signal that the market in the area is hot.
That would normally be fine if people were buying in the area.
It would drive a lot of like tax revenue and things like that.
But the problem is that you generally just put a big sticker price on the individual condominiums inside the building and then what happens is that foreign investors but it up.
So I think like a really notorious example of this is the millennium tower in boston where the the like top like entire like few floors are just like empty because people buy these up as investments so that they could resell them later.
There's also a lot of cities in china where this is like a notorious thing where there's just these huge, huge rising towers that nobody lives in because it's basically treated like stocks.
Like it's just an investment that people hold onto so they can sell later.
That's a problem because the property area values in the area now increase but without the reciprocal benefit of people walking these streets, buying goods from the stores, things like that.
So we think that you get a lot of the harms without the benefits.
Our third independent point is that it drives segregation.
This I think is probably what's most important.
So when you have these large tower blocks that increase density in generally the center of a city it creates a congregation of wealthy people at the center of the city in a very small space.
This is a problem because now what you have in your city, instead of just sort of like a mixed income neighborhood at the center where you have like the inner city sort of jostling up upon the people that just want to live close to where they work, by like you know the office buildings and things like that at the center of the city, now what you have is a lot of very valuable real estate right at that center of the city that a lot of people compile into.
That then pushes lower income people out of those neighborhoods and into a center ring.
So basically the way your city looks now is you have a dense population at the very center, then a ring of poor neglected neighborhoods, and then another ring of suburbs that are much wealthier.
So you have like when your transit system does this you literally have people riding the train through the poorer neighborhoods in a way that allows the city at the most at a basic infrastructure level to neglect these neighborhoods.
Because they only have to worry now about the center and the outer ring.
They don't have to prioritize those central neighborhoods and we think this is problematic for these neighborhoods capacity to have services provided to them.
Proud to propose."
"The freedom of speech is not absolute.
So to clarify, when you say that a right is absolute, or freedom is absolute, we would say that that means that there's no instance in which that right can be restricted.
So, you can't repeal the ability for people to have free speech, to say that speech, and we think, in the instance of freedom of speech, it's not simply sufficient to say that, people can say things in the privacy of their own home, but rather freedom of speech, in a robust sense, would require the freedom to speak in a certain way, or to say certain things in public, and then absolute freedom of speech will require an absolute freedom to say whatever you want in public.
Okay, so first, we're going to talk about the nature of rights themselves, and secondly we're going to talk about why, based on that, this right cannot be absolute.
We would say that, rights only matter insofar as they are utile.
So, while people would say that utility is distinct from rights, we would say that, if you ask why a right is important, if you question that for the basis of any right, it essentially boils down, not to the ability for people to have these rights, but the ability for people to gain things from these rights.
The freedom of speech isn't important, if people aren't able to gain anything from it.
So, we think that utility is directly linked to the ability for rights to be meaningful, and furthermore, we don't think that rights arise from nature.
So, we don't think that I am naturally given with a right to freely speak whatever I want, or any other type of right.
Rights only can be enforced within a social structure, and they're clearly created within that social structure as well, whether that comes, and how we construct our constitutions, or our legal systems, or what we allow generally within our social systems.
Given that this is the case, we think that speech has external ramifications, that should be checked, even if this means having a high bar.
So, when we say that the freedom of speech is not absolute, this doesn't mean that we don't think that there should be a high bar for checking speech, or that political desires to check on speech are probably not justifications, that are reasonable, to actually restrict speech, because someone is speaking against you politically, but we would say that, there are instances in which the speech has negative external harms, and have no clear gains as far as utility.
Okay, this is also important, because even if you do restrict the freedoms of speech, it doesn't restrict the ability to say things, like in your private life, it doesn't restrict the ability for people to critically think about things, so even if you're restricting someone's ability to stand up on a podium and spew what they want to spew, this doesn't necessarily mean that you're restricting their personhood in a meaningful way.
So, this isn't even a lower bar that you we think you need to hit.
Okay, two examples of why we should restrict speech, the first is hate speech.
We think in instances of hate speech, the speech only exists to create terror, and in a group, often a minority, or otherwise depressed group, and that when this happens, there's no clear gain, and no utility to society, because it only exists to marginalize that group, and, in a sense, to restrict their freedom of speech.
When people do not feel comfortable with in their environment, when people are exposed to hate speech, that marginalizes those groups even further, and discredits their ideas, and discredits their ability to participate in our political and social discourse.
We think that, when you marginalize the voices of others through your own speech, and that given that the speech of something, even if it's repugnant, it something that you can hold in your mind without speaking it, and therefore you can internalize the benefits of your belief, however you choose to do so, given that you marginalize other people's freedom of speech by doing this, we think that you should check it, in this instance, to maximize the freedom of others.
Another instance is in lies and asymmetry of information.
So for example, an absolute freedom of speech would allow an advertiser to go out, and lie blatantly about an object, because their lying is a form of their speech, and you could say a form of their expression, or their opinion, and they're, if an absolute freedom of speech exists, are totally in their right to do this type of thing, to lie blatantly.
We simply think that, that's not fair, we think the government and our social structures exist to correct for asymmetries of information, because the average person simply doesn't have the ability to be informed, in robust way, about a round list of topics, in the same way that a government is capable of doing, and that we have a government in order to gather this information, and to make informed decisions for us, when we don't have the information necessary.
So given that, these types of asymmetry of information could be easily exploited, in economic or in economic ways or otherwise, that in these instances, it's crucial that you check the freedom of speech, the freedom of speech, in the sense to be able to lie.
So clearly, even if there are there are many more instances, in which this may be appropriate to restrict freedom of speech, given that we can identify two, that is enough to show that the freedom of speech is not absolute."
"We should abolish capital punishment because it's a barbaric way of punishing people.
It's irreversible, which is bad if you wrongfully convict somebody.
It deters nothing, and it's really expensive and an inefficient way to punish somebody.
So, let's start by talking about why it's just a barbaric and inhumane way of punishing people.
And I think that this starts from the basic premise that no matter who's doing the murdering, murder is immoral, human life has some kind of value to it and that we should be focusing on rehabilitation and second chances in almost all circumstances and , at the very least, we shouldn't be proliferating murder in any kind of way.
And I think, in the most basic sense, this just comes from the like the idea that human life has some kind of value and that there is nothing that somebody can do that is just so absolutely horrible that they just simply do not have any kind of claim to life anymore and that there's always a way in which like you can try to like work with people, try to help people, rehabilitate people, or give people second chances.
There is all kinds of people throughout like history who have done horrible things and, sure, in a lot of cases, you can't really do all that much to rehabilitate those people, then I guess you're going to throw those people in prison for the rest of their lives, but a whole lot of people change over time.
People oftentimes do change over time.
Like you ask any person if they're the same person now as they were five years ago or ten years ago or twenty years ago, you're probably going to have most of those people say, "" no, "" and that's because people do change over time.
And I feel like just the murdering of somebody for something that they did at one point in their life just seems like an inherently unfair and immoral thing to do, because their life has value and that they always can become a different person, a better person, at some point in their life.
But beyond that, I also think that there is this is obviously horrible if you wrongfully convict somebody, because then you're literally murdering an innocent person.
And this is horribly uncommon.
Like, in places like america, there's entire organizations, like the innocence project, that are that are solely devoted to getting wrongfully convicted people off of death row because it's such a commonplace thing.
Whether it's because of rampant eyewitness misidentification because people are, well, oftentimes people are really bad at being eyewitnesses, especially for people of different races, people oftentimes can't tell the difference between black people like different features and things like that.
People are oftentimes difficult at judging features, especially at night, especially under duress.
Oftentimes DNA , even like they're not not just DNA, but oftentimes forensic testing can be inexact or flawed, fingerprints can be partial matches at best and sometimes can have like like wide error margins, most arson sciences or like ballistic sciences on guns are just junk sciences.
Oftentimes people wrongfully confess because they're under pressure, because they're being overcharged with something, because they don't think that they'll get a fair trial because juries are oftentimes racists or willing to convict people, because prosecutors are more willing to make sure they convict somebody, anyone, than risk a case going cold and their reputations being on the line.
There's tons and tons of ways in which wrongful convictions happen, which is why you get so many people that are exonerated that were on death row, and that's why the innocence project has been doing its work for such a long time, and it's going to keep being able to do its work for such a long time.
Additionally it doesn't it doesn't really deter anything.
A lifelong prison sentence is a pretty horrible thing and certainly a good deterrent for most people.
And when you're talking about murderers, when you're talking about possibly terrorists, when you're talking about drug kingpins, you're talking about people who are probably already at peace with the fact that in their line of work, they may die.
I feel like these are people who are uniquely at peace with their own mortality and probably aren't going to be deterred by the fact that the state might execute them.
So for all of those reasons, we should abolish capital punishment."
"We should ban anonymous posts.
So what we're arguing is that websites like reddit or four chan should not allow people to post anonymously, they should require them to log in with their real name.
We would be fine with using something like facebook as a way to authenticate people's identity or even having some sort of government issued identity which people will be required to use when they post online.
Three arguments for our side: the first is about tracking crime.
Imagine how much more difficult it would be to distribute illegal materials if everything you posted online were directly linked to your name.
If I had to go and post james l.
Next every pirated movie I've ever watched, then it's probably much less likely that I'd be willing to engage in that behavior.
And pirated movies are honestly the least of our concerns on the internet.
When there are people out there distributing indecent photos of minors or drug paraphernalia or lots of other things that they couldn't distribute in person, we think that ultimately it's very difficult to track and limit if their distribution is anonymous.
If everyone had to use their real name and if there were no way to get around this, then ultimately we think it would be easier for law enforcement to go after these people.
I think that in particular, for indecent material concerning children, this is just so outrageous that it's been allowed to go on in the name of allowing anonymity.
It's essential that government step in to do something in order to protect children who are being harmed and in order to go after the people who are creating and distributing this heinous material.
We think that that, in and of itself, is enough to ban these anonymous posts.
Our second argument is about self censorship.
You may have asked yourself, if you ever read the comments on youtube, why are people so much more horrible on the internet than they are in person?
People who would never dream of using racial slurs or sexist language on the metro are perfectly happy using it on youtube or on other anonymous posting services.
We think that people are encouraged to self censor when they use their own name.
Why?
Your reputation and your standing in the community is tied to your language, is tied to do with you treat other people.
But if the community, so called community, is made up of anonymous posters, then you have nothing to lose by being an absolutely atrocious human being.
You can say anything you want and do anything you want and get away with it, and no one will think that you're being inappropriate, and no one will judge you for that behavior.
So ultimately if people's real name were tied to their post, we think it's much more likely that they would behave civilly.
And we see that this happens in person.
People are generally much more affable and pleasant in person than they are online.
This could be because of the reputation or also because when other posters have a photo of themselves have their real name you're more likely to remember that there are people too and that they deserve your respect.
Just like when you interact with another human being, you aren't just polite to them because you don't want to look like a jerk, but also because you care about them as another human being.
We think that tying into this empathy and also to this shame would ultimately reduce the amount of hate speech, reduce the amount of racism, reduce the amount of awfulness on the internet in general, that this would make the internet a more accessible place for people of different backgrounds and that ultimately this would also be enough to justify requiring people to post with their name rather than anonymously.
Our final argument might seem a bit perverse at first, but it's about preventing doxing doxing is when an otherwise anonymous community publishes the name and real world information about an individual in that community.
Presumably the reason there's a threat here, is because there's an imbalance now.
One person is a known quantity the other people remain anonymous.
If everyone were a known quantity then there wouldn't be any benefit to doxing people.
We think that this would prevent hate groups from using this as a tool to intimidate people and prevent them from speaking on line, which is something that we see groups like anonymous do right now.
For all of these reasons we believe therefore that you should ban anonymous posts.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban algorithmic trading.
What we mean by this is that we would no longer allow for companies or hedge funds or mutual funds, to use, or any kind of personal portfolio, to use algorithms that would say sell when the stock drops by ex percentage, or anything similar, to sell off large amounts of stock or manage each other's stock.
Instead we would prefer for it to be done basically the way that we've done that up to this point, in which individual people decide when to sell stock based on trends that they interpret personally.
Two main areas of clash: the first on the way in which algorithmic treating is prone to bugs and the impacts thereof.
So here's a couple of examples: commonly in algorithmic trading you're taking an integer and your rounding it to a decimal.
What happens then?
Or you end up in situations where you have a negative interest rate, or maybe you just program something incorrectly, or maybe you just didn't test every kind of edge case, such as the situation in japan, where we all were like "" oh, they're never going to put in place negative interest rates "", but joke's on you, that's exactly what they did.
But since the algorithms never actually accounted for a moment in which negative interest rates would exist, there was no way for them to operate in that world and the ended up being completely wild.
So we think that when these kinds of issues arise, and we think they're fairly common, it's the consumer first who owns that portfolio who gets kind of stuck and gets in trouble because of it.
Because suddenly they are probably down large amounts of stock at little profit to like massive losses, and now this money that they put into it has essentially been wasted.
But there's also this like larger impact in terms of big companies.
Because recognize that when you're selling off tons and tons of stock at a time, what you're messing with is that is is the future of these companies and what they own.
So like when people have pension pension funds that are bundled by large corporations, they lose them because those corporations fail.
Or when you end up with like very large amounts of stock being sold off and it leads to shifts in the market, what happens then is that you scare investors away and they start pulling out.
Because they're seeing that: "" look the market is incredibly unstable.
We don't know what's going to happen next. ""
And so rather than risking keeping their money in those areas, they start pulling it all out while they can still end up ahead.
This is incredibly problematic insofar as it crashes companies.
Because suddenly they don't have any of the stock left or not enough that is like actually bought.
It makes their stock very very cheap when it's flooding the market, because everyone is selling it off.
And this can also affect banks because a lot of banks are actually investing the money.
And so we saw this happen in the great depression, when consumers got really really nervous and started pulling all their money out of banks, and that banks just didn't have all of that money.
Because so much of it was invested.
And what this essentially creating is a world in which governments have to try and bail this out.
Unfortunately governments don't always have that money, and so we think that this is a world we ought not be risking.
Our second independent point has to do with volatility.
So a lot of, so let's like bring up another example: you have lots of companies that use the same general algorithm for when they sell their stock.
AKA when the when the stock falls by ex percentage, that's when you sell.
So one company has it at two percent another has it at three percent, so on and so forth.
So the first company with the lowest barrier to sell sells it all off as soon as it hits below that barrier, because that's what the algorithm is programmed to do.
This triggers the next one because when you sell a lot of stock you drop the price further, which would activate the next barrier.
And as well as like leading to the flight response in which investors see this trend and say: "" oh no.
Like even if you're not using an algorithm you can't leave it there. ""
This cycle continues and essentially you end up destroying companies because the stock value becomes zero as more and more floods the market.
This also has a more pernicious effect, because if the first mover is the one who wins the above described cycle, than everyone wants to be that first mover.
It means you're going to have more and more algorithms that are setting you lower and lower barrier to sell, leading to an endless cycle in which there is never a stable company to invest in.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should abolish marriage.
Three independent points.
First is that the government shouldn't be in the business of defining what marriage is.
Under our model we would say that marriage is something that can happen between individuals on a private basis but we wouldn't say that the government you know should actually in put their stamp of approval on this, that they should actually you know issue marriage licenses and define what constitutes marriage.
And the reason why we're specifically uncomfortable with government defining what constitutes marriage is that it means that social that rights for you know groups that often don't have access to marriage that people like gay people for example or polyamorous relationships.
These are people who don't have access to the right to marriage until social tolerance catches up with a you know what they want to do essentially.
So this means you have a lot of rights infringements over the broad history of most countries.
We think that it shouldn't be contingent upon you know what the social attitudes at the time are, but rather that this is a private decision that people can make themselves without the government stamp of approval and as a result society at large shouldn't have to engage in the litmus test for whether or not you have that right.
But furthermore we think the government shouldn't be involved in such a private affair, that this is something that happens between two individuals and it's really not anybody else's business.
Someone else's marriage doesn't affect me as an individual so my elected officials shouldn't have a right then to have any sort of say in what constitutes a marriage between those two individuals.
Our second independent point is the formalization makes leaving tougher.
That is that marriage is a social construct at the end of the day, this is just sort of like the notion largely propagated by religious institutions that two people are joining together in matrimony indefinitely.
The problem is that people don't generally do that people, leave quite often divorce rates are actually quite high.
And this is a problem because when marriages formalize through a government institution there are lots of legal barriers to exiting that marriage.
This is an issue because it means that you know people that want a divorce for perfectly reasonable reasons that don't quite fall within the government's definition of what constitutes grounds for divorce can have a lot of difficulty with it.
Furthermore those legal barriers and the legalistic ways in which we approach marriage create lots of hazy lines around ownership of property and things like that.
We think rather than you know having all these like silly loopholes and regulations around marriage we should just allow individuals to craft their own agreements, make their own individual decisions, and not have the government you know make these decisions for them in ways that are often harmful in the long term.
Our third independent point is that marriage as an institution is just a bad thing and we really shouldn't be encouraging it.
So first off I do want to establish that when the government gives their stamp of approval that normalizes the notion that marriage is something that like you know is a good basically a social good that you are saying you know we issue these licenses, we decide what marriage is therefore it's probably a good thing.
The problem is that it's probably not.
Marriage when it's so widespread maximizes the notion that you people should be cohabitant, that it is you know the normal thing to do to get married.
But we don't think this is necessarily true, both because we think that there are lots of different interpretations of marriage, different ways you could go about it that are equally legitimate but secondly because we don't think that people should even have to be married in the first place, that it's bad when that's a social norm and the people are shamed for not getting married.
Given that we think the government involvement in this you know private decision and in this like larger social construct just is harmful in that it perpetuates the notion that there is a rigid definition of marriage, that there is a rigid construct of what constitutes it and what people ought do with their lives.
Proud to propose."
"We should further exploit aquaculture.
What we mean by this is basically just that we think it would be a better world in which we focused more on aquaculture and moved away from things like commercial fishing and even used it perhaps to substitute forms of hunting.
Like we just think that this is something that ought to be used a lot more in our society.
Two main arguments, first on why it's good for society.
Under this first is that it is physically healthier.
Recognize that vitamins found in fish we don't often get in many other places.
This is everything from like literal fish oil that people often resort to drinking and it's disgusting or to the vitamins of, but a lot of people don't have access to those or don't realize they should be taking them.
So it's not reliable for individuals to get this as a regular vitamin or a regular thing that they like put into their bodies very often, but it's also things like omega three fatty acids that are really important in things like cell repair and your energy levels, and all of these things are affected.
And we think it's really problematic that there are really easy ways to get more of this but a lot of people just don't have access because of how inaccessible fish has become recently with issues with over commercial farming that has made fish so much more expensive.
It's also a lean meat that is considerably better for the human body then the large amounts of carbs and fatty foods that we have in the status quo.
Like when people did research on which countries had the best diets in like the twentieth century you often had results that pointed to countries like china and like japan, that ate so much fish and included so much fish because of the kind of nutrients it can provide you on a very like healthy meat based as opposed to things that have a lot of fat or are high carb.
It also is really good because it means of these things are necessarily going to become cheaper.
In the status quo the reason that the price of fish, and especially good fish like tuna and salmon has been going up so much is that in is that we have been overfishing our oceans to the point where the supply has become very low but the demand continues to be very high, especially from countries as I mentioned like japan and china that use this as part of their regular like meals and their regular life.
So we actually think that providing more people with access to this means more people will get those necessary vitamins and those like better essentially supplements to your diet from like the things that we might be eating in the status quo.
But second under this, we think it does things that create jobs.
Recognize that a massive amount of research has to go into creating aquaculture based groups and aquaculture based infrastructure.
Because this is often times a lot of things that require like advanced efficiency, different kinds of conditions, you have to figure out which conditions are best for the type of fish that you're going to be growing, all of this requires scientists who are going to study them, it requires individuals who are creating that infrastructure, who are building that, who are designing it, and so you need people who are actually going to be running those farms.
So we think that it's actually quite important that we do this.
Both because it is like physically healthier but also because you can do things that create jobs and stimulate the economy through it.
Our second argument is about how it's good for the environment.
In the status quo there are massive amounts of commercial farming.
This pollutes our oceans, chemicals and equipment that are coming off of these boats and going into the ocean, and first of all also poisoning these fish which is contributing to the issue of almost killing off these kinds of animals, but also ending up in things like the water supply and destroying the ecosystems that are living within them.
We think that aquaculture can be done in a way that is uniquely sustainable in that you can use controlled conditions that can help keep wild ecosystems separate from fish bred for human consumption.
And we think that's something we're really lacking in the status quo.
Proud to propose."
"We should abolish foster care.
So, foster care is a system in which a minor who doesn't have legal guardians is given over to the care of some other individual.
Usually, people volunteer to be foster parents.
So, with that in mind, we think that this program, which is very common in the US and some other countries, as opposed to having orphanages, should be banned.
Our first argument is that there are many harmful incentives underlying the foster care system that lead to pernicious abuse.
Before I get into these points, the main argument I foresee the other side making against orphanages is that they are the site of widespread abuse.
But actually, a large percentage of foster parents do not treat their foster children well and many foster children are also victims of abuse, but there's at the same time very little oversight because it's so decentralized.
So we think that foster care actually leads to a huge amount of abuse and that it's more difficult to combat this than to combat it in centralized orphanages.
Here's why: you get paid to take in foster children.
What this means is that the kind of people who tend to adopt foster children are people looking for an easy paycheck rather than people who really care about the well-being of the children that they take in.
Whereas it cost a fortune to be an adoptive parent, you actually profit from having foster children.
So people try to spend less money than they receive from the government on their foster children so that they turn a profit, and also have an incentive to provide very low quality of life to these children in order to save money.
So they do things like take in several children, too many for their home to really comfortably accommodate, and make them live in basically the same conditions that they would live in at an orphanage or even worse.
They are hesitant to spend money on them for things like education or healthcare or other necessities, and ultimately these children live with a very low quality of life.
Many of these foster parents are not very kind to their foster children, and we think that ultimately this is a really harmful environment for these children to be in, because there's every reason to be abusive and to mistreat these children when they're just a paycheck at the end of the day.
Our second argument is that fostering is a poor use of state resources.
So, any government or jurisdiction, whether it be a city or a nation, has limited funds to spend on providing for orphans.
So what's the most effective way that we can provide for these children?
So, first of all, we have to consider that centralizing them into group homes which are run by the state is going to have a return much greater than putting them in foster homes, because we can provide resources to more children at once.
In other words, if you have a group home, then spending a few thousand dollars on a health clinic is likely to go farther than giving money for every individual foster parent to take their child to the doctor, because you can bring the doctor to them.
Similarly, if you need to provide clothes or food or other services, it's easier to do that and less expensive to do that if you have more people centralized in one location.
It's also easier to monitor and prevent abuse, because while it's true that the children might be at the mercy of whoever works at this group home, ultimately you can afford to do things, like regular checkups by an outside observer, at a group home at a much cheaper rate than what you could do for individual foster children who might only see their case worker very seldom.
What's more, while it's true that there might be problems with the children mistreating each other at a group home, we think that with modern amenities, it should be easier to help children get along.
We can afford to do things like give them smaller rooms rather than have them be in huge dorms, and it would still be cheaper than paying individuals to raise these children, who expect to make some sort of profit.
So for all of these reasons, we should abolish foster care.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should privatize the water supply.
What we mean by this is that rather than the government having de facto control over all water and distributing it a among individual people, we would have individual private corporations own and sell the majority of individual water supplies.
Three main areas of clash first, on liability.
We think it is generally just easier to class action sue a corporation than a government.
Insofar as it is very difficult to make the government expend money where as the government can make a corporation spend money on safety or any other thing that might be found that is doing wrong in a court of law.
The reason it is so difficult to make the government take action is because the government has even more infinite access to lawyers than even the biggest corporation and there's an incentive for judges not to convict the very employer that keeps them as judges in any court signed of court.
Basically it would be like me going into a police station to complain about a police officer.
We see how well that works given that the very system is created to protect those individuals that have been causing the problem in the first place.
Winning a really good example of where this was especially would've where it especially would've helped to have a privatize water supply is in flint michigan where even the most obvious sources of information on the water supply being damaged and spoiled show that there are show that but even with like the most it like graphic images of the water supply being bad were not enough for the government to take action to fix it.
Like flint michigan still does not have access to safe water.
However had this been occurring with a corporation, then multiple non profits would have lent the money to the individuals in flint michigan and they would have sued the corporation together and it would mean that not only would the water supply be fixed, but they would also likely receive compensation for past harms that could never occur with the government.
Insofar as suits against the government only require fixing everything in the future but do not require recompense for victims of past actions.
I think that oftentimes compensation is actually very important given that if I drink the water in flint michigan it is overwhelmingly probable that I will get very sick and that the money that is needed to be spent on my treatment will not be given back to me in any meaningful manner.
So we think that actually in terms of malpractice, it is very likely that it is preferable to have privatized water.
We also think that it's still possible for the government to regulate the water supply to regulate the prices of water right.
Like they can make sure that there's a max cost that cannot be exceeded in order for there to be even distribution across individuals regardless of race and regardless of of economic capability.
But we also think that it's just very likely that corporations don't want to overlook specific populations and have to keep in mind what those people can afford insofar as there are only so many rich people and they only demand so much water and in order to get rid of more water they will have to change prices across lands.
Our second independent point is about depoliticizing water because the government tends to have to bend to the will of the majority in that local district.
So if you're in a very in a very rich district that has a relatively small poor population it is much more likely that your water will be defluoridated because the rich people there care more about the taste of their water and know that they can afford to pay for fluoride toothpaste and so they are petty enough to take away that fluoride from everyone even though it's actually very important for individuals who don't have access or don't have the money for proper teeth care in terms of hospital bills and in terms of buying the right kind of toothpaste, to have access to fluoridated water and so we think that the private sector will actually solve for this much more insofar as it is it is likely that it would offer both options to the rich verses the non rich and so it would actually be much more likely that individuals could choose whatever they want.
Our third independent point is about competition leading to higher quality.
We think that corporations will always treat reservoirs and other water sources better than the government because they need people to buy into it and because they just have more money than the government.
We also think that when you force a bidding process for certain reservoirs, it's much more likely that they're going to be well maintained.
For this reasons proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban organic food.
We think that better framing for this debate round has to do with why we prioritize efficiency above like maybe the health of the kind of food that we consume.
We think it's important to note that with rising population numbers across the world come rising rates of world hunger and starvation.
The most important thing is just focus on these solutions before we start moderate increases perhaps in the health.
We will also dispute how healthy organic foods are later of those who are already at the top of the world in regards to how wealthy they are.
So, first, on our two areas of clash, why organic food is incredibly inefficient.
First we tell you that the amount of land mass that it requires is much larger than that of regular inorganic food.
This has to do with the fact that because of the way that organic food grows, they grow slower and with less yield, and so you need much more land in order to come up with an even comparable amount to the amount that you can grow in inorganic food.
So, say, for every two acres of land of organic food, I can fit the same amount of food into half an acre when I'm growing inorganic food.
This means that it's much more expensive to maintain, but also that it's much harder to feed the same amount of people with organic food as it is with inorganic food.
Second, we think that it requires much more water, because it can't be genetically engineered to keep its keep its need for water or sunlight or other resources low.
So not only is it more more temperamental so it needs to be grown in the correct temperature, it also requires much more of a valuable resource to be wasted on it in order to grow the same amount.
We think it's silly to reject the good that GMOs and other kinds of genetically engineered food have done for us because in the end, being able to engineer a food group to not mean the same amount of water, to not need the same amount of sunlight, has saved millions of lives.
And risking this because a couple of hipsters want to look good and feed their children organically is never a good idea.
More than this, we want to talk about the longer growing period that organic food requires.
Because what this what we can do with inorganic food is regardless of what the current season is or what the current harvest schedule is, you can change that in order to come up with more food in the long term.
Again, given the rising population, we think this is the most important thing in the round.
But finally, we think that the fact that you don't get to use pesticides in organic food means that you are much more prone to diseases, and these diseases spread much more quickly.
What this means is that organic foods are much more prone to crises than those that are inorganic because, at least with organic with inorganic food, if one of them gets a disease, you can cut that one out, spray them with pesticides and like insecticides and and like other things to get rid of the disease, and move on.
But with organic foods, one plant one diseased plant can kill off the entire field, putting you back to the beginning.
Our second main area of clash has to do with what with how inorganic food isn't actually significantly worse.
A lot of why organic food is so attractive to people is because of the marketing that is put behind it.
The demonization of inorganic food and the pedestal upon which organic food is put upon is largely a creation of capitalists, who want more money in their pockets from people who are gullible and willing to believe them.
We think it's not actually better for you.
They just want to make money, and sometimes they carry disease that inorganic foods don't, because those foods can actually be treated and you can make sure that they are safe.
We think the existence of the label itself is damaging, and that's why it ought be banned, because it causes an unfounded fear of inorganic food in people that causes them to spend exorbitant amounts of money on organic food and stop us from using that same land to produce much more needed GMOs that can feed more people in a healthier way.
We think that it's very dangerous that the world is falling for this ploy, where they're willing to pay so much for food that is not healthier for you, because GMOs can actively be changed in order to have more nutrients, and doesn't help the world as much.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should subsidize stem cell research.
So in this debate we're basically talking about harvesting stem cells from un-implanted human embryos so that we can use those stem cells to research treatments for diseases and the like.
So just so everyone is clear on the facts in this debate, the embryos that we harvest these stem cells from have not yet implanted, they're probably four to five days old, and consist of about a hundred cells.
So they're a little ball of cells and you pluck out the inside in order to access the stem cells that you need to do your research.
Right now the US government doesn't fund this.
Other governments around the world like south korea have been more positive towards it.
We think that countries like the US should allow stem cell research and also subsidize it.
Two arguments: the first is about the reasons why we think this would be beneficial for people with medical issues.
But first I want to provide an ethical framework for why we think this is acceptable.
The other team, I expect, is going to tell you that it is unethical to harvest stem cells from an embryo that will later grow into a person.
What we would tell you though is that while there are clearly shades of gray about when a person becomes a person, you know does it happen in the first trimester?
Or the second trimester?
Is a fetus a person?
There's no world of which you can claim that these embryos deserve the same human rights as you or I.
These embryos consist of a little ball of a hundred cells more like I don't know, some tiny sea creature or sponge, than they are like a primate.
We think that they lack the ability to feel pain or indeed to feel anything because they have no nervous system.
Such a being cannot have the same types of rights as you and I.
On the other hand, we have real individuals who are suffering from diseases that likely could be cured or at the very least made less severe using stem cell research.
People who do have rights.
We think we need to defer to those individuals rather than to defer to the possibility that an embryo may later develop into a being with rights.
So with that in mind, let's talk about curing these illnesses.
Stem cell research is a new frontier in treating certain diseases that are incurable right now.
We think that it's quite likely that many forms of cancer and other illnesses could be treated and that a tremendous amount of human suffering could be alleviated through the use of stem cell research.
Of course it's impossible to know that this will happen but at the very least by conducting this research we will likely gain a better understanding of how to help people versus what we have right now.
And something I'd like to point out is that harvesting stem cells from embryos is likely a temporary situation.
If we allow this research, it's likely that in the future we will gain the understanding to create stem cells through cloning or other processes without destroying human embryos.
So this is a temporary harm for a permanent good in terms of our medical knowledge.
We'll take that deal every time.
Our second argument is that even if you think stem cell research is bad in some ways, you should prefer that it happens in the US or EU countries versus happening in places like thailand where there is less regulation.
Why?
Obviously stem cell research poses some risk to the person from whom the embryo was removed, namely the mother of this embryo.
We think that if you care about protecting people's rights that you should want research go on in countries with the highest standards for ethics.
In other words, if there are developing countries where this research will be done when it's not permitted in the united states, and those countries have lower standards for the treatment of people in medical studies, then you should want the studies to be legal in america or britain so that the people participating are treated with more respect and given their human dignity in a way that they might not be in other places.
So for these two reasons we should subsidize stem cell research.
Thank you."
"We should subsidize public service broadcasters.
So in this debate what we're saying is that governments should set up institutions like the BBC in the UK, or PBS in the united states, which are public broadcasters on radio or television which create programming that meet certain standards for quality and neutrality which are set by the government.
So this might be set up at a local level like PBS is in the united states where every big american city has their own channel, or the national level like the BBC in britain where there is one BBC policy for the entire country.
We're fine with either one.
Three arguments for why we should subsidize these public service broadcasters.
The first is that we think that access to good unbiased information is essential for democracy.
In order for people to participate successfully in democracy they need access to information because their choice of candidate and their support for policies will be informed by what they know about it.
We think that ultimately, private broadcasters are always going to be very biased.
They're owned by certain individuals or companies that have particular political interests.
If you think about the rupert murdoch media empire his channel fox news in the US, or sky news in britain, do a lot to influence people in favor of conservative policies by sometimes misleading people or covering up shortcomings and conservative leaders and unfairly attacking liberal leaders.
We see that there is similar bias by liberal institutions in the US like the new york times, which are owned by very liberal owners as well and want to provoke their own narrative.
We think that a public broadcaster though can be held to much higher standards, that you can require things like neutrality in their publications and that on top of that because the people working there will be civil servants, that they will be forced to be nonpartisan in the same way that employees at say the tax ministry are forced to be nonpartisan in a given country.
Ultimately therefore, public service broadcasters provide people with unbiased information which will let them form their own decisions about which politicians to support and therefore which policies are in their own interest and that this will facilitate a healthier more participatory democracy than private broadcasters alone will.
Our second argument is that we think that these institutions can preserve the culture of a country.
No this may be less important in a very powerful country like the US, which has lots of cultural influence around the world.
But we think that in a country like canada, which is right next door to a much more powerful country, that ultimately there would be very little canadian media if the government didn't take steps to guarantee that it were created.
In other words, if you want to see your country producing domestic television and film we think that you need to subsidize it.
This is important because if you don't have public service broadcasters it's going to be much more difficult for your country to have the same kind of cultural output that other countries have.
We think that if you want to preserve your own culture, to educate people about your history, that public service broadcasters are ultimately the best way to do this.
Our last argument is that public service broadcasters prevent a race to the bottom in terms of the quality of media.
Realize that private companies want to make as much profit as possible, which means that they want to spend very little money on producing content so that they can pocket all of the profits.
This leads to a race to the bottom where every media company has to produce the worst possible quality of content in order to compete with its competitors because if they spend more money they will be less profitable and attract last investment.
You set a floor on this race to the bottom when you have public service broadcasters.
We think that this is true because if there is a base level of quality for the BBC or PBS, it is more difficult for private broadcasters to go far below this, otherwise viewers will just turn to the public service broadcaster for their information.
So on net we get a higher quality a private broadcast as well by having these public broadcasts.
So for these reasons, we should subsidize public service broadcasters.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should legalize prostitution.
Two main areas of clash.
The first on why it's why it is philosophically just for people to be able to be a prostitute and why this is a viable like path of work.
So first we tell you that prostitution is indistinguishable from any other career path.
Every job sells a part of our body in order to make money.
Op has to to prove why a prostitute's vagina is so different from the backs of construction workers or the brains of computer scientists.
Recognizing that other physical based jobs have much higher risks and yet somehow aren't regulated because recognize with prostitution as long as the male as the other person is wearing a condom, as long as you get regular STD checks, the risks are relatively minimal as long as you are being safe.
However, with jobs like construction, mining, any of these other physical labor jobs, it is almost guaranteed that you will have debilitating problems in the future such as like chronic back aches and back problems, like messing up your lungs very badly so that in the future you have higher risk for cancer.
We don't understand why we do not regulate those kinds of physical tasks but prostitution does.
Moreover we'd say that people own their bodies and that they should be able to sell them without regulation because if I can choose to go and be a ballerina, destroy my ankles and my knees, skip going to college and thus never be able to get a competent job in the future, I think it is also fair to say that I should be able to choose to use my body in the way of a prostitute as well insofar as I've probably had sex before, I know what the risks are.
It is the same as any other job.
We tell you it's arbitrary that the government restricts women's bodies, that it is based in a patriarchal society that allows men to make those decisions for women.
The only reason that we maintain these structures is because men still own the government and are able to like put these ideas into women's heads as well.
Decreasing the stigma around prostitution also decreases the stigma around women's bodies and their ownership of them in general.
More than this though, we tell you that the government isn't meant to restrict rights rather to protect them and the only time at which it would be justified to restrict them would be if there were meaningful third party harms or if the harm to yourself was so large that paternalism would be justified.
We told you why the harms for prostitution are no higher than any other physical menial job and if and and are actually oftentimes lower.
More than this, there are no third party harms insofar as the decisions we make with our bodies and who we have sex with impact only ourselves and our partner, as long as both a consensual.
It's unclear who the third party is.
At the point that we accept everything above, you already recognize why prostitution ought be legalized if only to remain philosophically consistent with how we regulate jobs already.
Our second area of clash has to do with regulate ability and safety.
Because a lot of people dislike prostitution because of the associated harms of prostitution, such as the idea that it is inherently seedy and associated with drugs or human trafficking but recognize that these problems go away with legalization because you can do things like mandate licenses that include SCT testing, then health codes, and background checks for consumers.
More than this though, it gives prostitutes legal recourse when pursuing justice.
Doesn't mean acknowledging that you broke the law.
In the status quo if I'm a prostitute who has been wronged by a pimp, who's being underpaid or abused, I have to go and first tell the courts that I am guilty of a crime before I can seek recourse.
We think it is absolutely necessary to allow women to be able to have a safe workplace regardless of what their current job is.
We also think that once you make things like human human trafficking less profitable because you can have woman consenting to it easily available for relatively cheap prices, it means you're no longer to having you're no longer having the same kind of associated illegal markets.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should privatize water supply.
So, what we're advocating for in this debate is that private companies should provide access to drinking water and the water for agricultural use, anything like that, in place of municipal governments.
So, in much of the world right now municipal or local governments provide access to water for people from a municipal water supply, we're just saying we think that it should be run by private companies which would compete on an open market.
We're okay with having regulation in terms of quality, we're okay with requiring that companies sell at a reduced rate to the elderly or to families with children but we think that it should be provided privately.
So, two arguments: the first is that governments around the world are doing an insufficient job providing people with safe clean drinking water.
We see that while it's true that many countries in europe or the united states provide people with safe clean drinking water, this is certainly not the norm around the globe.
Even in countries which have access to running water in every single home, places which are relatively highly developed.
Pick a country like turkey: everyone house water in their home in turkey.
It's a very highly developed country.
But the water is often not safe for people to drink, which means that local people have to go out and purchase drinking water or get filtration systems, or go through a long arduous process of the boiling and processing water in their home.
We think that this is proof that governments, even in relatively wealthy countries, are not able to satisfactorily provide people with access to clean safe drinking water.
Why do we think that private companies would do a better job?
In some countries around the world, such as bolivia, private companies have begun to supplant local governments as the providers of clean drinking water.
Now, bolivia is a much poorer country than turkey, to use the other example, but everyone there, effectively living in areas served by private water companies, has access to water that they can drink out of the tap.
The same that you would see in a country like canada or germany.
What we see is that because private companies have an incentive to compete against one another and to provide the best possible product, that ultimately they will provide higher quality of water them municipal governments.
We see that even in the US you have problems like governments failing to replace old pipes.
We think that local corporations would have much more of an incentive to maintain the infrastructure surrounding public water, because they need to have good infrastructure in order to sell their product and make money.
So we see that governments are failing to provide people with clean safe drinking water and that private companies would have a better incentive to actually do this.
For that reason we should privatize the water supply.
But our second argument is that this would lower cost overall.
Why is this true?
Municipal water companies, virtually everywhere in the world, have monopolies over the provision of water, which means that they have very little incentive to try to improve in order to lower costs.
It might be the case that investing a little bit of money up front would lead to lower costs in the long term for consumers, but municipal companies have no incentive to do so.
They keep using the infrastructure that was paid for whenever their municipal water company was set up, and they have no incentive to try to improve, to try to be more efficient.
They have no incentive to layoff unproductive employees or to experiment with new methods of providing water more cheaply because they get paid the same amount no matter what.
They also have no incentive to actually be sure that cost will remain affordable in the future, through things like maintenance, because they know that the taxpayer will pick up the cost of maintaining these facilities.
Private companies on the other hand want to experiment with new ways to deliver their product more cheaply because the money goes to them.
They want to layoff ineffective employees, they want to think about the long term to secure their own revenue in the future.
So we see that market incentives will actually lead to more efficiency and a better quality product being delivered to people at a lower cost.
So for these two reasons we should privatize the water supply.
Thank you."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should tighten gun control laws.
Two independent points, but first just a quick clarification.
In terms of tightening gun control laws, we're obviously approaching this from principle, as is consistent with the info slide, but we would say that we are willing to defend any sort of gun control law, anything from an assault weapons ban to a handgun ban to just, you know, longer waiting periods for obtaining guns, anything that makes it tougher to obtain a firearm is something that we would be willing to defend.
On the first independent point then, we'd say that firearms pose extreme physical danger, not just to people around the owners but also to the owners themselves, and that this physical danger warrants restrictions.
So, what are some of the dangers posed here?
One is just the availability of lethal force, that people are more willing to resort to extreme lethal force when the option is available.
For example, you know, if someone is , you know, in like a like a street fight or even defending their own home, something that, you know, could be resolved with like just punching or even like a like a knife fight or something like that, if someone is so intent on engaging in violence, can quickly be escalated by the fact that they have the availability of a more lethal weapon.
That in turn just makes conflict more likely, because it lowers the barrier to engaging in conflict.
I am much more comfortable fighting someone if I have a weapon that I know will, you know, make my chance of, you know, winning that conflict a lot higher.
But second, and closely related to this, is that capacity to do more damage.
I think a good example of this is, you know, the use of assault rifles in school shootings where even if a person is just absolutely intent on engaging in violence and it's going to happen no matter what, we want to, you know, raise the barriers to getting a gun so that the amount of damage that is done, it's just lesser.
Something like columbine, if conducted with a knife, will just basically wreak less havoc, create less suffering, because the weapon itself is something that is less effective at creating damage.
But thirdly, then, is the lack of proper training.
So we think that guns are quite complicated, to say the least.
This is something that you really have to know and understand to use, but a lot of people just simply don't.
People, you know, especially the romanticization of guns in media has led people to think that these are very simple things that, you know, you basically just press the button and the bullet comes out and you're done.
They're much more complicated than that, and it requires a lot of training and expertise to properly use a gun.
So we think that even restrictions that, you know, make you have to go through more to get a gun license, go through classes or more rigorous training, these are things that really ensure that people who use guns have a good understanding of them so that they are less likely to cause accidental harm to themselves or others.
Our second independent point is that there just often isn't a good use for these guns and that they are often purchased for reasons that are that are that are improper.
So I think one particularly good example of this is home defense, where often guns will actually cause more problems than solutions in defending one's home.
You know, specifically with assault rifles, there are lots of examples of people, you know, shooting people in neighboring apartments because they didn't understand that if they, you know, just fire off an assault weapon, it will cause a lot of havoc in surrounding areas.
But even with smaller guns, like handguns, this can often escalate the situation to one where an home intruder has no choice but to fight for their life, and the situation escalated quite quickly can result in fatalities.
We think that because these guns are so often utilized in improper scenarios, if you increase the barriers to getting a gun, you will see less improper usage essentially, that it will be seen as something that is, you know, less commonplace, less useful for everyday situations and as such, much less likely to be used in those situations.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish electronic voting.
We mean by this is that we would essentially not allow any kind of vote that like has an impact on an official election to occur over an electronic force so whether this is voting machines, whether this is the internet, so on so forth.
I think the main thing we're trying to get across in this round is that elections are incredibly important and we can't sacrifice security for the sake of efficiency.
That is we buy that electronic voting in vast ways can improve the efficiency and accessibility of voting, but we don't think that it matters because the fact that it is so much easier to corrupt, to delegitimize entire elections in entire states under that kind of system means that we can never risk that.
This is something we have to be absolutely risk averse to and never allow.
Some things are just inefficient by nature and we have to continue to do them because they're integral to our society and we think that voting is one of those things in the same way that even though the DMV is awful we still need people to get their licenses and we still need to track those things like bureaucracy to a certain extent occurs because we need it to occur because it helps in like fundamental processes and because oftentimes without it we end up with issues of security such as what I'm talking about.
Three main areas of clash, first on hacking because I think when we say security it often means in a very literal sense.
Elections are high high risk activities in that it's something that a lot of people have vested interest in, there's a lot of money floating around, and we think that if there's the potential to hack something that has an electronic connection in a way that can never be done with paper methods and that is something that we need to ultimately avoid.
It is infinitely easy easier for us to have conversations about how hackers were able to like derail an entire election and like that's something that is much more likely to happen than for like hackers who change the votes on paper ballots like that's just something that doesn't happen.
It's infinitely easier to like screen your volunteers than to try and make a more secure internet that's something that we just can't do.
Our second area of clash is about election fraud.
We think the problem is that this is always going to be easier with electronics because it's a lot easier to say that like oh look like all the machines turned off but this was the vote when we counted it or to change manually the responses of the votes in the vote counters on electronic voting than it ever is with paper.
If only because it is just infinitely more likely infinitely more difficult for us to ever have a moment where we're like oh man I lost all these paper ballots and not be suspicious.
We think that people expect mistakes to happen with technology in a way they don't expect it to occur with something like paper ballots.
Finally though I just wanna talk generally about why electronic voting is more accident prone because I think something the're going to have to run into on their side over and over and over again is that it's a lot more difficult for us to watch over electronic voting than it is over paper voting in that like okay so you like you spill something on a bunch of paper ballots like first this is just infinitely more easy thing to avoid you keep your ballots separated but something like unplugging a machine on accident something like having a electricity shut down on the same day like all of these risks are additive in a lot of ways especially when you aggregate them across an entire country or across the entire world.
We think the problem on their side of the house is that regardless of how efficient it gets, even one election that gets hacked and someone gets put into a regime that shouldn't be there or has bad intentions like even one election where there's voter fraud like one election where all the votes are lost all these things instantly negate the entirety of electronic voting because it is so much of a higher risk.
Proud to propose."
"International adoption brings more good than harm because first, it gives incredible benefits for the children who are actually being adopted, it gives them a much better life, and second, I think that international adoption is also good for society, I think that it's good for combatting societal problems like overpopulation, and I also think that it leads to better social integration, diversity and nationalistic understanding.
So, before I get into those arguments though, I want to talk about what this means.
Because something bringing more good than harm doesn't mean that it's going to be perfect.
Obviously there are going to be problems like human trafficking, these things exist, and obviously these things are bad.
However, these are still things that I think can be fought with regulation, fought with law enforcement, and I don't think that these are things that are necessarily inherent to international adoption in the same way that the benefits are, and therefore it's something that we should necessarily strive to keep and strive to make better, but not eliminate or lessen.
So let's start by talking about why international adoption is great for the kids that are being adopted.
Because recognize that a lot of these people are coming from objectively bad circumstances.
They are coming from circumstances where there's a lack of hard resources for them, there could be shortages of food, shortages of water, shortages of education or healthcare services, either in the countries as whole, or more specifically problems as a result of underfunding of systems for underfunding of like a domestic support systems for adopted people and foster care systems.
And in addition to that, I also think that there is the psychological elements that come with a lack of the lack of human love in the same way, for the lack of a family, the lack of connections in the same way, that's also important.
And obviously adoption corrects these things, because you usually see these adoptions taking place from like more like infertile western families, or like do-gooders in the west.
And I think that this is good, because these tend to be people who have access to more resources, have access to higher qualities and standards of living, so you're directly making the lives of children better.
There it's hard to argue that that's an incredibly important and good thing to do.
I also think that parents are going to give these children a lot of love.
I think that in a lot of ways it's going to be even a higher order of love.
Because it's going to be a love that you essentially create as a result of being with that person and being a part of this person's life for since their since their birth, even if they weren't naturally born, through all their childhood.
You're still gonna witness all of their like evolutions of life in the same way, you're still going to be a constant guiding force throughout their life.
This is still parenting and love and human connections in an incredibly meaningful way and an incredibly enriching thing.
The next thing that I'm going to talk about is how this is going to help society more broadly though, because I think that this is pretty important too.
First, I think that adoption is just good because, as opposed to natural birth, it does more to help with overpopulation, because you're not you're like not just adding more people to the world.
This is obviously good, because you don't want overpopulation because there's health concerns associated with it, with like higher densities and things like that, there's environmental concerns with humans using too much too many resources and the like.
So all that's important, but there's also the matter of diversity and cultural understanding, and I think one of the biggest things that leads to a lot of conflicts around the world is we tend to put ourselves in boxes and isolate ourselves.
And I think that when you have more immigration, when you have more adoption of international communities and things like this, this means you're more likely going to have a real human face and a real personal connection with the people that may be on the other side of the world even.
And this is a much better way to actually foster intercultural understanding, foster intercultural relations, and all of those things are, besides just being in more enriching for like your life, because you're learning more about the world, I think it's better for like international relations and the like as well.
So for all those reasons, very proud to propose."
"International adoption brings more good than harm.
So as an example of what we mean by international adoption, this might be parents in the US choosing to adopt children from russia, say, which is something that's become fairly common in the last few decades.
So three arguments for why we think that this brings more good than harm.
But first, just to be clear what we're debating about, we'd recognize that there are going to be harms on both sides of the debate.
We think that what we have to prove it's not that international adoption is completely good, but the good it does outweighs the harms that it also does.
So with that in mind, three arguments.
First, this is good for the children who get adopted.
What you tend to see with international adoption is children who live in middle income countries or developing countries being adopted by parents living in much wealthier countries.
We think that especially given that these are children who are probably living in orphanages, or in state run homes that ultimately these children are not going to be able to receive a lot of resources in their current environment.
We think that these children are much more likely to be able to exercise their rights and freedoms if they're adopted to a more developed country.
Why is this true?
First of all, in terms of access to things like healthcare, it's probably going to be a lot better if you're looking at the kind of parents who are wealthy enough to be able to internationally adopt a child.
In terms of access to higher education, in these developing countries it's likely to be more difficult for them to go on to access higher education or professional education, so we think that they'll be more likely to be able to choose the career that is best for them and ultimately to support themselves and have a good life as a result of being adopted by these parents.
And lastly, we think that these children will be better off because look, if somebody is going through the process of international adoption and all of the difficulties that that includes, we think these people must really want to adopt this child.
So we think it's very likely that this is going to be a loving home.
Whereas if the alternative's that these children are in orphanages, I'm sure that the people who work there are good people who are doing the best that they can, but that child would be better off in a loving home.
So it's clear that this is best for the children and we think that they're the ones who should be most concerned with in this debate, because these children can't advocate for or help themselves.
Or second argument is that this is good for the adopting parents.
Presumably, if people are looking to go through the expense of international adoption, they weren't able to have children in the normal way.
Maybe there's a shortage of children to adopt in their own country, this is true in the US, and also in other countries like in scandinavia or the netherlands, and presumably these are people who aren't able to naturally have children.
Perhaps it's a same sex couple, or perhaps it's just people who are for whatever reason unable to have children.
Clearly these people are better off because they're now able to become parents, which is obviously something that's very important to them, and this will help them to self actualize and live long happy lives.
Our third argument is that this is better for the country that these children were adopted from.
We tell you that it's a big risk, especially in a developing country, to have lots of young people who are disaffected or alienated and don't have a lot of opportunities.
And this is what you see when you have lots of children living in orphanages, because those children grow up, they turn sixteen or eighteen, they leave the orphanage, and they still don't have the resources or the safety net to be able to support themselves in an effective way, so we think it's more likely that these young people will either a, turn to crime, or b, become radicalized.
We see that the types of places that tend to have a problem with radicalism are often those that were war zones twenty, fifteen years ago, and that's often the case because there are lots of young men who feel disconnected from society, who are vulnerable to these leaders who want to radicalize them.
So we think that ultimately, it'll be better for these countries to have these children go to loving homes rather than to have them remain and potentially cause trouble in the future.
But on top of that, not having to have the massive expense of running these orphanages and providing for these children will also reduce the burden on the state and allow them to spend more on other issues within their own country.
So for these three reasons, we think that international adoption brings more good than harm.
Thank you."
"We should legalize public nudity.
First argument: there is no such thing as decency.
Sometimes it's easy to forget that eventually we are nothing but animals.
If we take a quick look at the animal kingdom we will see that animals have never never felt ashamed of their naked bodies.
They have never felt the need to cover certain parts of their body up.
This can teach us that the demand for what we today call decency is nothing but a completely random social construct and every link that people try to make between decency and morality is both ridiculous and oppressive.
Another such evidence is that the concept of what's considered decent and what isn't has developed completely differently in different places and different times throughout the world.
There is no definition of decency that has consistently lingered through time.
In certain african tribes it is customary for women to walk around with their bare breasts out in the open, whereas in orthodox societies a woman that so much as exposes her hair is considered indecent.
We would also like to to to shed light on the fact that in the absolute majority of cases it is mostly women that have been forced to withstand the most strictest standards of decency.
Note how up until this very day, even in the most liberal of societies, a man that walks around in public without a shirt is like is often forgiven or like encountered with a lot more patience than a woman that would walk around not wearing a shirt.
How can all of this be explained?
Easily.
We say that decency is a concept that was made up by the strong class in society, as a form of oppression to the weaker class.
It's easy to understand that when we consider the muslim society and burkas for instance.
The idea is that even if today it is no longer so and not necessarily effectively used as a means of oppression, and and even if it applies to to men and women alike, that is the source and the origin of this custom or this norm and there is absolutely no explanation that can be defended rationally.
Second argument: a vital part, like, nudity is a vital part of the freedom of expression and there is no good enough justification to limit it.
So this argument engages with the opposition in case they try to argue that irrespective of the origin of this norm, the fact is that today nudity you know disturbs people and therefore we should ban it to allow everyone access to the public sphere or something like that.
We say that the public sphere, unlike the private sphere, is by definition a dangerous space in which you might encounter things that you will not like.
We say that the mere fact that something bothers you is just not interesting in terms of justifying banning that thing.
And up, and like, up until the point that you are able to prove that some objective damage has taken place, that just doesn't matter that it bothers you.
There are plenty of people that are on the conservative side and they are really bothered by seeing people with that walk around with tattoos, or with a mahican hairdo.
We say that they believe that it's a promiscuous behavior and immoral behavior and that it has a bad effect on their children.
Does opposition really want to consider this as a good enough and like sufficient cause to ban people walking around in public with tattoos and mahican?
We say like, what about people that are bothered by seeing gay couples kissing in the street?
You see, the thing is that once you give weight to what bothers some of the people this necessarily means that you trample over the rights of others, and we believe that walking around naked is a completely legitimate form of expression that conveys a message, and perhaps even a very important criticism over the existing norms that are outdated in society.
We believe that the true test for the level of commitment of a society in protecting the freedom of expression of its citizens is exactly at the point at which a certain form of expression bothers other people.
That is exactly where it matters that we protect it.
Third argument: really quickly, we think that if if there would be more people that walk around naked this will help a lot of other people overcome problems that they experience today with negative body image and insecurity.
We say that the more that you get exposed to other naked bodies in all shapes and colors and forms, you understand that no matter how your body looks like there are plenty of other people just like you, and if they are not ashamed then you have nothing to be ashamed of.
For all of these reasons we're very proud to propose."
"We should prohibit unisex bathrooms.
So in this debate, what we mean by prohibit unisex bathrooms is not that we're going to have a total ban.
If you're a private business that wants to have unisex bathrooms that's your decision.
But when we're prohibiting unisex bathrooms we're going to say that in public spaces we would not allow them, that any publicly funded buildings, any government buildings, all these types of things we would not allow unisex bathrooms.
So, let's talk about why we think this is how the government should proceed.
We think that the general principle we're going to be talking under is that we simply do not believe that the state should legislate for the small minority, that when making decisions the state should ultimately proceed in a way that the majority of people agree with.
So let's talk about why that is.
The government by its nature is meant to be conglomeration of citizens' beliefs.
The reason for this is several fold.
The first is that the government is ultimately an amalgamation of its citizens.
The government as a body represents its citizens on the national stage and serves to protect its citizens in the domestic sphere.
We think that all citizens need to be given equal value for a few reasons.
First in order to apply laws equally across all groups, to ensure that the state has a just application of the laws on its books, citizens need to be viewed equally so as to not get special distinctions or privileges in a legal sense.
Secondly, we think that you need to ensure that social divisions do not become equivalent with political strength, that is to treat all people as equal ensures that no matter the the wealth level of a person, no matter the level of distinguished nature of someone's of someone's work or someone's actions that they're still given the same equal political strength.
And finally we think that it's the case that all people are constrained by the government in equal degrees because there's an equal application of the law all people are essentially subject to the coercive of apparatus of the state in similar ways and therefore all should have a say in the equal sh-all should have an equal say in the constraints.
We think that necessarily if you're going to value all people equally, then when you're passing such prohibitions or making such restrictions you do so in reference to the general will of the populace.
We think therefore government legislation should be decided by aggregating the preferences of the whole inciting laws that most people would agree with.
We think that this system is designed to help transgendered individuals that having unisex bathrooms is meant to accomidate a very small portion of the population.
However there are far more people who are uncomfortable with the idea of unisex bathrooms.
There are people that simply do not believe that transgender lifestyles are healthy or in in many other instances and the vast majority of people simply don't feel with the idea of people from the other gender or the other sex being in the same bathroom as them.
We think that given that this is the case that there are huge populations and huge amounts of people that don't like these things that feel deeply uncomfortable these things especially in a sphere that is incredibly personal your bodily functions are something that were taught from childhood are a very personal aspect of who you are we think in those areas the most people should be made the most comfortable and we think that in order to do that prohibiting the use of these things in public spaces like publicly owned buildings and schools are the best ways to ensure that you are passing laws and you're building these schools and you're designing these types of public spaces with the majority in mind that you make the space safer for those in the majority.
This doesn't mean that private businesses or that private practices that aren't part of the majority that don't believe in the majority can't act in that way but we think that in order for the government to be fundamentally just it must act in line with the majority and that in this case because the transgender group of people is massively out is massively outpaced by those that are simply uncomfortable with the idea of unisex bathrooms we should prohibit unisex bathrooms."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should cancel the speed limit.
What we mean by this is that we would return the speed limit to a state right, as it used to be in the united states.
State legislature can still impose certain limits on one-lane roads, however, on any highway or more than one-lane road, we would say that you have to have no limit at all, although we would stick with the whole, like, left being a passing lane, the farther left you go, the faster you want to go, whereas people who want to be slower can be in the right lane.
With that, two main areas of clash: first, on why this is entirely unnecessary.
So recognize that in the united states, speed limits were first federally imposed, originally as a response to the nineteen seventy three oil crisis.
It wasn't because anyone thought that speeding was unsafe, and it wasn't because of any kind of accident statistics, rather it was because the like the middle eastern countries had tightened down on providing oil to the US because they didn't like their politics with israel, and oil had gotten really expensive.
So it was determined that the fifty-five area speed limit was the one in which they were most efficient with regards to their gas usage.
But we live in a really, really different world right now.
Technology is so far advanced that at any speed, we are much more efficient than back in those years of the oil crisis.
Also, even though safety was not really the original reason that this was instituted, if you're worried, car builds are now a lot safer.
The addition of extensive crumple zone, better airbag technology and sensing, and seatbelt detection, make it so that it it's actually very, very safe to drive, even at very fastest speeds, and even if you crash, you're actually much more likely to survive.
Moreover, we think that it's actually safer if people are driving with the mutual understanding of what your speed is going to be.
Because currently, there are some people who follow the rules and, like, stick to the listed speed limit, but there are many, many who speed whenever they think they won't get caught.
This creates a more dangerous situation because you're much more likely to end up with one person being very, very slow, one person is speeding, and then, suddenly, they don't they don't realize that there's someone in front or behind them who's going much slower or faster, and you end up crashing, or you have much more situations in which someone stops furiously, and someone who's driving faster behind them is going to hit them.
We think if you're specifically dividing these lanes, such as with the autobahn, where you have a section in which people who want to speed can sit, and then a section in which people who want to drive slowly can, you're actually going to end up with a much safer driving situation as a whole.
We also think that you actually help combat traffic, because a lot of the time what happens is that traffic is partially caused by some people going incredibly slowly on the road, and it's ended up being a bottleneck.
And we think that if you have a world in which the passing lane is actually used for passing, rather than having people there who are driving fifty-five, just for the sake of driving fifty-five, at the most busy time of the day, you're actually going to minimize traffic.
This is environmentally friendly because cars standing in a line, releasing emissions, is pretty bad for the environment.
Our second independent point is maximizing individual freedom.
The government has no business in speed limits.
There's no government interest, there is no external harms.
This is the government overstepping their boundaries and regulating individual movements, and we think that this is quite against what democracy actually means, right?
Like, democracy is about striving to be as free as possible, because the individual understands their context best and deserves to exercise their rights as they choose.
So we think what's actually going on is the government collects an unjust source of revenue by punishing those who happen to go above an arbitrary limit the government didn't have a right to set in the first place.
We also think it's overly rigid.
It doesn't account for individual circumstances, such as being late to an important event, or, like, maybe you have an interview, maybe your wife's giving birth.
Like, in the end, the policeman doesn't know that and neither does the government, and so you we think that as long as you're being safe, you ought be able to drive as fast as you want.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"Boarding schools should be abolished because they're exclusionary, they deter social ability, and because they're quite bad for children as well and they allow parents to skirt their parental obligations.
So let's start by talking about why boarding schools are bad for society.
Keep in mind that most boarding schools are expensive and prestigious institutions.
Like a lot of prominent examples are like eton in england.
Eton is known as like one of the like most like like the bougiest boarding schools in a world where like they send everyone to cambridge and oxford and other places like that.
You have places in america too that function in similar ways.
You have military academies that also do these kinds of things designed to instill these like archaic puritan era values into the youth and things like that and I think that in a lot of ways this is incredibly problematic because what they oftentimes amount to are essentially theater systems for the youth of aristocrats into the so called social elites in society.
And the way that this often works is that if you had like maybe family members who went these prestigious boarding schools, or you have you're just someone who has a large degree of financial resources and can be a donor, you're able to secure spots in these like prestigious high schools or middle schools or even lower schools and things like that and this puts people at a disadvantage.
It gives people a competitive advantage as far as getting into colleges and future earnings and things like that.
I think that it's very bad because it also takes away from investment in public schools and it takes away the need for wealthy people to be reliant on the public school system.
So it also makes it more likely that it's going the public school system is seen as almost a second or a lower class system rather than something that's supposed to serve the public and I think that's a big problem and one of the biggest things that can keep social mobility evident in a society but the second reason why I think that boarding schools are very bad is I think that they're bad for children as well and I think that they're bad in a couple of ways.
First, I think that they're bad in that they they harm the bond that children are supposed to have with their parents and I think that the idea that you can just the bond especially when you're growing up, the bond to the most important people in your life that they can just like ship you off to a boarding school and leave you there and that you're going to have the same kinds of experiences, the same kind of like emotional experiences and things like that, is absolutely ludicrous because when you go to places especially like if it's like a military academy, but most boarding schools are like this is well, things that are oftentimes evident there is you're going to have rather restricted freedoms, you're going to be in dormitories full time that are going to be very strict, you're not going to be able to have like all that much freedom to like go out and do things like that, you're not going to be able to just like go out in the society and learn, you're not going to be able to have the same experiences growing up with just like like friends and things like that, in like a normal environment.
It's oftentimes going to be seen as like a very isolating environment.
You're not going to get the same skills of interacting.
You're not going to be able to interact with your parents who are supposed to be like very very important you and things like that and I think that all of these things deprive children of their childhoods in a lot of ways and can stunt their like emotional development and their social growth which is just as important as any kind of academic or intellectual growth and this is also just a way for parents to skirt parental obligations in that you can make raising your child essentially somebody else's problem and I think that's ridiculous.
Like you could have kids are you cannot have kids that's your choice, but if you're going to have kids then you should be prepared to meet those obligations, to raise them, to be a constant influence in their lives not just send them out somewhere else and hope they're going to turn out okay.
I don't think that's a good way to actually effectively raise the future generation in society.
So for all those reasons, boarding schools should be abolished."
"We should subsidize public transportation.
So, for the purpose of the debate, we would say that when we subsidize it, we're going to do it fairly robustly, we're going to ensure that there is both more transportation opportunities within urban areas, so more more things like subways and other ways to commute with in urban areas, and we would additionally ensure that transportation is developed, to allow people to commute from more rural or suburban areas into urban areas.
So, not just increasing the amount of subways we have, but increasing the amount of trains, and other types of transportation, that bring people into urban areas.
Alright.
Two main arguments: the first is why this allows for more social mobility, and the second is that it's simply better for the environment.
So why is it better for social mobility?
We would say that, the vast majority of jobs, that exist, exist in the status quo in urban areas.
This is because jobs and employers want to move in to urban areas, because it gives them a larger base of employment to draw from.
The other thing is that, people need people need to commute into these areas, and people need to go to these areas to get jobs.
The problem is that it's simply expensive for many people to be able to commute.
People can't afford to have their own their own private cars, and if they can't commute easily on their own, through their own economic value, we think that we should subsidize the ability for people to move into these areas, to collect jobs, and to try and get these jobs.
We think that, the people, that can't afford to transport themselves in the status quo, are the people that are in most need of these jobs, these are the lowest class of people in society, and these are the people that are often at the lowest rates of employment, in the lowest rates of well being.
And because of this, we think it is absolutely crucial that we allow them to be more connected to these urban areas.
But secondly, and we think more importantly, is that this is simply cleaner for the environment.
Public transportation allows for a much lower level of emissions than large amount of people driving into the city, with their cars.
Recognize that, in the status quo, approximately eighty percent of people commute on their own every day, which means that in the same amount of space that you could put a bus, there are two or three people that are driving to work.
And not only that, not only does it mean that we will have less congestion, if you have say, thirty people going on a bus, instead of thirty people driving their own cars into work on the highway, but you also have fewer emissions, even if buses on balance, create more emissions than a single car, you're simply decreasing the amount of vehicles that are on the road.
This solves two problems: the first is that, there is an immense amount of congestion the status quo, which leads to people wasting a large amount of their lives commuting.
People spend two, three hours a day of their life, five days a week, getting to work, getting from the suburban areas into urban areas.
We think if you allow for more public transportation, and you subsidize public transportation, so that it's a cheaper option, people are more likely to choose to take these public transportation options.
The second is obviously that it means you have much lower emissions, you've lower pollution, and things like this.
We think that this is crucial.
Recognized that in the status quo, we're approaching a global warming tipping point, where approaching a point at which, if we don't make drastic changes to the level of emissions were putting out, we're going to make irreversible damage to our environment.
We think that, subsidizing public transportation, not only allows for people that are less economically well off to move into areas, or to commute to areas where you have more jobs, it also means that you're doing less damage, and the damage, that is almost certainly going to disproportionately impact these people in the lowest classes, is done away with.
So given that, if you increase public transportation, you decrease the amount of congestion, especially in urban areas, you decrease the amount of pollution, and you allow for more economic mobility and social mobility amongst people through all economic classes, but especially the lowest economic classes, we say that we should subsidize public transportation."
"We should privatize the military.
On our side we think it would be better for countries to rely more heavily on independent contractor groups, like blackwater, rather than standing militaries.
We have a few arguments for our side, the first is that contractors are actually easier to hold accountable than the military.
Here's why: if you have a contractor that does a really bad job, for instance, if they fail to achieve their objectives or if they run way over budget on a project, you can choose not to renew their contract.
And because they knew this, we think it's very likely that they will be held to a higher standard, whereas the military has no competition.
The US army doesn't have to worry that if they do a bad job that a bid will go out for another group, like the british military or something, to come in and take their job.
They know that they can spend as much money as they want and not necessarily always be as successful as we would like them to be, but that they'll never be replaced and that no one's going to lose their job as a result.
We think, on the other hand, that if you have contractors, this would be a very lucrative business, what would attract several different companies into that market.
As a result, it's very likely that there would be intense competition for big bids.
For instance, imagine if the US invasion of iraq had been broken up into a few different contract bids, each worth a hundred billion dollars.
I think the whole war cost six hundred billion, so you can imagine that this would draw companies like vultures to a corpse.
As a result, I think it's very likely that you would be able to hold these companies accountable due to that amount of competition.
Our second argument is that this would save lots of money in peacetime.
Maintaining a standing army, as countries like the US or britain or israel have to do, is very expensive, because you're paying lots of soldiers to just train or to keep themselves in fighting shape but not actually do anything on your behalf.
Yes, it's true that soldiers do fill valuable roles in times like natural disasters but, generally speaking, for the US to have three million people employed by the military means that those people aren't working in productive jobs, and it's not an insult.
I mean that, literally, they don't produce anything compared to people who work in factories or research and things like that.
But not only that, you're also saving lots of money because you can just choose not to renew a certain contract during peacetime, making it very cheap and easy to downsize.
So I think that, as a result, countries would be able to spend more of their money in times of peace on investment in their development or investment in their own society and that this might create a more peaceful country, overall, that doesn't need the military as much, which seems to me like the best possible outcome of any change in military policy.
After all, the best world would be one in which people don't need militaries at all, so any step we take towards that would be an improvement.
And our final argument is that this would allow countries to go to war and have many fewer people sent to their deaths.
Why is this true?
One big problem with most countries' militaries is that they rely on conscripts.
This isn't true in the US, but the fact that so many soldiers are drafted straight out of high school and don't receive a huge amount of training means that there's sometimes a similar effect.
It would be better to use contractors than conscripts, certainly, and sometimes maybe better than professional soldiers, because their training would be much better.
It'd be so expensive for these contractors to bring someone in and get them up to speed that it would be a real investment in personnel for them, so obviously they want to keep these people alive.
As a result, they're going to have better training and equipment than the average soldier, at least in many countries, so we think it's likely that many fewer of them will die in conflicts.
The other side might say this is bad because people won't take conflict as seriously if there aren't a lot of deaths, but considering the tiny number of americans who died in iraq and the massive backlash against the war, I just don't think that holds up, and I also think that fewer people dying in war is just generally a good thing.
For all these reasons, we should privatize the military.
Thank you."
"We should ban home schooling because it does a lot of damage to children.
And I think that the biggest thing that we have to start off with is that any of the harms that come with home schooling, which I'll explain in a minute, it's important to put this in the context of choice and agency for the child.
Because when you're talking about home schooling this isn't something that kids have any reasonable degree of control over.
Parents obviously should have some degree of autonomy over how they wanna raise their child.
That's fine.
But when it comes to a very basic things, like the ability of a child to socialize, the ability of a child to get an education, the possibility of future success for that child, those are things that are going to affect the child to the rest of their life.
Well into their adulthood and beyond that.
So it's important to make sure that the best decision is being made on behalf of that child.
And I think that when it comes to home schooling that is almost never the best decision for that child.
So let's talk about reasons why this is the case.
So first there's social consequences to this and this is obvious.
You're first not really socializing with friends, you're less likely going to make human connections with people, so not having friends can be something that can be psychologically harmful to a lot of kids.
But beyond that you're also not learning how to socialize with adults outside of your family in the same way.
You're not interacting with teachers you're not interacting with other adults.
And all of those things can have profound consequences on later life.
They can have consequences on your ability to do basic things in the business world, obviously, like network, ability to connect with people, but beyond that they're also going to probably affect your ability to be satisfied and happy with your life.
Because you're not going to really develop a lot of social skills, you're not going to develop as many friendships, all things that are probably going to lead you being less happy, which is obviously not a good thing.
But beyond that, I also think that home schooling is going to have a direct consequence of your education.
Because by and large, professional teachers, people who actually get paid to teach are going to be able to do a better job than parents are going to be able to do, or some kind of like religious instructor or anything like that.
The by and large public schools or even a or private schools or whatever, like, but educational institutions are pretty effective in making it so that you actually learn various things.
And that's important because there's more qualified people.
But beyond that there's also something about learning in groups.
You learn it with you could do group projects, you learn teamwork, you learn all various kinds of skills.
And that's important because a lot of the work you're going to do in later life is going to be in the context of working with other people.
And if you're not able to like do like learn with other people like divide projects with other people, things like that, you're probably not going to get that far.
So you're not going to learn as many things that are going to be good, you're going to have a worse education and you're also going to miss out on skills that are uniquely important.
But finally I also think that it's important to look at the reality of why a lot of people choose to get home school.
And I think that a lot of parents choose to home school their children often to avoid giving them a legitimate education.
So whether it's trying to avoid trying to force on the child a religious education and then try to deprive them of the opportunity to have a public education because of that, whether it's someone who's like famous like a child celebrity, or whether it's like lavar ball who is playing lamelo ball out of high school, things like that.
Like usually these choices are being made for some kind of our religious reason, some kind of financial reason, but not necessarily because it's in the best interests of the child.
And I think that's a real problem because you should be able to just avoid school under the auspices of a of a home schooling education.
So for all those reasons, we should ban home schooling."
"We should increase internet censorship.
So we're not gonna talk specifically about the model for how we're going to do this, we think that as a general principle, government should try and increase the amount of internet censorship.
So when we're talking about censorship we're not saying filtering based on what's good for the government, we're saying that there is certain information that is fake or hateful that we think is being perpetuated on the internet to a massive degree and that that type of content should be censored.
Not that not the the content not the what is composed of the content.
So not the ideas that are being spread themselves but either the hate or the accuracy, the validity, these would be the basis for how we would censor.
So that being said, two big arguments: the first is about fake information.
In the status quo the internet presents virtually unlimited opportunity for speech.
This has allowed anyone to say anything they want even without sources to back up their claims or anything more than their own words and this has been able to be blasted out there with a reach of thousands or millions of people.
We can see empirically that this massive influx of news and information has made people wary of all new sources.
The fact that there are so much more information out there, the fact that there are so many people perpetrating themselves as as valid news sources has confused the general public and in the end people end up picking sources that confirm their existing believes, even if those sources are largely incorrect and this has huge implications.
First, we think you clearly get a worst informed public that leads to a bad voter base.
What we mean by a bad voter base is that because people are working off of false assumptions, they ultimately vote against their interests which we think is an objectively bad decision for those people and something that should be avoided.
Additionally, this allows politicians to hide behind partisan news sources to hide their shady behavior.
For example, when you have a president like donald trump who's able to use right wing sources such as breitbart news to back up the false facts that he is putting out there, it puts more validity for his political acts when there is at in a in a realistic sense, in reality no backing for what he is stating.
This also creates a more divided society because people from different political perspectives are suddenly operating under entirely different fact sets.
We move from a time in which different political opinions were about a difference in how you believe we needed to proceed as a society and they've now become a difference of how you view the actual reality that we are living in and how you view the dangers that are presented to us based on an entirely different set of information which we think is incredibly harmful for public discourse and it's incredibly harmful in a variety of specific issues such as global warming and vaccinations that have real massive impacts.
Secondly we think that there are bad communities springing up on the internet.
We think that online spaces are becoming hotbeds for hate groups for three reasons: first, it's easier to collect other members from a small minority and recognize members of hate groups are a very small minority of the population and it's easier to gather those people when you're not confined by geography.
Secondly, anonymity allows people to spew hate with very little with with very little fear that they're going to be caught, with very little fear that that hate's going to be attached to their name and finally it's very easy to find these groups.
You can just use a simple search engine to find these things.
This has created a renaissance period for hate groups and a rise of nationalism more generally.
These communities pose real threats to minorities and other marginalized people.
Their bodily autonomy and their peace of mind should be preserved and we think the government has an obligation to fight these hate groups that real not only threaten them vocally threaten these minority groups vocally but also when they get into this group think space, when they get into these online communities and they start blowing up each other's own thoughts we think that it creates a sphere in which people become much more likely to act on those violent thoughts, on those hateful thoughts, which we think poses real life and very serious implications for these groups.
For these reasons we should increase internet censorship."
"We should subsidize higher education, and the standard that we're going to set this round is that in countries which currently subsidize secondary and primary education we think that higher education should be treated in the same way.
So for instance, in a country like the united states or canada, where secondary education is completely free at the point of use and no one pays money to attend public high schools, we think no one should pay any money to pay public colleges as well.
So we would have the state completely fund tuition at public universities.
So this wouldn't include private institutions like harvard, it would be more for public institutions like say the university of michigan, and schools like that.
So with this in mind we have three arguments.
First is the idea of education as a right.
Presumably, countries that already provide secondary education free of charge recognize that people have a fundamental right to education.
We think it is arbitrary for there to be a line in the sand at age eighteen that says before this point you have a right to education, and afterwards you do not.
We think that people have a right to learn the skills they need to succeed in life, and that this is why we educate in the first place.
On top of that, we tell you that education as a right was established in many countries in the early twentieth century when primary schools became free, but over time the educational expectations for citizens have changed.
A secondary education used to be a really high level of education in nineteen hundred, but today it's seen as normal in most countries.
So we think that a similarly high bar would actually be to provide tertiary education to people, and therefore in order to be consistent with the original goals of the secondary education movement, we should also provide free at point of use higher education as well.
And on top of that, if individuals such as children have a right to be educated, you could only facilitate that through the education of others.
You need teachers, you need informed parents in order to best educate the next generation, and we think that you can only access that if people are able to go to college, and obviously many more people can go and get a university or college education if it is subsidized the same way that secondary school is.
Our second point is about the economic impacts of this policy.
Now, it's absolutely true that in the short term, government spending will go up.
I think that when bernie sanders ran for president he said it would cost a few tens of billions of dollars to pay for this in the short term in the united states, so probably less in smaller countries.
We tell you, however, that workers will earn more because they'll be able to be more productive and they'll be more specialized.
We tell you that people who are more educated are able to use different techniques to achieve more in the workplace and also that their higher education allows them to fill jobs that otherwise would go empty.
So they can specialize more, and the economy is ultimately much better off.
We tell you that as these people earn more because they're being more productive, the economy will also grow.
They are earning more because the economy as a whole is getting larger and they're contributing more to it.
This means that more people will pay taxes, people who would, in the status quo, not be working, or not be able to produce very much, so they would actually be receiving money back instead of giving money, would now be paying in taxes, and on top of that, there would be more prosperity for all.
People who cannot work, such as the elderly, children, people who are pregnant for instance, would all actually receive a higher quality of life if the society as a whole is more prosperous and more people are paying in money than there is a greater amount of wealth to share around for everyone in need, so those people would be better off as well.
We think that for this reason even the people who don't go to college will be better off because their social safety net will be better.
With this in mind, investing in highly subsidized higher education seems like an excellent investment.
We think that the return in terms of economic growth will be greater than almost any other investment that a government could make.
Our last argument is about the social impact of this highly subsidized education.
We think that people who go to university are better able to be informed voters because they have a better understanding of the history that surrounds events, and also things like critical reading and critical writing, and in general have more access to information than people with only a secondary education.
We therefore think that they will make more intelligent decisions when they vote, so we'll have better government.
We also think that they're likely to be better citizens because we can encourage more civic education, and because they'll be better able to appreciate the importance of their civic duties.
Because of this, we think that ultimately everyone will be better off in society.
And lastly, we think that you'll have a more equal society if you offer this type of free education, because even low income or disempowered people will be more able to access higher education now, so at the end of the day this will be less of a privilege of the elite and more accessible to everybody.
For these reasons, I am proud to suggest that we should subsidize higher education."
"We should make high school mandatory because the skills that you learn in high school and especially in the last couple of years of high school are incredibly critical skills for your future life.
So I think that there is like two main ways you can break this down.
Because the status quo is obviously you're required to go to high school up until a certain point, I believe like your junior or your senior year you can drop out.
So the real comparative is like going to high school for like two years or like three years versus completing high school.
So there's a couple of obvious distinctions here that are really important: the first one is that if you're going to high school for the full amount of time you're getting your degree.
And when you get the degree, that comes with a lot of benefits that are really important to you and important to society.
When you get your high school diploma, as opposed to just simply going to high school in taking the classes, the diploma has value because it signals to prospective employers and people that you've like reached a certain educational level, and not just that you possess like a like assortment of skills in various fields or anything, but like that you have an overall educational capability which can be important to a lot of employers.
But beyond that kind of like softer requirement, a lot of employers just straight up require that you have a high school diploma.
So if you don't have a high school diploma you're already going to be by and large unemployable, and that's incredibly important to the government.
Because if you're unemployable you may end up being reliant on things like medicaid or food stamps or unemployment benefits, a lot of government services.
So the government has like pay a lot may might have to pay money if you're not able to find a job.
So given that there certainly a a direct public interest in that in that sense to try to make sure that people are more employable and people are going to be more heavily employed.
But moreover, a lot of employers, even if you're like in some kind of vocational field, still require you to get a high school diploma because it seen as some kind of educational attainment.
The next thing that I think makes it important to have a high school diploma is less so like the to have mandatory high school, is less the diploma itself, more the skills that you learn.
In the last two years of high school you're often learning incredibly important skills that can be useful for your life.
Oftentimes it's your first exposure to say economics classes.
You learn about things like economics, you may learn because throughout your entire educational career you've been building up a lot of skills.
Maybe you can also take more advanced science classes or more advanced history classes, more specialized classes.
So those final two years of high school can additionally afford you a lot of opportunities to take more specialized classes and that could be useful no matter what career going into.
Because high schools still generally have a good assortment of classes.
So you're going to be able to like learn more skills.
That means that you're going to probably be like a better informed and a better educated citizen, which can have its own benefits for like your individual life and the like society as a whole as well.
But it also means that your like employment prospects are going to be better, your better able to like live independently, there's a whole lot of really good skills that are associated with a high school diploma.
With graduating high school.
The final thing that I want to talk about is that it has in a lot of ways limited cost.
The main argument that would be against like mandatory high school diploma is: "" oh well then you can't live work a job. ""
Or something like that.
Well first, a lot of people do work jobs while they're in high school.
But secondarily your options are gonna be so limited anyway without a high school diploma that it makes more sense to have for the rest of your life those higher earnings that come with graduating from high school.
So for all those reasons we should have mandatory high school."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban partial abortions.
Some modeling, we think that partial abortions are still legal on our side of the house when the mom's life is in danger if they do not have that abortion.
The only time in which you would be banning partial abortions is when everyone's health is completely fine and the fetus is healthy and this is only being done because of a desire on the part of the mother to no longer have a child.
Three main areas of clash.
The first on the moral line.
We think that it is perfectly alright to abort a child that is not yet a child.
During the first through early second trimester the baby is nothing but a clump of cells.
It cannot feel, it is still likely to self abort, etcetera.
But at the point of partial birth, the fetus is human shaped.
It can feel and it can move and it engages in extensive communication with the mother in order to continue existing.
Difference between the complicated organism and the single celled organism is exactly the difference that we're talking about.
The fetus after like after the first and second trimester is a more complex and higher level of life that ought to be protected, insofar as it is no longer just the potentiality of a clump of cells but rather is actually the like the conception of the human being that it will become.
Moreover at this point, the mother has already had a chance to abort.
In fact, they've had months to to to contemplate that decision and clearly she had already decided to keep the child for one reason or another.
So thus it's now too late.
We also think that it's important to note that the mother still has other options at this point.
It is not as though they are completely the child after birth they can still choose to give that child up for adoption, choose not choose to like give them to the other parent if they so wanted, etcetera, etcetera.
The point is that so late in the term you can no longer automatically place the mother's rights above the child's because this child is no longer a lower-level of being.
You have to weigh between higher and lower-order pain.
Sure, the mother might experience some discomfort because she has to carry out this baby to term but this child will literally not be able to live the rest of its life because of this decision and we think that's always going to be more important when you're dealing with an actual life.
Our second area of clash has to do with why this is a poor incentive structure.
We want women to abort as early as possible, if that's what they want because this is the world in which not only do you get less backlash from conservatives but you're also going to have a like safer process both for the mother and the fetus and you're going to like have a cheaper process for the hospital and for the economy.
Understanding this, we shouldn't provide a world in which you can push this decision for as long as possible because of all the reasons I listed above, that it is actively worse personally and for like the hospital if you're going to wait for a very long time.
Our third area of clash has to do with politics.
Currently you already see major ad campaigns on the part of conservatives that paint small baby small fetuses as these helpless things and these liberals are just crushing them and killing them.
We think that when you provide them with actual images of children being dissected you give them the opportunity to further vilianize liberals and abortions by now putting these pictures out there and saying look in the behavior that is actually being engaged in.
This further threatens abortion as a broader institution because if you can convince people that this is what is happening the most often when people are much less likely to support this institution.
Realize that even hardcore liberals often tend to be against such extreme imagery.
It's really easy to be liberal until all of your empathetic strings are being tugged.
When you see images of children being dissected, when you are told that this is the majority of the situation, it becomes a recruitment point and more people will feel will feel bad for these children and less bad for these mothers.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should lower the drinking age.
Some modeling: currently in the united states the drinking age is twenty-one years old, we would lower it to fifteen.
We would maintain the age of purchasing alcohol at at eighteen years old, but we would lower the age of consumption to fifteen.
With that, two main areas of clash: first, on decreasing glamorization, because currently alcohol is massively touted in society as this glamorous things that those who are overworked, those who are overtired, those who are depressed, and those who are partiers and cool people, are going to consume in order to maintain their personas.
Because of this, you often get individuals with incredibly weird ways of conceptualizing alcohol and the way that it affects the body, because rather than recognizing all the problematic aspects about alcohol, like the way that it damages your brain or your liver or causes addictive tendencies, they only see that glamorous aspect that says that if they drink, they're going to be adults and cool.
As such, in the status quo, you get massive amounts of youth drinking alcohol in order to seem adult or party or because they're peer pressured into it.
This is really bad because they hide it from adults who can help.
They tend to drink too much and since they don't know how to drink or how to stay safe, they often end up in very dangerous situations.
It's also bad because, in the status quo, you have a lot of underage drinking, but when something goes wrong, they can't call the cops because it's illegal, or they're too afraid to because of that legality and they're afraid of getting in trouble.
This literally costs people lives when, instead of calling the doctor for when your friend gets alcohol poisoning and is throwing up everywhere, you let them choke on their own vomit.
We also think that you're more likely to feel pressured because it seems like everyone is doing it and it's so cool.
But if you have a healthy relationship with alcohol that can start a lot younger, you're much more likely to see through the lies and like that clouded judgment of your teenage brain, and you're going to see that not everybody is drinking, and there are safe ways to do so, and it's not necessarily a good thing to over-excess drink.
And so we think the only way you start decreasing that glamorization and that stigma is by allowing people to enter that world when they still have parents around them, and they still have adults around them, and rather than avoiding talking to them, they just turn away from them and instead, on our side of the house, they're actually going to discuss the issues that they have.
This brings us to our second area of clash which is about creating safer drinking habits.
Because the current because of the current drinking age, people usually get their first experience in college, either because this is when they turn twenty-one or because this is when their parents aren't looking the most, and this is when they can like start uncontrollably raging and getting really, really drunk.
But this is really bad, because they tend to drink too much around people who can't take care of them.
Because they don't actually have any prior experiences, they can't conceptualize what their limits are, and so they're just going to drink as much as possible, but also because it's been taboo for so long, they feel like they have to over-consume in order to make up for that lost time to a point.
And so with lower drinking age, we think that that first experience can occur safely in the house, with parents who can discuss and help you and talk about what those limits might look like and that way, by the time they get to college, they already have a frame of reference from which they can say, "" okay, this is how much I need to get drunk, this is how drunk I want to be.
I can say no if I want to, "" and other things like that.
We also think you create safer drinking habits because when you legalize it, even when you're young, you're much more capable of calling the cops because you're not afraid that you're going to get in trouble for it, and even if your parents might yell at you a bit, they can't like they they know that it's legal and therefore they can't get as upset as they can on our side of the house.
So we actually think you get a safer drinking habit that way as well because you're actually going to be able to ask for help.
We also think that the earlier that you're exposed, the sooner you can start feeling like you don't need to depend on it and the more you can get guidance through the process, because on their side of the house, you're just going to have college students encouraging each other.
On our side of the house, you at least get a like moment of reason in which your parents says you don't need to have that much, you can like access the same results with less.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should disband NATO.
Three main areas of clash, first on how it has outlived its purpose.
Recognize that NATO was created to defend europe from russia during the cold war but the cold war is gone now and NATO is still somehow there.
This is bad because it creates unnecessary tension and animosity between russia and countries within the NATO alliance especially the US at a time when we think that this tension ought be alleviated and these countries should be working together in like the shared act of globalization.
We think that it prevents meaningful cooperation and easing of tensions when there's always going to be a treaty that russia sees as explicitly against it exclusionary of it and a mandate on whether or not it is a good country.
It like they see it as a threat to their hegemony and provides an incentive for russia to escalate even small conflicts in order to show that it is somehow bigger and better than other states.
We think that what NATO does is makes every conflict that russia has on its border with ukraine a principled stance the against what NATO means.
It also has become vastly expansionist in terms of the US influence into the east it mimics a lot of resource extraction that we see that china does in that it like profits massively from arms sales to new members that it recruits from eastern nations.
It's also used as a venue for US interests and policies a lot of a lot of secret armies that were supposedly for the preservation of democracy or for support for smaller nations actually ended up being intelligence operations for many years and this is something that has like vastly made countries distrust the US more but has also made it not actually like a bearer of true democracy rather just an enforcer of the US will on other smaller countries.
So we think that insofar as it like belays sovereignty that is also something that is bad.
Our second area of clash is about obligations.
I think there are a lot of like different things that are required by NATO that are really problematic at what they do for the outside world.
First one of the requirements of NATO is that countries have to have strong militaries that are capable of defending their neighbors.
This requires participating states to have developed militaries and it's bad because militaries pose threats to other countries which forces them to militarize in response.
So like countries might militarize originally because they're in NATO but then when countries that might be afraid of them on their border see them as a threat they have to militarize in response which necessarily creates tension and also makes any kind of conflict infinitely more likely to be exacerbated.
We thibk that at the end of the day, there are always two avenues that individual countries can take when there is a tense situation either they can have a violent response or they can have a diplomatic interaction.
The problem is when you have a like fully mobilized military and you think that you can win and that military acts first because it's scared of the other one's military, you're always precluding diplomacy and removing the incentive to have it because countries don't want to appear weak or leave openings for other countries to attack.
So we think whenever NATO exists you're always going to have more violent reactions and always have domino effects which actually brings us to like our second area of clash under this which is about creating the domino effect.
The other requirement of NATO is that all states are required to step in on each other's behalf should they be existentially threatened.
This means that small conflicts risk becoming world wars because because if one country is attacked, five more have to come to its to its help and all of the enemies of that country now have to help others and this creates an infinite effect of like allies helping allies as we saw in world war two.
We think that like requiring states to protect others or sorry world war one we think that requiring states to like come in after each other makes it really easy for non-state actors to stage attacks that look like states and create domino effects even when like actual states didn't take action because no one's actually pausing for long enough to think about what really happened.
We also think that it requires states to protect others at cost of their own citizens.
Soldiers die in conflicts between other states on behalf of other states which is bad because states should always fulfill obligations to their own citizens first due to things like the social contract.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"We should ban human cloning.
So by this we mean that all nations around the world should forbid human cloning for any purpose.
We're not going to make a distinction between so-called therapeutic and reproductive cloning in this debate.
We think that any cloning of a human being ought be illegal in every country around the world.
So, two arguments for why we think this is the case.
The first is that we think that it would be deeply unethical to clone another human being because of the effect it would have on the clone once produced.
Imagine the person that you create when you clone a human being.
You create a person who has no mother, no father.
Someone who has no family, no place where they belong in society, presumably they're going to be raised by the state or by these scientists who have treated them.
So we think it's very very improbable that this person will ever have a happy, fulfilling, normal life.
Ordinarily, society goes to great lengths to facilitate children having happy, normal lives so that they can go on to become productive citizens.
We see that the state spends a great deal of money facilitating adoptions to loving homes for instance, and a great deal of money removing children from unhappy homes.
So what happens when you have this cloned child who belongs to say, I don't know, the university of michigan who is being raised by a team of scientists, who presumably does not receive the same kind of nurturing and love that a child being raised elsewhere would.
You're creating someone who, in the best case, lives in some version of foster care and in the worst case is treated like a lab rat.
We think that this is deeply troubling and completely unfair.
This clone child is no less deserving of an ordinary, happy life than any other human being.
They're a human, they have a soul like anyone else, but we think it's improbable that they will ever be provided with these opportunities.
We also tell you that it's deeply troubling that you give private corporations or universities the ability to effectively create people for their own ends.
We think that once you allow cloning, it's likely that companies are going to clone people with certain traits in order to examine their genome.
Say, you'll have people created for a very specific research purpose.
We think that this is likely to lead those people to have severe psychological issues once they're old enough to understand that they were effectively created like a lab rat who's bread to have brown fur.
We don't think that it's acceptable to put anyone, particularly an innocent child, into this situation.
So we ought ban cloning because it is clearly not in the interest of these hypothetical, cloned children.
Our second argument is about the legal difficulties behind permitting human cloning.
Ordinarily, a child's next of kin have a certain legal obligation to that child.
In some countries it might only be the parents, in other countries this obligation might extend past the parents to other close relatives, but we see that no one has a legal obligation to the clone.
At least that's what it seems to me since they don't have a mother or father the way that another person would.
So does, to use my earlier example, the university of michigan have an obligation to feed and clothe this child?
We think that it's very impersonal to assert that that's the case, and we think that it's very like that you would end up with cloned children who don't have clear legal guardians that they would follow in the guardianship of the state, which is obviously something that we want to avoid because of both the expense to the public and also the way that it affects the child.
But I also think it's troubling in terms of the relationship of the cloned child to the cell donor because recognize, you know if someone was making clone of a person, maybe they would take one of my skin cells and grow it into a new clone.
What is the clone's relationship to me at that point?
We think that this is very unclear and that there's no satisfactory resolution to this.
Do I have the same obligation as a father or do I have no obligation?
Because it is unfair to the clone first of all and secondarily because of legal difficulties, we should ban human cloning.
Thank you."
"Surrogacy should be banned.
When a woman gets pregnant it's one of the most dramatic things that her body can undergo in her entire life, impacting her hormones, her ability to sleep, her ability to eat, the medicine that she takes, her ability to work and almost every factor of her life during that time, and it only gets more dramatic pregnancy goes on.
I think that this is dramatically coercive system in which women are paid to bear children, without entirely knowing the risks that they can take on, and once they do, having no ability to opt out of this system because they cannot abort the child nor can they reverse the fact that they're pregnant.
So this is what I'm going to talk about: why the systems are so coercive and why in this instance the government should step in and ban surrogacy contracts.
So, why is this unique from any other system that is coercive on individuals?
We think that individuals should not be able to give away their autonomy or their bodily autonomy into the future.
We don't think that individuals are good at understanding that , understanding the impacts of their present actions on their future self and the amount of pain or pleasure that their actions may have on them in the future which is why we don't think that people should be able to have contracts that sell themselves into slavery no matter how desperate they may be for money.
It's because there's no way to undo something once you've given up your ability to choose for yourself or to have your own bodily autonomy and therefore those contracts can't be outdone undone.
Unlike say, if you accept a job, you're able to undo the fact that you accepted a job you don't like or one that doesn't fulfill what you need in your life by simply quitting the job.
It might be something that you don't want to do, but unlike a pregnancy which is what happens under surrogacy contracts, there's no way to reverse that other than breaking the contract in a way that harms the fetus and harms the people that were relying on you once you had that child.
More importantly, we think that these contracts often target the most underprivileged women.
Women that otherwise wouldn't be able to feed themselves, feed their families, keep them keep a roof over their heads.
People that are most desperate society are the ones that are most likely to take these contracts because one, they're often the most misinformed about what actually happens during pregnancy or what might happen to one's body, what the cost of that might be long term after even after the pregnancy is done, and two, they're the group most likely to accept this sort of drastic action in favor of getting this money.
We think that this is an especially coercive system that is simply a means for people to utilize women who are in the lower classes in order to avoid having a pregnancy themselves, or in some cases allowing a person to arr, allowing a gay couple or a lesbian couple to adopt.
Now, that is something that's important is that these people should also be able to have children , for themselves.
The issue here is that we think that perfectly viable options such as adoption exist that allow people to have children and also allow people to remove the suffering that people who are in need of adoption face.
Adoptees are often the people that have the least access to education, to toys, to a good upbringing, to a childhood that is one that can set them up for future success, and when one adopts rather than goes through a surrogacy, you don't bring a new life into the world but rather you ensure that a life that's already in the world is able to receive loving parents and opportunities in the future.
So given that individuals who couldn't conceive on their own have the perfectly viable alternative of adoption, it's unfair to women for women to be coerced into this system for often less money than it's truly worth their time in their effort and the amount of medical expenses that they go through.
When there's a perfectly reasonable trade off such as adoption for individuals that do are desperate to have a child, we think that we shouldn't allow as a government and as a society, for the most vulnerable women in our society to be taken advantage of for the good of those who have other means of achieving these things.
There are other ways for people and women to be given help.
Social welfare exists, other job opportunities exist, but all these things are things you can opt out of where as a surrogacy contract is something that you simply cannot reverse and this is why surrogacy should be banned."
"We should cancel the speed limit.
We think that something that is widely held to be true, but is simply not backed up by scientific evidence, is that if you drive at a faster speed, you are more likely to get into an accident.
We know that this is not the correlation that actually shows whether or not someone's going to get into an accident, but that other factors lead to a much higher likelihood of accidents than this.
So, that's what we're going to talk about in this round.
We're going to explain why speed is not the determiner of accidents, and then we're going to explain why nobody obeys the law anyway and why it's a bad law to have, because of the outcomes of having such a law.
So, firstly, why do people actually get into accidents?
Studies have shown that it is not the speed that someone is driving at but rather the variance in speed between different people on the highway, that if many different people are driving at many different speeds, you're much more likely to get into an accident.
And, if you have to vary your speed dramatically, for example, if you're going to a part of a highway that goes from a fifty mile per hour speed limit to a thirty-five mile per hour speed limit, these are areas where you're much more likely to get into an accident, because those around you are driving at dramatically different speeds.
Having a system in which instead of having designated speed limits for entire highways, you had a system in which people could drive as fast as they want to drive, however fast that was, but they had to move further into the left if they were going to go above a certain speed, that is a system that is more likely to alleviate accidents, because it ensures that all people within the same lane are driving at approximately similar speeds.
This is a system that is much more likely to lead to fewer accidents in the long run than having one in which people are distracted by speed limits, distracted by the variance in driving caused by speed limits and, in the status quo, often disobey the law anyway.
So, why does it matter that people disobey speed limit laws?
Why is this a reason that we should abolish these laws to begin with?
So, what speed limit laws end up doing in the status quo is they are a way for the government to raise funds and a way for the government to levy taxes in addition to the taxes they levy generally through fines.
People broadly don't obey the speed limit and in doing so, don't cause any more accidents than those that do obey the speed limit.
We think that the government shouldn't shouldn't set up a law that is specifically meant to simply fine people for taking a behavior when that behavior in and of itself does not have any negative externalities.
All that this does is assess taxes onto people that they weren't prepared to pay, which means it can have dramatic impacts on their quality of life and their ability to feed themselves from month to month, from week to week, especially when they didn't prepare to pay those taxes in the first place.
And, if they aren't able to pay a speeding ticket, if they aren't able to do these things, they could have their license suspended, they could have a variety of different harms levied against them, and they could ultimately have to pay much higher fees to appear in court and defend themselves.
All of these are reasons why we don't think that the speed limit should exist, because the fine that is associated with the speed limit is an incredibly detrimental one to any individual, especially people that are more impoverished than the average person, and because speed limit laws don't set up the types of protections that justify these types of harsh punishments.
Finally, we think that speed limit laws end up making people more distracted, because when people are on the road, they have to focus on ensuring that while they're speeding, which they are inevitably going to do, that they aren't doing so in front of a cop, around someone that may pull them over.
All of this leads to more distracted driving which, again, has a higher correlation to accidents than the actual speed you're going.
For these reasons, we should cancel the speed limit."
"We should ban extreme sports.
So by this we mean we think that the governments of liberal countries should close down things like the x games and other organizers of extreme sports.
They should ban youth participation, and they should limit or ban the sale of equipment for these types of sports.
And by extreme sports we mean, broadly speaking sports that present extreme risk to participants and are not part of traditional sporting activities.
So something like parkour in some parts of the world might count as an example of this.
So with that said, two big arguments.
The first is about the need for state intervention.
I think that the most important question for a debate like this is should the government intervene to prevent the behavior that's going on.
So we're going to set up two reasons for why we think there's a need for state intervention.
The first is about an asymmetry of access to information between the people participating in the sport, and the big businesses that are profiting from promoting and selling equipment for the sport.
Extreme sports generally pander to a much younger audience than traditional sports, like soccer or baseball.
We see that young people have less experience in life and less ability to make decisions about whether or not something is actually a good way for them to spend their time, or to get risk, because they have less experience and haven't been exposed to the same types of things that other people have.
So because these sports prey uniquely on young people and encourage them to participate in very risky activities that older people might recognize are not a good idea, we think that there is a certain amount of abuse taking place here, where you have older people taking advantage of young people's lack of knowledge and information, in order to sell them products that ultimately put them at risk.
We think that this there is a power imbalance here between the promoters and the consumers, and that the government is the natural actor to step in to level this power imbalance, because the government has the interest of young people at heart, because they're citizens, and can actually step in to help them.
We think that there are also harms to third parties because of extreme sports.
If you think about the families of these athletes when they become injured who have to care for them, and the burden on health care systems.
We think that ultimately it's not as though the only person being harmed is the person participating in the sport, this actually affects many more people than just them.
Therefore we think the state ought to step in to protect the interest of those people who also deserve consideration by the government.
Our second argument is about why we think that this is bad for sporting culture or why we think extreme sports are bad for sporting culture.
So first of all, pretty much all extreme sports are individual events that don't focus on like teamwork, or working with a coach in a way that traditional sports do.
The other team might get up here and say, oh well, singles tennis doesn't promote teamwork either, but at least then you actually are working with a team of people to improve, you're probably training with a team at your university or your school, and you have a coach.
So we think that that actually does promote teamwork, even if it's not necessarily a team event.
Whereas because extreme sports tend to not be organized on a university level because they're too dangerous, or on a school level, things like that, ultimately you're not going to be working with a team of people to improve, it's very individual.
And we think that one of the biggest benefits that sports offer to young people is to teach them how to be part of a team, how to be a leader, how to work with other people that they don't get along with, and ultimately you lose out in all these benefits.
And because most people have a limited time to devote to sporting activity, we think that there is a tradeoff here, you're going to have fewer people doing traditional sports that have all of these benefits if more people are doing extreme sports as a result.
We also tell you that this is probably going to lead to a lesser quality of competition in things like collegiate leagues and international athletics as well.
We think that if more of our best athletes are going into extreme sports, one they're simply not competing for things like the olympics or like the world cup or international leagues, but on top of that more of our best athletes in the country are being tragically injured at a young age.
So even if governments traditionally don't involve themselves to?
Heavily in sports, clearly they do have an interest in protecting their best athletes to represent them on the international stage, and also protecting young people who are being taken advantage of.
So for these reasons we should ban extreme sports."
"We should prohibit corporal punishment.
So in this debate we're saying that in schools, in the army, in the criminal justice system, we should not allow the use of physical punishment in order to cause pain to change people's behavior.
And we think this debate is applicable in basically every country around the world because our arguments are based more on principle than any one countries legal system.
So three arguments for our side.
First, we think that physical punishment is unethical.
Why is this so?
We think that in order for an action to be ethical or moral it needs to be universalizable.
In other words it is unethical to lie to people because while sometimes, individual lies may have good ends, you know if you tell your mom that she looks nice in an ugly sweater, maybe that has a good end.
But if everyone lied all the time than society couldn't function.
We couldn't do business or have contracts.
So we think lying is unethical because it's not universalizable.
Whereas something like telling the truth virtually always will have good ends.
So what we tell you is that corporal punishment is not universalizable because while it may be true that spanking unruly child will cause them to work harder in school or something like that.
In general, there are many times when using this violence would be completely unacceptable, such as punishing someone arbitrarily or beating someone for saying something that you don't like, etcetera.
We think that because this behavior isn't universalizable that it's unethical.
And that generally speaking, the law should seek to prohibit unethical conduct.
We see this is true, we punish unethical behavior in many professions.
I don't see why it should be different in education or in the military or the criminal justice system.
Our second argument is that corporal punishment leads to harmful societal norms.
When people grow up expecting that physical force is going to be the main deterrent against doing something wrong, they're less receptive to other deterrents.
People are less likely to do the right thing because it is the right thing if they grow up knowing that they're going to be hit for doing the wrong thing.
That creates an incentive for people to lie, cheat, steal, whatever it may be and try to get away with it to avoid the punishment.
Why is this true?
If you grow up in a society that tells you to feel guilty for doing the wrong thing, where punishments are based on access to privileges and things like that, we tell you that you're likely to have an intrinsic motivation to do the right thing.
Conversely if your motivator as a child to do the right thing is to avoid getting hit, we think it's very likely that you'll have an extrinsic motivation to do the right thing.
And at that point there's no reason not to do bad things if you know you can get away with them.
So ultimately we think that prohibiting corporal punishment will lead to more people having an intrinsic motivation to do the right thing which will actually lead to less crime, less antisocial behavior, then corporal punishment and it extrinsic motivation.
Our third and final argument is that violence begets violence.
If you raise young people to say, look your mom is bigger than you and she's going to hit you if you do bad things, then you're encouraging them to do the same elsewhere in their lives.
Studies have shown that boys who are beaten as children are more likely to beat their wives, and why wouldn't they be?
If you grow up being told that when someone does something that is wrong or bad, you hit them, then why wouldn't you expect those boys to grow up and then beat their wives if they do something they don't like?
So we think that many societal ills are caused by creating a culture of violence, especially for children.
And this extends to the military as well.
If you treat people very harshly during their military training, can you really be surprised if they treat civilians of an enemy country very harshly?
I think there's a reason why the red army treated german civilians so differently than the american army, and part of that is the harshness of discipline that was faced on the two sides respectively.
So at the end of the day we should prohibit corporal punishment because it's unethical, because it creates harmful norms, and because violence begets violence.
Thank you."
"Marriage is outdated.
I can't think of anything more personal than a relationship between two people.
It is their own private business, not society's and surely not the states.
Marriage are an outdated social construct that no longer fits today's modern society, as the amount of divorces can attest to, as the fact that more and more young couples are seeking alternatives can attest to.
What we're going to do in this speech is discuss two of the most common rationales for the existence of marriage today and explain why they're no longer relevant.
Those rationales are: a, marriage is an artificial barrier from breaking up, and b, marriage are needed to defend the weaker side.
What we won't be discussing is the religious rationale, simply because we think that if two people are religious and they believe that the lord commands this particular ceremony, that it represents their holy and sacred bond or whatever, then we can't really argue with that.
But we think that this isn't what's going through the minds of most married people, so we'll focus on the more common rationales.
So firstly, marriage is an artificial barrier from breaking up.
The idea is basically that people are rash and don't always make the right choices.
What we want is to make sure that if two people decide to separate, then they had to think it over long and hard, and so we're setting artificial barriers in order to discourage them from doing this without proper thought because otherwise, people will just run off to break up and , you know, too easily with the first sign of difficulty and so on.
So society's solution was to have all of your friends and family come and witness you swear to stay together forever.
This raises the bar of embarrassment, that's one artificial barrier.
Another is the legal hardship.
Another is the financial hardship.
All of these things are meant to make it harder for you to break up.
Now why don't we agree with this concept?
Well our answer is threefold.
A: we think it's extremely paternalistic to assume that people can't reach the right decision by themselves on the most private thing that they have in their lives.
We don't think it's society's business, and even if it is the wrong decision for me and I'll get hurt by it, it should be my decision to make, and I shouldn't be considering anyone else's interests in the matter.
B: we think that there are so many natural barriers and obstacles to breaking up that it would be it wouldn't be more efficient to add further barriers.
This is this just makes the lives of whoever does decide to separate much much harder.
Natural barriers, such as the heartache for one, the insecurity of returning to the dating world.
When you live together, there are obviously financial considerations that act as obstacles and, of course, of course, having children which are the most like major barrier from simply separating.
C: if after all of this all of this, people still decide they want to break up, then it probably means that they should that they should break up.
We think it's horrible if the only thing that keeps two people together is that it would be too much of a headache to separate or that it would cost too much money.
But the fact is that in most cases, it doesn't even work, and we can see that the divorce rate is ever-rising.
People still break up.
This isn't what scares them, this just makes their lives more miserable for years on after.
This shouldn't be like it shouldn't be this way.
Second rationale that we're going to answer to is marriage is a defender of the weaker side.
So this argument looks at the legal side of marriage as a contract that's meant for the moment in which the couple decides to separate.
The idea is to like to distribute the property in a fair way that doesn't screw over one side.
Many times both parties don't earn the same amount of money, and most times it's specifically the woman that stays at home and did all of the houseworks and so on, but we tend to rightfully look at the property of the husband and the wife as the product of a mutual like mutual effort.
In order for there to for there not to be one party that gets to keep all the wealth and another that gets none of it after a breakup, we have marriage.
Why is this no longer valid logic?
A: today there are more and more cases of a prenuptial agreement that completely nullify this logic, but b: we think that this is an important thing but we just don't need the actual act of marriage in order for this to happen.
People can still go to court upon separation, and the court can still examine, as is the as is the case today, whether there was actually a mutual effort and decide how to split up the resources, and we can do all of this without the title of being married.
So, because it's stupid to add artificial barriers to breaking up and because it's not really necessary in defending the weaker side, please propose."
"Urbanization does more harm than good for two big reasons.
First, because urbanization result in a worse quality of life, and second, because urbanization leads to people being worse off economically.
Before I get into the meat of these two arguments though, I want to first talk about the broad ability to apply these arguments more broadly.
Because I think that as much as a lot of the things about quality of life concerns and cost concerns are prevalent in developed countries around the world, when you see I think that these problems are oftentimes magnified in developing countries.
So, now that we've talked about that, let's talk about why there's going to be a worse quality of life for people.
I think the first reason why there's going to be worse quality of life is on the matter of health.
When you look at the health of people, it's oftentimes worse in concentrated urban populations, and there's a few reasons for this.
First and foremost, sanitation tends to be worse and more difficult in these circumstances.
This is obviously true in a lot of developing countries around the world that don't have the money or the infrastructure in place to actually lead to a lot of like clean public health spaces.
But this is generally true of a lot of cities in developed parts of the world too, like places like america.
You're more likely going to see higher concentrations of people that could lead to diseases spreading more rapidly, it becomes harder to dispose of things like waste efficiently and the like, more like vermin and other kinds of like or like mosquitoes, all the kinds of things that feed off of like human droppings or waste, all of these things are more likely to grow there, there's more places for a lot of these kind of things to hide in like to nooks and crannies of various things like .
There is a whole lot of like safety issues that could be concern for people, and this can have impacts on people.
There's also problems of like more concentrated pollution that can lead to longer term health problems, because quality of air tends to be worse when you're at lower higher concentrations of a population.
It's honestly in a lot of ways an endless list of reasons, and this is incredibly important because a lot of these problems are a whole lot less more severe when you don't have all this density.
It's unique to the density in a lot of ways, why you get all these health problems, and that's incredibly important.
That comes with a financial cost, but it comes with like ability of someone to live their life for a longer period of time.
People aren't going to be able to enjoy life as much either.
I also think that there is the secondary of concern under quality of life is more safety, it is safety concerns.
I think that there is also safety problems because you're more likely to see higher rates of violence or higher rates of crime when you're in more densely populated areas.
So that's also something that would be bad and expanded with more urbanization.
Additionally, I also think that there is a lot of like physiological and psychological elements that make living in a city worse off for you.
Your first and foremost, because of things like gridlock and traffic and the like, you're more likely going to have a longer commutes, you're probably going to get less sleep, you're probably going to have less access to green spaces and parks, other sources of recreation or at least it'll be more difficult to access.
And all of these things obviously can have heart health effects, if you get less sleep you're less likely to be healthy.
But they're also not always good for you psychologically.
You feel oftentimes more stressed, you feel like you're less able to relax effectively, that the amount of time that you're working feels longer.
All of these things are bad.
But there's also economic concerns to worry about, and that's the second thing I want to talk about.
I think that there is a reason why you look at rent costs in places like new york or san francisco, they're necessarily much higher than in the they're necessarily a lot higher.
And the reason for this is because people keep moving to cities under the promise of more jobs, but the rate at which you're able to create job is never going to be enough to satiate this demand.
So what you ultimately get is you get an over-saturation of the markets that are involved in this.
You're going to see people keep moving and moving into cities because of the promise of more jobs, but all this does is it increases the demand for rent for housing, and it increases the demand for goods and services and all of these other kinds of things.
This is why the average cost of living is oftentimes more expensive in cities, and this creates huge financial consequences for a whole lot of people.
So for all those reasons, urbanization does more harm than good."
"I'm proud to stand proposition of today's motion, that we should abandon big government.
I think a little bit vague, but there are three conceptions I see of what this motion means, and I'm going to defend all three of them.
First, that libertarianism is an ideal that we should embrace within our governmental structures, secondly, that we should delegate authority to the most local forms of government and generally municipalities or states, if that's not possible, and thirdly that red tape is bad.
So on the first of these conceptions, that libertarianism is something we should pursue in public policy.
The basis of this is that autonomy on an individual level is a good thing.
It is the most fundamental right that we have, and is the reason why we care about our other rights, things like our right to life we care about, because when we are alive, that enables us to make decisions that allow us to pursue a path that we pine to be utile, right?
Like, we maximize this when possible, it is the most basic thing that we care about is freedom.
So, why do we maximize this when possible, and at the governmental level?
Two reasons, first is that people on an individual level know what's best for them.
The goal of the government at a large level is just to make people as happy as they can, to decrease suffering and maximize pleasure.
People, on an individual level, though know what will do that for them.
So generally, when there are constraints on their actions, people are less capable of making the decisions that would make them happiest.
But secondly, we would maximize this, simply because it is well within the scope of the motion, to just limit people's freedom, when there are significant third party harms, right?
Like, I don't think big government, or small government rather, means that you can't criminalize murder, or things like that right?
So given that, I think it's totally reasonable to stay within the scope of the world, where in significant third party harms aren't going to be something that we would legalize.
Second independent point is delegating authority to municipal levels.
We should do this for two reasons, first is that the municipal level has a better knowledge of personal need.
So, in the same way that I as an individual know what I want, my municipality is more likely to know what the people living within the municipality would like, rather than the federal government, trying to approximate that for each individual municipality around the country.
So, you have more efficient decision making.
But secondly, it's more democratic, because you don't have the outside influence, that actually , so, for example like, people in one state that don't like a policy, that the majority of the country does, have the ability to regulate their own day to day interactions.
Again, I think we would be fine with delegating authority to higher levels when it is issues like say, interstate trade, that really can't be done on a piecemeal level, but when possible, we should direct decision making down to the most local level, because these are the agencies that are most capable of dealing with these issues head on, and in a way that actually approximates the will of the people that occupy those areas.
Our third third independent point is that red tape is something that is bad.
So, I think two things under this, the first is that generally individual people are pretty good at solving their own issues, right?
Like, generally government subsidies, and things like that, might help to a small extent, but for the large majority of things, there are services you can buy, there are people you can talk to, there are ways that people can figure out their day to day issues.
But secondly is that the problem is that, when you regularly industries to such a significant degree, as exists in the status quo, you create barriers that actually harm people on a day to day basis.
Things like basic important services, like transporting medical goods, which is slowed down by like tight border regulations, things like that, we deem these to be bad, because it creates inefficiencies within markets, and inefficiencies within human interaction, that would be completely eradicated if you didn't have these onerous regulations.
We think a world without those barriers to free action is significantly better, insofar as it decreases human suffering, and allows people to make the best decisions possible for themselves.
Proud to propose."
"We should legalize the growing of coca leaf.
So to be clear in this debate when we legalize the growing of coca leaf, we think what is necessarily going to arise is that more production of cocaine, both crack and powder cocaine, is going to occur and honestly we're just going to say we're going to legalize that as well.
We're gonna legalize the ownership, distribution, use, all these types of things, sale of coca leaf, and the products that come from coca leaf.
So now that that's clear, we have two main arguments.
The first is that the war on drugs is bad and the second is that legalizing coca leaf will lead to an economic boom which is simply worth the risk.
Okay, recognizing the status quo that the war on drugs is simply unjust.
What the war on drugs dictates is that individuals are not allowed to use with their body whatever they see fit.
That means that people are not able to use their bodily autonomy in ways that only only impact their own bodily autonomy, and recognize that you can prohibit the use of you can prohibit people doing things under the influence of drugs, for example, if you're concerned that the use of cocaine will lead to people having impaired driving well then you can prohibit people being able to drive while impaired on coca leaf.
This is what we do with this is what we do with alcohol in the status quo.
We don't see why you can't do it here.
We think that fundamentally a government that restricts the ability for people to do things when what they do has no impact on external sources, has no impact on the society around them, that is fundamentally unjust and coercive in a way that the government needs to rectify.
Moreover, recognize that the criminalization of coca leaf in the status quo is massively discriminatory.
Firstly, where coca leaf is grown is in areas of massive poverty and we think that if coca leaf was allowed to be produced these areas are likely going to be the ones that get a massive economic benefit and it means that even though these people don't live in the united states or in developed nations, these people could get huge economic booms that are simply worthwhile or that could change their life forever.
We also think that we've seen that this band is massively ineffective and that even with a ban on coca leaf people are still using it at a high rate.
It only means that the money that is being drawn from the use of crack and powder cocaine goes to cartels rather than to businesses that can be taxed, which I'll talk about in a second, but clearly we think that when you put money into the cartels all you're going to see is increased violence which leads to de-stability not just in local areas like northern mexico in which cartels have in large part blacked out the government and have taken over control of these regions, but also on a global scale.
When drug violence is at a high and drugs are able to pervade countries without any sort of government oversight.
So we think that what happened in the status quo is that you have a war on drugs that has failed in every sense.
It's also massively discriminatory as shown by the the discrepancy between sentencing for crack and powder cocaine even though crack cocaine and powder cocaine are the exact same chemical substance simply a discrepancy in use between black and white people.
Okay given that the war on drugs has failed and is fundamentally unjust, we think you should focus on the economic boom that comes from it.
Recognize that when you shift that when you legalize coca it allows for legitimate businesses to open up and to run and sell this product.
This leads to a couple of things.
First, it means that these things are just much safer for users because you know that your cocaine isn't being cut with other things that can be much more harmful to you like heroin or other types of drugs and it means that you can tax these businesses which means even if you are amongst the group that believes that people should never be allowed to use cocaine, that having cocaine is a sin and is something that people need to be fundamentally restricted from being able to do, even though it doesn't impact anyone but themselves, we think that what we've seen is that prohibition is an ineffective measure for prevention, but what actually works for prevention is education.
Cocaine we recognize has some negative health effects, can lead to overdose, can lead to death, and can lead to addiction and these things need to be educated into people.
We think though you get better education when you have tax revenue from legitimate sources that you can direct this education rather than funneling millions of dollars into drug prevention and drug arrests and these types of activities.
We don't think that prohibition has worked.
We don't think it'll work in the future and we think that the economic boom that comes with legalizing coca leaf will be more effective in stopping people from using cocaine than prohibition has ever been in the past.
For these reasons we should legalize the growing of coca leaf."
"We should increase local government.
Our model for this is really simple: we just think that you should have larger local governments with more power over regional law and more developed branches and departments.
So, essentially, we just want a lot more money to be going into local law as opposed to federal law, so maybe decrease your federal taxes, put a lot of that money into local governments, and then allow those governments to have more control over the region, up but like clearly maintain similar democratic like checkpoints and similar democratic balances.
Like we don't think this just becomes autocracy, we think we're still governed by democratic principles.
Two main arguments, first on providing personalized government.
Regions within a country tend to differ wildly from each other in their political beliefs and needs.
This is the difference between going from one part of new york to the next, where maybe new york city is like crazy liberal and has all of these needs for like large infrastructure and a lot of like welfare development but versus you go somewhere that's a lot more rural, like northeastern new york, and you end up in areas with a lot of farm country and a lot of farmers who need a completely different treatment than large cities.
And this is like ridiculously common, it's just not new york state.
This happens in states like pennsylvania, in western states, and southern states where you might have city centers right next door to these large, rural, sprawling grounds.
And the problem becomes that when you craft policies higher up than local government, those policies and those federal actions miss the nuance of individual regions and populations, which makes broad policy often inapplicable or not in line with the desires of large swaths of the population.
Democracy is about being representative of the needs of the substituents.
Having more local government is a way to create smaller pockets of democracy that can cater to the areas they have control over, and it means you'll be more representative of the people without coming at the cost of others, because in the status quo, these kinds of interests tend to directly clash.
Like, passing large welfare support oftentimes hurts rural farmers and hurts those areas a lot more than it helps them, because it comes from the money that would have been used maybe for like farming subsidies, and those things trade off.
But when you give that power to local governments and they can more have more choice over how they spend that money, then those kinds of divisions are infinitely less likely to happen, because now you can actually just have regionally dependent like good social policy.
Our second argument is about creating public participation and enthusiasm.
It's a lot easier to become apathetic about the government and its actions if the government is far away and impersonal.
Often, this is what happens in the status quo, because citizens are so distant from the federal government that that controls the majority of their lives that they don't feel like what they do makes a difference in it, and they don't participate on in the government, and they grew disillusioned.
This is what happens when you have like people who are massively affected by healthcare reform, but they feel like they can't actually do anything about it or act in any way, because their vote seems too small, and no one wants to listen, and washington DC might be hours and hours away and just this figment of the imagination, essentially.
And we think that when you personalize that government, when you bring them closer, you can see the impacts of your area's political voices.
You feel more listened to and understood by the government, so you're more likely to participate in it more.
We also just think that you're more likely to have more transparency with larger local governments just because the closeness is more real, and you can have like more direct accountability through your vote because your actual regions selects them, so there's less degrees of separation than you have in the status quo with like everything being in DC and the vote being made up of like literally billions of people versus like maybe it's your area and your local area, and that's made up of like a couple thousand people, and that's more likely to be better for you, which we think is very good.
So at the end of the day, we just think this is the best way in which to both represent the desires of the people and get people more engaged in their government and saying their desires more, both of which are just good for democracy.
Proud to propose."
"Immigration to the united states of america brings more good than harm.
So, in this debate, I think it's critical that we acknowledge that a huge part of immigration to the united states happens, illegally, that lots of people come in with fake papers or they come in from latin america illegally.
We still think though that on balance, immigration is ultimately a good thing.
So, we have two major arguments: the first is that we think immigration drives growth in the united states.
Recognize that the US is able to attract trained workers from around the world at no cost.
So, basically, it takes a lot of resources and money to produce doctors and engineers and all of these other really highly skilled professionals, but those are a lot of the people who want to come to america.
So, the united states is getting really good people from countries like china and india who already have college degrees that we didn't have to pay for.
We're basically getting these really good, well-trained workers for free as a result of immigration and we think that that's an obvious benefit, that we're basically getting brain gain when other countries get brain drain.
We think that this gives the US a competitive advantage relative to other countries and ultimately, is a really driving factor in american success.
But also recognize the type of people who are willing to leave their family, leave their home and move to a new country are probably some of the most ambitious, entrepreneurial people in the world.
We think that if you're lazy or if you're not hard working, you'll never even make it to this country because it's so difficult to go through the process of immigration.
And this is true for illegal as well as legal immigration.
Even if a lot of illegal immigrants, you know, they're not doctors or engineers, they're still hard-working people who were willing to take a big risk in order to get a better life for themselves and their families.
So, we think that that type of person is more likely to start a business, more likely to work three jobs, more likely to do overtime, more likely to take risks once they get here, and that ultimately, that's a really important part of the economy is that people are willing to start a business, people are willing to put in the extra hour.
That's ultimately what has made america so successful in the past relative to other countries.
This is also as another major benefit, the only source of population growth for the US.
So, recognize a lot of highly developed countries like, say, germany, have a shrinking population or a population that's stagnant.
Basically, no one is having kids really, so you have more elderly people and fewer and fewer young people and when this happens, you run into a problem where in the future, there's not going to be enough workers to keep all your businesses going.
Now, the united states is the only highly developed country that's really avoided this problem and it's entirely because of immigration.
Americans, by and large, are having enough children to keep the population about flat.
So, there would be zero growth and then you would probably see a trend towards a decline in population like you have in germany.
But because the US attracts so many immigrants, you actually have population growth and we're able to avoid this problem so, at the end of the day, I think it's clear that immigration fuels the economy and that even undocumented workers, even so called illegal immigrants, are still people who are entrepreneurial and ambitious and that these people are a net benefit to the american economy.
So, our second point is about the cultural benefits: we think that one of the major strengths of the US relative to other countries is it's tremendous diversity.
There's more languages spoken in new york city than any other handful of square miles in the world, for instance.
We think that as a result of this, the US can tap on the resources of lots of different regions around the world.
There's a great sense of cosmopolitanism.
We think that this leads to more cultural tolerance.
Americans are more likely to be accepting of different cultures and different backgrounds if they're actually exposed to them and we think that you see this out within the united states that people in places like new york city and los angeles, who meet immigrants from around the world every day are probably more tolerant than people who never meet those individuals, so we think that ultimately, this promotes tolerance within the US.
But it also promotes an ability to understand other people's cultures.
US intelligence, the US military, etcetera, are able to recruit americans who have a deep understanding of other countries' and regions' cultures because their parents came here from those countries.
So, when we did things like we went into afghanistan and iraq, those may have been poor decisions from a policy perspective, but very least, we had americans who spoke arabic and who spoke farsi and these other languages and we were able to be more successful because of that.
So, we think that ultimately, diversity makes the united states culturally more accepting and also provides a lot of material benefits.
So, for these reasons, we think that immigration to the USA brings more good than harm."
"We should cancel the social security tax and we should cancel it immediately, because it is a rights violation.
And it is a rights violation that has no countervailing justification and it is not legitimized by any actual need for it.
So before I get into that, I want to clarify the grounds of what we're discussing here today.
Because I think that the motion is very clear in that it says we should cancel the social security tax, not cancel the FICA tax, so therefore we're perfectly fine defending the status quo with regards to the FICA tax still existing, although albeit at a likely lower rate, in order to collect money for things like medicare and medicaid.
So now that we've established that, let's talk about why social security is problematic and it the tax needs to be ended.
So obviously the social security tax is rights violating.
It's rights violating in the fact that the money that you earn is the result of your work, it's the result of your labor, and a big reason why the state exists in the first place is to ensure the protection of your property and to enable that, by things like whether contracts or police forces and things like that.
The reason the state exist by and large is to preserve the protection of your property, which means that it probably shouldn't take your money away from you, money that is rightfully yours unless it has a pretty good reason for doing so.
So now let's talk about why we don't think that with regards to the social security tax, there is a pretty good reason for doing so.
So the first reason I don't believe I believe that this is true, is because I don't actually think that you can have a right to social security in no way that you could have rights to other things.
So I'm not going to deny that you should have a right to things like your health, right to things like your safety, a right to things like food and shelter.
However, that's not what social security is about.
Social security is essentially just money that you get, a fund that you get as a result of either being just a retiree, or certain kinds of disabilities, or a widow status or other other extenuating circumstances like that.
But by and large it resolves around simply old age, and I don't think the fact that you are simply old, combined with the simply old, actually necessitates that you have a right to this money.
And the reason I think that's true is because I don't think that you can have a right to money.
You can only have a right to certain things, because those are what ultimately impacts your life.
Maybe if you are a senior citizen and you are struggling to provide yourself with healthcare, then you should have the right to medicare.
If you're a senior citizen who is struggling to be able to provide yourself with food, then the government can exist to offer programs to help you with food, something that you have a right to.
But I don't think that you have a right to anyone else's money just in the form of their money, that you could spend in any way you want whatsoever.
So the next the next reason why we should cancel the social security tax is because I don't actually think there's any need for it, and if there is no need to take money from people, you probably shouldn't do that.
So the first reason why there's no need is because oftentimes there's already either alternatives or supplements to social security anyway, in the forms of individual pension plans that come from a lot of different entities.
Oftentimes companies offer pension plans, most government they offer pension plans, a lot of union workers get pension plans, so a lot of people got pension plans.
But additionally, even if there's no pension plans existing, simply oftentimes by responsible saving and smart investing, you can still ensure that you're going to be able to have a reasonable enough amount of savings so you're able to take care of yourself throughout the duration of your life, something that is honestly in a lot of ways pretty doable.
So for all of those reasons it's quite clear that while there is a clear loss of rights when you're taking away money from people, there's no real reason why you have to do it, because you don't have a right to money, you only have a right to certain benefits that are necessary for your survival maybe, and you also oftentimes have other alternatives to social security that don't make its tax collection necessary, it's not the same thing as like police officers or things like that.
So for all of those reasons, we're incredibly proud to cancel the social security tax."
"Recall elections are beneficial.
In this debate, we're going to be talking about recall election, specifically in the form of individuals, being able to vote to repeal the election of a candidate, while their term is still on.
So, this this usually occurs when people are dissatisfied with the current candidate, that has become their elected official, usually they haven't fulfilled certain campaign promises, things like this, and it leads to there being a recall vote, in which the entire voting population is able to vote as to whether or not the person will be able to keep their term in office, and continue to serve, and if they are recalled, or, if the vote is more than fifty percent, where they are disapproved of, then there's a new election, and a new process to find someone to fill in for that term.
So, we're going to talk, primarily, about why did direct democracy, a direct democracy in this form is good, and why we think we get better political outcomes, which is ultimately the purpose of politics in the first place.
So firstly, on direct democracy.
We think that, recall elections are more principally just within a democratic system.
Within democratic state, within a liberal state, the state can only be justified based on the consent of the people that are governed by, which is why that which is why we have the democratic elections that we have in the first place, it's to ensure that those that are being ruled, are ruled by those to which they have consented to ruling them, unlike the kings and monarchs of the past.
We think that, more actions equals more opportunities to consent, because people don't get the opportunity to vote on day to day legislation, they don't get the the chance to vote on every bill that comes before state house.
It means that, individuals when people elect candidates, it is their proxy for how policy is moving, its their proxy for how policy is done.
We think that, more elections means more opportunity for for people to have the most direct impact on the policy making position.
Elections are a much more concrete way of changing the policy direction, more concrete than giving money or giving donations to candidates, it's more concrete than writing to your legislature, or even having protests.
We think that elections are the most direct, and most essential way to change policy.
Further, we think that when individuals elect a candidate, that candidate runs on certain premises, the premises of campaign promises, of what that candidate intends to do while in office.
At the point, at which the candidate has been unable to fulfill that promise, whether it is their fault or not that this is the case, we think that that is the point at which, the people are capable of making the decision to recall that candidate, because they bought into that candidate on false promises, on false expectations, and as the candidate is simply a proxy for what those people believe should be achieved in a policy sense, when that candidate doesn't fulfill those policies, it means that a new direction is entirely justified by the people.
This is also why we think we get generally better outcomes, when you have recall elections.
There's no objectively correct way, in which the government should run, or in which the state should function.
The state exists to serve the ideas and the priorities of the people in that state, and once the state begin to act in ways that are not beneficial, ways that are possibly corrupt, in ways that benefit themselves, which we think is often the case, when people are put in a position of power, when there are individuals lobbying for them, individuals trying to get their attention, a revolving door that, allows them to get very lucrative jobs, after they've been in office, all these things are reasons why politicians may not have the people's best interests, and often don't have the people's best interest in mind.
We think that, it is unfair to force the populace to continue to deal with a candidate that doesn't represent their ideals, that isn't bringing about the change, or the direction that they want to see, and the opportunity to recall that individual, to at least give the sign that, people are discontent with how the government is running, we think that this is a crucial part of democracy, and leads to people being more accountable to the promises they made, and leads the people more often getting the government they desire.
For these reasons, we believe that recall elections are beneficial."
"We should disband asean.
In the status quo asean is a system of southeast asian nations organizing into a system that allows for economic progress, growth and trade for the whole region.
It allows for unification between the region in making economic and localized decisions.
We think that both the structure and the pragmatic outcomes of what we've seen from asean are not good, and that it should be disbanded because of that.
Firstly, the structural flaws that make even the concept of this type of union problematic in the way that it currently exists.
Firstly, it ties nations to the economic growth of others, which we think especially in developing countries like those in southeast asia is incredibly problematic, firstly, because these developing nations often have the most tumultruous economies, which means that if one nation goes down, it's likely going to drag down the development of other nations, and secondly, it means that you can't have as much specialization and diversity in in and what these countries are doing when they're all following similar labor standards.
But more importantly, the method of making decisions only through consensus in the asean, which means that any big differences and changes that need to be made to political or economic decisions which are likely to occur in an ever changing world that's based on a technological revolution that is changing what the markets look like on a day to day basis, we think that this type of oaky and saturated system in which every country needs to agree on what is best is only going to hold every country back.
It's going to make them less able to adapt to a changing environment, economic environment in the future, and we think that this only makes these countries more vulnerable to exploitation in the long run.
But the second problem is how asean actually behaves, because in the status quo, asean services a front that allows countries to protect themselves from the human rights and labor abuses that exist.
For example, in the status quo, there are massive human rights abuses in places like myanmar and in other countries in southeast asia, for example, a boat was being sent between two different countries in southeast asia that carried refugees from myanmar in recent in recent months, in which no country was willing to take these people, in which no country was willing to take these people in, and every country created this atmosphere and created an environment in which this type of practice was unacceptable.
Further, actual slaughters and human rights abuses, real murders, real harms are occurring to the people in these countries.
The governments of these of many of these countries are dictatorial in nature, and are impressing the people that exists in these regions.
When these countries close each other off from outsiders and allow for themselves to focus within their own economic sector, their own political sector through the asean, it makes these countries less susceptible to the influences of other voices, moderating force such as the united states and the european union, that may be that may help protect people from these human rights abuses in the status quo.
We think that the best way to protect these people is to disband this network that allows for the protection of abuses as they exist in the status quo, and we think that that is incredibly important, that that is the most important because it ensures that people on the ground, the real people that are impacted by the economic policies of asean, are not being harmed in the process.
And finally, on labor.
Labor practices in these countries are are also incredibly problematic, and it makes it, because these are all a regional area, makes it very difficult for labor to move from nation to nation when the labor standards in each country are so deplorable.
When people aren't able to move out of their country and find better labor standards across the across the border, aren't able to move to any reasonable place to find better labor standards, it allows every country to lower its labor standards, which not only harms the people that exist, but also it decreases the level of productivity in these economies, which has a second secondary negative effect on these countries.
Given that the system of asean itself is horribly bloated, and that the impacts only allow for abuses of the people, we think we should disband asean."
"We should prohibit flag burning.
So while I suppose this might be an international issue in some sense, really I think what this debate is about is whether the united states should continue to allow flag burning.
There's been several supreme court cases about this in the US and many states continue to try to ban flag burning, although the supreme court keeps striking it down.
So with that background in mind, we have three arguments for why we should prohibit flag burning, particularly in the US.
First, is about the popular will.
So the US is in a democracy.
The government gains legitimacy by paying attention to the will of the people.
With that in mind it seems completely true that the majority of the american people support a ban on flag burning.
Most americans are quite patriotic, have family members in the military and generally think that flag burning is unacceptable.
It's seen as a sign of anti-american radicalism globally.
When most americans see someone burning a flag, they don't think of principled resistance to some policy of the american government, they think about iranians burning the american flag and shouting for the death of barack obama and things like that.
So the imagery is really negative and the american people have decided that this is something that they think is unacceptable.
We think that since the legitimacy of the government derives from popular will, that american courts should not continue to prevent state and federal government from making these laws banning flag burning.
We think that if anything the fact that people continue to vote for politicians who pass these kind of laws indicates that there is a very strong public will for this and one the supreme court ought respect.
Our second argument is that this is disrespectful to veterans.
So all around the united states there are tens and tens of thousands of people who were injured in the service of their country in various conflicts.
You might say that those conflicts weren't good things in themselves but that doesn't change the fact that the enlisted soldiers who fought in them didn't get us into those wars, they just helped get us out of them.
We think that many of these people feel personally attacked because of flag burning.
I think that when someone knows lots of people who were injured or even killed in the defense of the flag, it seems like a personal affront to them to see the flag being burned.
And I'd like to compare this to the concept of fighting words.
In the US, in some states, there's a principle that you are allowed to defend yourself if someone else does harm to you and that this can include speech if those words are fighting words.
This is kind of loosely defined in the law, but in general it might be something like an insult against your character or your family's character, something like that.
We think that burning the flag is a similar type of speech in a sense.
It is like fighting words against people who served in the military.
And in the same way that we allow reaction against those people, one, by banning fighting words and two, by allowing them to defend themselves we ought ban flag burning.
Our last argument is about why this is consistent with other limitations on freedom of speech, so similar to that.
But I'd also like to point out that flag burning is seen as inciting violence.
Recognize that intent doesn't matter when determining if speech is inciting violence.
If someone says, go do some violent act, and they intended it as a joke, and other people follow through on that, and then someone is harmed, we think that the person who spoke still ought be held responsible for their speech.
But with flag burning, even if people don't necessarily mean to incite anti-american violence, we think that that still can be the outcome.
That it does inspire sentiments that can lead to violence, it makes people think that they're going to have more support if they take violent action against the US government, and things like that.
So at the end of the day we think that in as much as this is consistent with banning someone from yelling fire in a crowded movie theater because of the risks to the public, we ought ban flag burning as well.
So with all of these reasons in mind we should prohibit flag burning.
Thank you"
"We should limit executive compensation.
In the united states we have a massive problem with inequality.
Those at the top of a corporation makes thousands of times as much money as those at the bottom.
As such we believe government should step in to rectify this imbalance.
With that in mind, we would propose the following model: that the government should pin the maximum executive compensation to the minimum wage.
We would say that in a place in the united states that has say like an eight twenty five per hour minimum wage, we would be comfortable pinning the maximum executive wage to about two hundred times that wage.
We think that this is fair and it'll guarantee that there's both political change to empower the poorest in our society but will also allow for competitive compensation among executives such that businesses can still recruit them.
With that mind we have three arguments, first on political change.
If executive compensation is linked to the minimum wage, we think that there will be increased power and increased money going towards policies necessarily empower the poorest our society.
Why is this the case?
Because executives hold a massive amount of power in our society.
They control corporations, they necessarily control the discourse in corporations, control a lot of ideas that come out in our entire society through a market based because we are a market based economy, and they're able to pump out massive amounts of money into elections.
This means that they are able to able to and willing to manipulate politics most of the time.
We believe that they also would always like a higher wage.
As such they will be willing to support the minimum wage if it necessarily means giving themselves a pay increase.
This means that in areas where the minimum wage is very low, say seven dollars and fifty cents an hour, we'll see an increase in that wage allowing people to afford more food, more amenities, and generally live a better life.
Secondly though we think that they'll be a political change because individuals who were once in poverty will have increased spending power.
Politics are necessarily controlled by money in our modern day.
Collective action groups depend on these sort of donations to guarantee that their efficacious.
If individuals who were once in poverty can now spend money and particularly spend money on activist groups who fight for their own causes we believe that money will leave politics in an incredibly important way and the people in poverty will have more political say.
Our second argument is about corporate incentives because we think that when you decrease executive pay, corporations have more resources to put towards other things.
We don't we think that the decrease in executive pay will not harm corporations because the decrease in pay will be uniform across all corporations.
Typically when you cut someone's pay, that person will leave your company and go to another but if you necessarily put a cap on all individuals' wages, you guarantee that they cannot simply switch from one business to another if they want to make a high wage.
As such there will be a decreased operating cost among corporations.
This will allow them to do one of two things: either a.
They will lower prices to compete with other industries and capture more of the economy or b, pay other employees to increase the quality of their products or increased employee morale more and compete that way.
Either way we think the well being of society is better.
Either the consumer has more power because they pay less or the average individual in the company is paid more money guaranteeing that they can live a higher quality of life as well.
Our third argument is about individual incentives because we don't think that being an executive is actually that good for the economy or for the world writ writ large.
We think individuals who are intelligent enough to rise to the top of a corporation would necessarily be making the world a better place if they put their time and energy towards other pursuits.
If they pursued technology, if they pursued being a doctor, this would allow them to still make a considerable wage but use their knowledge and experience for better uses for the world.
As such we think individuals will change industry, stop being executives as often, and make the world a better place.
So proud to propose."
"Year round schooling will bring more good than harm for two big reasons.
First because it's going to help with the way in which people learn.
It's going to actually help students academically and secondarily it's going to help students on a psychological level.
It's going to reduce stress and it's going to lead to a more positive schooling experience for students.
So let's start by talking about learning and about why this is going to help people learning.
Recognize that the way in which it the way in which people learn best is by constant reinforcement of skills over time.
This is especially true for certain types of school classes like foreign language classes math classes things like that.
And the reason why this is important is because when you're in a lot of ways not just trying to like memorize facts but learning an entire system or like having to construct entire systems and things like that and possibly systems that you may not use all the time so while maybe you're more likely to remember some of your english lessons if use that on a daily basis, or more frequently, you're not as likely to use calculus on a daily basis so you're more likely to lose those skills if you don't practice them for an extended period of time.
And that extended period of time is exactly what happens when you have the incredibly long vacations that happen.
So this is obviously very bad because when you have these more extended vacations students do forget a whole lot of things and when they forget these things it's necessary to spend more time reviewing lessons and repeating lessons.
In fact reviewing and repeating may not even be the right words.
Relearning is probably a better way to describe it because you can forget something entirely in the course of two months and over summer so therefore it's essentially just a waste of time to have to relearn these things.
Things that could otherwise be taught.
But the next way in which this is going to help is this is going to help students from the psychological perspective.
So most of the time a school routine can be quite rigorous.
You can wake up at like six o'clock in the well you have to be like wake up at six o'clock in the morning for a seven o'clock start to classes you may end classes at three PM but you probably have to do like a sport or an extra curricular or a job and then by the time that's done you probably have homework that you have to do, or a test that you have to study for and repeating that process for months on end every week is an incredibly draining and tiring process.
And therefore I think that people oftentimes do want more breaks like because it's not necessarily as important to have the one long break.
I think that people would generally find it a lot more relaxing, a lot more stressful if they could every once in awhile have those like four five day weekends, have a vacation instead of like having instead of having to do like the same week-long routines for three months in a row.
Having more breaks intermittently, which is going to be pretty good at reducing stress, making it so that people are better able to cope with a rather strenuous schooling system that oftentimes happens.
So that's very important but additionally we also think that when there is more of a why we additionally think that when you have this long vacation there's more of a pressure to use the time that you do have the like the time window that you do have much more efficiently.
So I think that what this does is this puts more pressure on students and the school like the teachers themselves to push students harder to make sure that they're learning more and more during this stretch of time because they know that a whole lot of this information is going to have to get for is going to get forgotten at some point anyways so they have to make sure they're like learning as much as possible and things like that.
So for those reasons, because it's going to make sure that students don't forget things and because it's psychologically better for students to have shorter amounts of time between breaks and a greater frequency of those breaks, since that's when you're more likely to be exhausted, you're not gonna be exhausted after a two month long break we're very proud to propose that year long schooling will do more good than harm."
"We should ban gambling.
So I think that in this debate we're talking about in countries that allow people a lot of personal freedom, allow things like certain drugs and alcohol and things like that, the kind of countries where gambling is common in the status quo, gambling should be banned uniquely.
So with that in mind we have two main arguments.
The first is about how gambling promotes criminal activity.
So recognize that what gambling does is transfer lots of money in this kind of gray environment that's very difficult to track.
Almost anybody in some precincts is able to set up a gambling institution and make lots of money.
The other team might say we're okay with only allowing regulated casinos and things like that but even these casinos tend to attract organized crime.
Why?
There's no easier way to launder money than to go to a casino and buy chips and then cash in the chips.
Now all the money is clean.
If you've ever seen the godfather part two, they were taking advantage of this.
The idea clearly goes back a long way.
And gambling is connected with organized crime in almost every country in the world.
Places like macau with a lot of gambling also have strong organized crime, los vegas you see this there as well, atlantic city.
We see that gambling invites organized crime into areas where otherwise it might not be a problem.
So we think that it's therefore bad for communities at the end of the day.
The other team might say that gambling brings money into communities so this is a good thing, but if that money is dirty money than we don't think it's going to be better for those communities to have it in the first place.
So with that in mind, our second argument is about addicts.
So recognize that many of the people who spend the most on gambling aren't able to stop themselves from doing it.
Just like you see people get addicted to drugs or alcohol people also get addicted to gambling.
Why is this a good enough reason to ban gambling?
So first of all, gambling only has harmful consequences.
Sure somebody wins the lottery, but almost everybody loses and in the long term effectively nobody makes money off of gambling.
So it's something that people find fun but that's slightly deleterious like smoking for instance, but we think that ultimately it's acceptable to regulate things when people can't choose not to participate and they have harmful consequences and gambling is a great example of this.
People who are gambling addicts can't stop gambling but they continue to experience the harms.
They aren't making a meaningful choice.
We think that at that point the government ought to intervene to protect people who can't help themselves.
The last argument that would like to make is that gambling leads to the deterioration of communities where casinos and other gambling institutions are built.
So this is a separate point about crime because it's an argument about the way that these places develop.
So when you have a city that puts in a casino you draw in lots of tourist and people like that who are spending money which seems good on face, but these people aren't coming to invest in your community.
If you had say a waterfall and people come to see that waterfall and they're also buying coffee, and spending money in the town, and paying bus drivers, and things like that, but when people come to gamble, generally speaking, they go to a casino and they spend all of their money at the casino.
So people who live in the community aren't benefiting.
It's true that it provides some jobs, but it's very different than supporting local businesses and things like that the way normal tourism does and it's difficult to develop a more traditional tourism industry when you have a one that's dependent on gambling.
Nobody wants to go to las vegas, for instance, because they associate it solely with gambling and not with all the other things that that area might have to offer.
So we think the gambling ultimately is harmful for the communities where it goes in.
At that point we think that states have a clear interest to regulate against it because it allows people to be taken advantage of in the form of addicts, its deleterious to communities, and it attracts organized crime to regions where otherwise that wouldn't be a problem.
Therefore we should ban gambling.
Thank you."
"We should close the guantanamo bay detention camp, but we're going to go even beyond that and say that the US should leave guantanamo bay and give the entire naval base back to cuba.
So, a few reasons why this is true.
First: guantanamo bay rightfully belongs to cuba and the united states stole it from them wrongfully in the twentieth century.
We see that, ultimately, the cuban government never consented to having our naval base there and that the US has maintained this through the use of force, not anything actually legitimate.
We think that this is pretty clearly just theft from the people of cuba.
We've taken over this territory and refused to give it back, even though we acquired it through legal colonial enterprise.
We think that we need to close the base because, ultimately, it's unjust for the united states to take advantage of other countries just because they're weak.
Ultimately, we're able to hold on to gitmo because the cubans can't make us leave, but we think that this is unjust, that the weak shouldn't have to fear the strong, and that it's wrong for the US to take advantage of our power over cuba.
But as a second sort of sub-argument to this, I'll point out that cuba today is not what it was fifty years ago.
The country is increasingly liberalizing and opening itself up to the rest of the world.
We've seen that it's normalized trade with the US, for instance, and we think that we should reward this good behavior by returning the naval base.
We think that maybe there was a case to be made for holding on to it when cuba was one of our enemies fifty years ago, but that's simply not the case anymore, and there's no reason to keep this territory.
Secondly, we think that we need to close down guantanamo bay in order to end the torture camp that's been run there for decades now.
It's illegal to hold and torture people in the united states proper which is why it's being done at this naval base in cuba.
So we think that by closing the base, you make it more difficult for the CIA torture program and other torture programs to continue, you take away the legal fiction that made it possible for them to claim they weren't doing anything wrong.
And obviously, the torture camp needs to be closed.
Tormenting people is contrary to the US values of human dignity and human rights and on top of that, it's ineffective.
Torturing people leads them to tell you what you want to hear, it doesn't actually give you good information.
So this program needs to end and for that reason, we should close guantanamo bay.
But our last argument is about optics.
We think that the US needs to consider its image abroad.
Right now, much of our soft power as a country is derived from being the leader of the so-called free world.
But when you run what amounts to a giant prison camp in cuba and the cubans tell everyone all around the world about how awful it is, we think that that really undermines your ability to drive soft power from that claim.
So look, even if you don't buy the other claims in this round about how the land really belongs to cuba or about how the torture program doesn't work, this is still enough for us to win.
Because if you think it's important that the US is able to spread democracy globally, that the US is able to exert itself through soft power rather than hard power, then you should want to close guantanamo bay, because hypocrisy only empowers the people who want to see you fail.
The existence of gitmo gives people like vladimir putin ammunition to talk about how the US only cares about human rights when it suits us.
If we really want to spread human rights globally, if we really want to spread democracy, then we need to walk the walk as well as talk the talk.
That means closing down guantanamo bay.
And on top of that, things like the US ability to provide trade, to invest in other countries, are also influenced by our soft power.
If we become less ideologically appealing than other countries because we're seen to be lying or doing whatever we want regardless of what the right thing is, then ultimately we're going to lose out on trade deals, lose out on allies, and that does tremendous harm to our ability to do business abroad.
So for these reasons, we should close the guantanamo bay detention camp.
Thank you."
"We should cancel the social security tax.
So we recognize that if you're to cancel the social security tax, it is likely going to follow that you need to cancel social security, which we think is something that was ultimately gonna have to happen anyway given how improperly the system is structured, but to give a cut off line, we think that it's not fair to take away the benefits of all individuals that are planning on receiving social security, especially those that have been planning and will rely on it in the near future.
We think that any individual over the age of forty five would still be able to collect social security benefits based on what's already accrued, but after that point we would eliminate the social security program altogether and of course eliminate the tax as it currently exists.
So, a few reasons why we think this is important: the first is that we think it's unjust for the state to paternalize in such a nature that just object, that only emphasizes long term, and we also think that there are short term costs that outweigh those potential long term gains.
So, recognize that longevity of life is not the most important thing in and of itself.
The ability to live a long life, to plan for the future, to do these types of things is not necessarily important.
It's only important in so far as: one, individuals value or choose to want to have the type of life, or two, individuals have the opportunity, individuals are able to internalize value through other means.
We think that there are alternative means for individuals to plan for the future if they see fit.
Recognize that if you choose not to take a social security tax, you can put that money that otherwise would been taxed into things like retirement funds, I-r-a's, and other private options that tend to perform better on the market because while they while they sometimes take risks, this often means that they pay off with larger returns and benefits for the people that pay into them.
We think that people should have the option of these types of things but the social security tax removes the liberty for people to make that decision for themselves.
And given that this tax restricts their financial freedom in the short term, there are harms that are passed on to the individual because they aren't able to access those funds that they otherwise would be able to do.
We think that this also has a disproportionate impact on the wealthy because they came very little from these types of benefits.
They would have otherwise been fine in the long run, but they're the ones that are forced to pay the largest amount of money into the social security system.
And yes we think there's a popular notion that the wealthy should pay this disproportionate amount of money into the government, but we think it's the case that these people didn't choose to be in this state just as anyone else did and that these people have worked hard for their money.
And given that this is the case we think that if the government is going to tax them at such a high rate, it should go into something that is actually going to be beneficial to all of society, including them.
Social security simply doesn't meet that barrier and there are alternative options for people that otherwise would want social security, who now are going to find alternative options.
We think there are short term costs as well.
This is a major tax on income and a loss of current assets.
The future is not guaranteed, which means if individuals had this money, and otherwise would have spent this money but go on to not collect social security because they died at young age, your simply stealing money from them that they otherwise could have used to improve their status quo.
We think that social security funding is ultimately broken is fundamentally broken the status quo and is being spent in an improper way.
We think that if you're going to have such a ludicrously high tax, there are ways that you could put this tax money to use that isn't social security, that isn't broken in such a way with the vast majority of individuals in the status quo, if it continues, simply will never be able to collect the benefits that it promises.
Given that this is the case and that the system does not is not stable, is not tenable in the status quo, and that this is a drastic preference for the future in a way that is unjustified, that doesn't give people free will and choice over their over their future and their planning, we should cancel the social security tax."
"We should limit the right to self-defense.
Right now in many jurisdictions, such as all common law countries, people have the right to reasonable self-defense.
So, if some maniac is running at you with a knife in the US or britain, you would have the right to attack that person to keep them from trying to harm you.
We think that this right should be severely curtailed in most instances.
Our first argument is that violence begets violence.
We think that ultimately when you allow this so-called right to self-defense, what you actually end up with is a more violent society overall.
People are very bad at making these decisions, as I'll explain in just a moment, but because of that, you lead to a feedback loop where everyone thinks that they are acting in self-defense, even if actually they're being completely unreasonable.
To use a perhaps not so recent but quite famous example, george zimmerman was a man in florida who murdered a young black man named trayvon martin, who was just walking down the street.
Zimmerman was a virulent racist and self-appointed community watch figure who felt that his neighborhood was being threatened by trayvon martin's presence, even though he was just a high school boy walking down the street, and zimmerman killed him.
Many people in his community thought that zimmerman was acting with reasonable self-defense, and many in the legal community argued that although he made a poor choice, because he believed he was acting in self-defense, that he should be able to take advantage of a legal protection called imperfect self-defense, which is basically when a person's state of mind changes the sentence that they receive.
We think that this is ridiculous, that it becomes an umbrella for people to be racist, to be bigoted, to attack others and be violent, and then to get away with it because, "" oh, they thought they were protecting themselves, "" or "" oh, they were acting in self-defense. ""
We think that this leads to more violence overall than in a society in which all violence is very heavily stigmatized and punished.
We would prefer the latter to the former.
Our second argument is about why it's okay for the government to intervene in this instance to take away someone's right to self-defense.
We acknowledge that in some sort of state of nature that people would have a right to defend themselves.
If you lived out in the wilderness, for instance, you would be able to protect yourself from a stranger.
But in a society, we think that it's perfectly okay for the government to limit this, because people make bad decisions when they are afraid.
We think that in the same way that we don't make let people make important decisions if they're drunk, we shouldn't let them make important decisions if they're terrified because similarly, they will not come to good conclusions.
So ultimately, because of the risk of hurting innocent people, we think that the state should intervene and drastically limit this right to self-defense.
We think that in this way you can protect innocent third parties from being harmed by other groups who think that they're acting in good faith.
Our third and final point is that ultimately the right to self-defense is a false freedom or a privilege for some groups that doesn't equally apply to everyone.
Consider, for instance, that if you are a big, burly man who served in the marines, that you're very likely to be able to defend yourself from any attacker.
But if you're a one hundred pound woman, it's much less likely that you'll be able to take advantage of this.
We can see that in many ways it's a very gendered right that only applies to men, and not even to all men.
Because we see that if you have an ethnic minority or a minority religion person defend themselves from a member of the majority group, oftentimes they'll be seen as an aggressor even if you when you were reverse the races, they would be seen as a person conducting self-defense.
So ultimately this is a so-called right that only accrues to men from the most privileged groups racially or religiously in a society.
So we don't think that this right should be granted to those people when it can't be given fairly to everyone.
So for all of these reasons, we should limit the right to self-defense.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should that holocaust denial should be a criminal offense.
Two main areas of clash, the first on why this is unprotected speech as per general freedom of speech like laws.
So recognize that we protect speech for most situations except in those where it is incendiary, AKA a cult of violence, or causes significant harm to others.
This is why for example, you cannot yell fire in a crowded theater, because clearly this is a situation in which your free speech causes significant harm to others that impedes their future rights.
Or for another example, why, call to arms, by the communist party were not allowed on fliers because even though it is free speech to be a communist it is not free speech to yell let us demolish the capitalist world through bringing up arms against our brethren.
So recognize that holocaust denial clearly does both.
First, it is often a call to violence against jews because they are seen as those people who unfairly put others in jail because they by faking the holocaust but and this leads to physical violence in and of itself.
So how many times have we seen videos in which neo-nazis assault jews by yelling that they faked the holocaust and use this as an avenue by which they can justify their future violence?
We also think that it causes deep psychological harm to those listening, especially those of jewish descent or survivors of the holocaust, because it invalidates their experiences and says you made this up, you didn't actually experience the pain that you did before.
Recognize that there is also no difference between psychological and physical harm other than the stigma that we have put in society upon it.
Because even when when even our like chemical connections in our brain fire the same way if you are to cut me then if you are to verbally assault me.
We think that at that point they become indistinguishable from each other.
There's also long term physical harm to jewish communities when they are invalidated and broken apart by this kind of speech.
So once we recognize that it is unprotected speech we can then criminalize it off that alone.
But second, let's talk about societal impacts.
Because we think that if you can show if we can show you that there is enough bad harms associated with holocaust denial, then we don't care if it's free speech that ought be protected, it ought be banned based on a utilitarian framework in which we see that the harms outweigh the like principled stance.
So let's talk about damage to jewish communities.
Because when you invalidate a community and cause others to see it is untrustworthy, it means you are taking away first, a lot of the infrastructure that comes in from other communities, but also and like public support, but also psychologically damaging the individuals that compose that community.
You're invalidating survivors' experiences, and it tells families that the losses they experienced are fake.
This is anger that never gets answered on their side of the house when when holocost holocaust deniers get to walk free after actively harming those who have to listen to them.
We think that as with any kind of crime that causes a harm it is only just if they also have to pay the price of a criminal offense.
So if one of these nazis was to come up and stab a member of the jewish community they would necessarily be placed in jail than have to pay like some sort of retributive price on this.
We think that it is no different when they tell someone that they're like that the holocaust is faked insofar as the same kind of harm is caused.
But next we want and finally we want to talk about children.
Because we think that holocaust denial is especially damaging when it is allowed into our schools and allowed to be spouted by teachers.
Very recently there was a scenario in which one a child was allowed to write an entire essay on how the holocaust was fake with sources brought up to verify it.
We think that children are often more impressionable than adults and that in these situations children very well do believe that the holocaust might have been faked.
This creates a long term unsafe and more hateful world in which children are essentially raised with anti-semitism.
Don't let them poison the minds of our youth, we think that it ought be a criminal offense.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban fraternities.
What we mean by this is that college campuses would no longer allow the existence of a fraternity or fraternity like organization to exist.
I think that those standards would be defined by like whatever the current definition of a recognized fraternity is and that this replay would then be discouraged and actively forced off campus.
Two main areas of clash.
The first on why fraternities are incredibly harmful to the individual and their behaviors.
First recognize that fraternities force students to prioritize their social life above their studies.
This is necessarily necessary true because they always require events or hazing that have to be perfect prioritized lest they get dropped from the organization entirely.
To think that even if someone comes into a fraternity thinking that they're going to be able to balance both and thinking that they're not going to have to choose between their priorities they're always going to have to choose because they're never going to want to get dropped out of this organization they worked so hard to get into.
But also because a lot of the events are mandatory that you just can't get out of hazing if you want to be part of the event.
So we think that they end up getting stuck in it.
This is bad for two reasons.
First recognize that it's incredibly stressful.
It's not easy to live a life where you are constantly worried about losing your community or trying to find a balance between your work like your academic life and your social life.
Like these are struggles that every student goes through but we don't think you should be making it infinitely more difficult by adding fraternities to the calculus insofar as they're incredibly more demanding than any normal person's social life.
But the second reason is that it risks future prospects because of the social life.
We think at the end of the day no matter how much I drink or how much fun I have at parties it's always going to be less important than the fact that the rest of my life might go to shit because of the time that I didn't spend studying or being a member like productive member of society.
So we actually think it's like incredibly important to not risk your future prospects and we think that like fraternities necessarily force people to do so.
But secondly we want to talk about how it creates drinking habits because recognize that fraternities inherently are a lot of group parties and group events that include alcohol and other substances not only do alot of people first get exposed to things like drugs through fraternities because of systematic like drug dealers and groups that like work within them but also it's you get used to drinking on the weekdays like this is normalized.
So you don't actually see an issue when you find yourself like through like once every two days drinking copious amounts of alcohol something that gets normalized around you meaning that it's a behavior that can be really dangerous in the future and so far these kind of things are addictive and habit forming.
So it means that what happens now is that after you exit college and after you're done with fraternities you've gotten so used to drinking that it's something you've no longer stop and don't have a healthy relationship with.
But finally under this I think we should talk about paying for friendship.
Since it's really problematic that fraternities have this idea that if you're going to buy your way in and you automatically get a community of friends and family whatever and I do think it's like bad to say that some people who are like structurally held out of fraternities like it's bad that like they never get access to this thing like they create this barrier on friendship that says that once you've paid me I'm obligated to be your friend but also the reverse of this where like if you haven't paid me that I'm unlikely to be as accepting of you and were unsure on why money is like a good thing to propagate here.
Our second area of clash is about the social norms this fraternities like propagate.
First I think it's like we should talk about the misogyny that often like permeates these spheres.
There's a lot of rape culture it's incredibly broey.
Like parties are often like notably dangerous for women in so far as no one asks for consent at them and that this is the one of the main places in which sexual assault occurs and no one reports it.
We think a lot of the time like fraternity are just like a lot of men who think they know things about women and so stereotypes just propagate a lot faster in these kinds of areas and so and like this is like very fundamental in that they use women and like you use the abuse of women in order to connect with each other on a social level.
But I also want to talk about the drinking culture because recognize that fraternities are based on a culture that rewards those who drink more and do more stupid things which we think is inherently a societal norm we ought discourage.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"We should ban racial profiling.
Racial profiling is the process of policing, in which individuals are either arrested, primarily because, or as a certain factor, because of the race that they are.
, so, we think that this is blatantly discriminatory, and that it is ultimately ineffective in doing the job of policing, and because of that, we should ban racial profiling.
So, firstly, why it's discriminatory?
We think that, law exists to judge people on individual cases, that law in the trial process in democracies exists to ensure that people had their fair chance at freedom, and to ensure that they have a presumption of innocence when they go into a courtroom.
We think, in order for this presumption of innocence to have any merit at all, in the way that, police choose to observe and to act around people within the polity, there needs to be a presumption of innocence there as well, that there needs to be a certain level of respect and dignity given to all people within our society, and that even when someone isn't in the courtroom, you should always have a presumption of innocence, as a public official, and certainly as a police officer.
Racial profiling skews that dramatically.
It means that you're going to use statistics to say that, this person is less likely to be innocent than someone of a different race.
And in doing so, you strip them of that presumption of innocence, and their basic human decency, when they're walking around in our society, when they're participating in our society .
And furthermore, this doesn't have any sort of effect on criminality.
Race does not genuinely, through the fact that it is race, dictate criminality.
There's nothing about being of a certain race that makes you propensity eh that gives you a higher propensity to commit crimes, even if statistics show that there are certain clusters in certain races, that per capita are more likely to be incarcerated, but I'll get to this in a second.
So, why does racial profiling cause tangible harms in the communities that are being policed?
Well, one: it makes these communities feel otherise.
When this process is used systemically within police departments, it it sends of passage from public officials, from the law, it sends the message, that we believe that you are a criminal race, or you are a more likely to be criminal person, and we this make people feel like victims in their own communities.
When they feel like victims in their own communities, there's more likely to be tension between police, which means that police efforts between police and communities, which means that, the effort of policing in the first place becomes dramatically more difficult, it's less likely to get community involvement in activity, in participation, in solving crimes, in reporting crimes, in taking care of one's own, and in this sense we think that racial profiling only serves to undermine the purpose of policing.
But secondly, we think that racial profiling is also just ineffective.
Racial profiling and crime statistics come out of a history of racial discrimination.
In a time in which which laws were modeled in order to directly target people of a particular race, such as in the united states, when the war on drugs started, as a nixon administrator, and the nixon administration said: it was the criminalization of certain drugs was done, directly to harm minorities, to harm people of color, to ensure they were incarcerated.
Directly after the end of colonialism, systems were put in place by colonial powers to ensure that they still had the labor, that they previously had from the colonial system, through laws and policing that targeted minority groups.
That's why statistics exist in the way they do, and these things have a compounding effect.
When parents are taken away from children, put in jail, and aren't able to earn money, children are dramatically more likely to end up in those cycles, if for no other reason than they have nowhere to turn, but the desperation of committing crimes, or because they grow up in an environment where that becomes normalized.
But, it's not because of who they are, and we don't think that the statistics mean that people are more criminal, it's just a sign of the hardship that they go through in society.
And because of this, we don't think that these statistics are any meaningful should have any meaningful impact on how we police.
If anything, it should have a meaningful impact in how we choose to give social goods, and social needs, to to specific communities of people.
And because of this, we believe that we should ban racial profiling."
"I'm proud to support the motion that we should make community service mandatory.
We'll model this says around the time someone leaves high school so upon graduation or upon dropping out if that's what they do.
They have to complete a certain number of hours of community service within the next year.
You know we're not going to defend a specific number but we'll say something substantial like say you know a hundred or so probably not that different from what you would expect from like a normal like prison sentence that issues community service.
We would also be willing to delay having to do this if you're going to do something else at that point in your life so like if you're going to college for example we're fine with allowing people to you know delay their community service requirement until after college.
But generally what we're talking about here is a requirement of a substantial amount of community service right as someone is becoming an adult.
So three independent points, the first is that we think that people benefit a lot from communities you know specifically the you know the networks that exist within them, the support systems, even just the beautification efforts that exist in a lot of communities like places that have a community garden or a park.
And we think that the work in creating that sense of community is often imbalanced, that activists within communities will often put in a lot more legwork than your average person.
We think then that by mandating community service we attempt to adjust for that imbalance, we say if you are living in this community and if you are deriving the benefits of being within a community we think that you should be contributing towards that community.
This can be simple, this can be you know picking up trash off the side of the road, this can be prettying up a park or a community garden, this can be putting in hours at a local soup kitchen.
We think there are a lot of ways in which people can sort of pay it forward and make up essentially for the benefits that they have received from living within that well kept community.
Our second independent point though is that this just leads to a better society that you know when you have people staffing the soup kitchen and when you have people making the parks look prettier that is just a world that is better to live in.
We generally would just be very happy defending any policy that says hey, we're going to implement this and the world's going to be a lot better because we implemented it.
That is generally a rationale that is pretty easy to get behind and we would say that if you can implement a law and it just makes people a lot happier and it makes the world a lot better we think that is a significantly you know that is a a sufficient reason to pass that law.
But our third and final independent point is that we think it creates a sense of obligation or a sense of belonging within communities, that is that when people put a lot of work into something they become invested in it.
You want to see it succeed, you want to see it thrive, you become better personally attached to it and it's beneficial when people have that sense of attachment to a community.
A lot of what the government does in the status quo is things that could reasonably be done by communities.
Obviously we're not talking with the big things like say militaries but we are talking about things like upkeeping parks and you know things like that.
We think that if people were just willing to put in a lot of work for this if people just genuinely cared a lot about it, we would be able to do things like reduce government expenditures, we would be able to just see less people trashing parks and creating that work to be done if people just cared about the parks in the first place.
We think then that by passing this policy and by requiring people to you know put a significant amount of their life and their work into just caring for this community, we think then that that will allow people to enable people or encourage people to be more respectful of that community and to really just help keep that community preserved in a way that minimizes the obligation of others to come in and clean up after them.
Proud to propose."
"We should criminalize victim blaming.
By victim blaming, we mean a process when people blame victims of sexual assault or other crimes for having been victims of those crimes rather than blaming the perpetrator.
This is, unfortunately, very common with sexual assault.
You hear people say, "" oh, you shouldn't have been walking in that area at night "", "" oh, you shouldn't have been dressed that way "", and things like that, rather than placing all of the onus on the perpetrator who, of course, is the only person who could have prevented that crime from happening in the first place.
We have three arguments for why we think that this should be criminalized.
The first is that this encourages future crime.
When people grow up in a society that blames victims rather than perpetrators, that means that people are more likely to perpetrate these crimes.
After all, they've internalized a norm that it's not their fault for committing a crime, that it's the fault of the person that they harm and so, if they're able to do this, then it must be okay and it's not really something that they can be blamed for.
This encourages a mindset that perpetuates what you might call rape culture and perpetuates violence throughout society.
It discourages people from taking responsibility for their own actions and admitting that they are being bad people if they act in this way.
Instead, they almost feel as though they're victims of someone else's availability.
And we think that this is one reason why it's so difficult to reduce the rate of sexual assault is that young men, especially, are unwilling to take responsibility for the fact that if they do this type of thing, then they're being a terrible person.
We think that in a world where this is criminalized, you send a strong signal that this isn't acceptable and also that you're able to severely punish many of the people who facilitate future sexual assault, which we think is a good end in and of itself.
Our second argument is about how this creates a risk of self-harm by victims.
If society tells people, "" you've just been through this traumatic, life-changing, horrible event.
What are you going to do now? ""
And then society blames them and says: you shouldn't have been doing this thing that people do every day that's completely normal.
It's your fault.
You were acting inappropriately.
You deserve to be punished for what happened to you.
We think that this makes it very hard for people to cope, first of all, but also that it can encourage them to have self-destructive behaviors, whether that be because it promotes mental illness and substance abuse as a way to cope or because it puts people into a position where they believe that they deserve to be punished, if they live in a culture that does punish people for being victims.
We think that, obviously, this can have huge harms to people's physical and mental well-being, and that it can prevent them from ever really coming to terms with what's happened to them and, most importantly, from moving on to lead a healthy fulfilling life afterwards.
This basically traps people in a cycle where they can't get away from what's happened because they've internalized these harmful norms, and we think that that's just unacceptable and that the government needs to step in and do something to signal to them that it's not their fault, that they shouldn't internalize these norms, and criminalization is one way to do that.
But our last argument is more specifically about why this should be a crime rather than a misdemeanor.
In many jurisdictions, defamation is a crime, essentially defaming someone else's character by saying that they did something that they didn't do or trying to change the way people look at them for the worst for something that isn't really their fault.
Victim blaming ought be considered a type of defamation, which is a crime.
Why?
Because you basically assassinate someone's character in the public sphere by blaming them for being a victim of a crime and by asserting that they did something wrong when, in fact, they haven't.
This doesn't seem that different from other cases of defamation, so I think that it should carry criminal penalties at any jurisdiction where defamation carries criminal penalties.
And even in areas where defamation is just a civil offense, we think that all of the harms to someone's well-being discussed above mean that this needs to be a criminal offense.
For all these reasons, we should criminalize victim blaming.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abandon online dating services.
What we mean by this is simply that we prefer a world in which online dating was not something that people would normally turn to or use in order to find their potential sexual or romantic partners.
Two main areas of clash: first on why online dating is uniquely sexist.
First under this is that it promotes objectification.
Insofar as when you are online dating you don't actually know the individual that you are talking to or you don't actually have any way of understanding their interests or their intellect as you would from even a cursory conversation, then it makes it very easy, and in fact necessary, for you to evaluate them based only on their physical appearance as you see it in the photos that they have on their profile.
This encourages men to continue seeing women as pieces of meat for their own appraisal.
And base their judgments of women on their physical appearance, rather than things that we think ought matter more such as their intelligence or their emotional stability or like the way they relate to the world and the similarities that they share with them.
We think that any practice that propagates the norm we have in society in which women are assessed not as individuals made up of like working components of their like emotional self, like past their physical self, then we think this is like incredibly bad.
We also think that it's really bad for women and their self esteem and their confidence.
It forces women to judge themselves by the standards that they think men would use.
This necessarily leads to a world in which I feel infinitely less comfortable eating the food that I want to eat or putting up photos of myself that I feel truly represent myself, because I have to make sure that I look sexy enough on them.
We think that what's even worse than patriarchy using patriarchal norms is that they force women to use those norms as well.
We think that in theory a world in which men just used their standards to assess women in a bubble might be fine.
Like it would still suck, but it might be fine.
But the fact that they force women to use and live under those same standards is infinitely worse and necessarily bad.
But also, recognize that these kinds of website promote gender roles.
Man are pushed to present themselves as hyper masculine and women as hyper ladylike.
Because when you are meeting in regular dating life, you meet the people the person to person and oftentimes in unexerted situations in which they act like they usually would.
But when you're online, you're more likely to pretend to present based on societal expectation.
This necessarily reinforces that norm over and over when scrolling people online.
Even if you don't think that's true, we think it's the case that when people meet on an individual day to day basis it's infinitely harder for us to imagine what all of those people look like, or have a conception of how they might behave.
We think that online dating makes it really easy to just scroll through people's photos and look at the way they present, and construct our social norms from them.
There's no world in which we fool ourselves into thinking that gender rolls might actually be going away.
But second area of clash is about why this is bad for relationships.
First, I wanna talk about catfishing.
Because recognize that it's infinitely easier to lie on the internet than it is to hoodwink someone in real life.
Like in real life, maybe you'll be able to lie about things like your job, but as the relationship goes on it would be very very difficult to continue doing so because that person would just necessarily want to get closer to you.
Meanwhile with the internet there's necessarily more of a standard of an anonymity and like more waiting periods between the person entering your physical life.
Especially since these relationships over all often happen over long distances.
This makes it really easy for someone just continue to lie about their job, or their image, or their name or their voice for a really really really long period of time.
Insofar as they can just keep making excuses as to why they can't travel the many miles to get to you, or they can just lie about where they live in the first place and things like that.
We think this is incredibly manipulative and it hurts people's emotionally and it wastes their time in a way that regular dating wouldn't.
We also think there's a certain amount of separation that a screen creates that makes it more difficult for people to connect with each other on a deeper level.
We think that when you are, when you meet online, you're necessarily built on superficial grounds that like tell you that you have to appear a certain way, or like going to be judged in a certain way, which necessarily doesn't mean that you're connection to someone in the way that you would otherwise.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abandon giving international aid.
By we, we are referring to the united states government.
With that, three main areas of clash: first, on why governments have obligations to their citizens first.
First, recognize that the government inherently serves the citizens of that country for which they live under.
Why?
First, because the social contract exists via the taxes that people pay and via the rights that they give up to live underneath a government insofar as I have to actively make myself less free because I live under a system that takes control over me but promises me certain rights in return, then they have more of an obligation to me than to someone who does not pay into that same system.
But also, recognize that governments are an aggregation of citizens, and citizens not only have like the obligation to then represent themselves in it but also, given that citizens have the power to dismantle it, we think that they are first beholden to those who have the most control there.
Recognize also that there's necessarily a tradeoff between the resources that go to other countries and the ones that go to your own citizens, that money that went to any other country could have been spent on your own welfare systems, on food, it could lead it could make sure that public housing is available to those that don't have it within your own country.
Recognize that regardless of being a western liberal democracy and relatively wealthy, the US has plenty of problems even so.
There are thousands living in poverty.
We haven't solved police brutality.
There are many who are homeless and struggling to survive, like children are still starving on a regular basis.
Until these things are taken care of, we don't think that there exists a principled justification for overlooking the needs of your own citizens to go and take care of other people's citizens.
And so we actually think that there is no world in which it is actually like something that is okay for the government to go and give out international aid insofar as we haven't solved all of our own problems.
But second, we want to talk about cycles of dependence.
Because even if right now the united states can afford to give money to others, it is unsustainable into the long term.
Even strong western liberal democracies fall into hard times.
Like sometimes it's like your own impoverished like impoverished status that rises, or like the political will to give out money to other countries fades, like such as in the current status quo, where we have a lot of republicans owning a lot of our policies.
And when that happens, we think it's important that you haven't created cycles of dependence that would screw over the countries that have gotten used to receiving money from you.
Like recognize that at the end of that when developing countries receive money on a routine basis, they stop building new economic infrastructure because they don't need to worry about it, and so that money doesn't actually go to making them sustain themselves into the long term.
Rather, now they're relying on an unstable source and if that source dries up, then the circumstances of the citizens within that country get a lot worse very quickly insofar as they don't have any of the infrastructure needed to actually protect their citizens or guarantee them a certain amount of rights.
Our third area of clash is about why this is ineffective.
Recognize that money goes to governments that are often corrupt and and or to the bureaucracy that runs under them.
Like a lot of the time the money we send places are are is money that we do not control once it leaves our hands.
We don't really have a way of enforcing any kind of tied aid or anything like that, so a lot of the time it's just like this cash transfer or like food transfer that goes directly to the officials of that other country.
The problem is that if your country's officials are corrupt, all this does is enable the current corrupt regime.
So, even if some of that money trickles down, we don't care, because this corrupt regime gets to exist for longer.
But also, we think that a lot of the time all that happens is that like this money gets tied up in the bureaucracy, and the actual citizens don't actually get help, rather it's just another mansion for like the ruler or he pours more money into the military so they can oppress the citizens better.
Like I think the massive burden on side opposition is going to be to show us that this kind of aid can actually be effective in the majority of situations, and we don't think that they can.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should lower the age of consent.
Currently in the majority of states the age of consent is at eighteen.
We think that it would be preferable if this age was closer to fourteen.
Two main areas of clash: the first on the arbitrariness of the current restriction.
Our side acknowledges that there is a line when children are too young for sex.
But we also think that this line ends at some point after puberty when your body is developed, and you've been exposed to things like sex ed in schools, and you've had years and years of media programming you about being a sexual person and what sex is.
So we think that at the point that teenagers consume so much sexual media that tells them that they are sexual objects, whether this is correct or incorrect, it doesn't matter.
The point is that this is what they are seeing on television it is unjust to limit them legally when the rest of society is pushing them to be sexual figures.
It's like putting a plate of food in front of a dog and then being angry when it eats from it.
If society tells you over and over, now is the time for you to be sexual look at these figures on television who are your age and your type, and they are all doing it so you ought be too.
It is unfair to then say that you somehow cannot participate in this even though we've basically been telling you that it is your duty all along.
More than this though, once you're in the same environment as people above the age of the consent, so a lot of the time high school juniors and seniors tend to already be eighteen years old, and just because freshmen and sophomores aren't doesn't mean that they aren't in the same environment.
We think the age is a very arbitrary dividing factor.
Because if you're the same in every other respect and society acknowledges you to be the same in every other in every other expect respect through placing you in the same classes and expecting you to fulfill the same responsibilities, we think this also means that they have to place the same kind of standard when it comes to being sexually active.
So if you're saying that I am the same as these people in every respect, but then placing that limit on sexual activity this is unjust.
Our second area of clash has to do with ending the associated pragmatic issues.
First, the frivolous legality that drags along behind laws regarding the age of consent often lead to to frivolous impacts.
So a lot of the time you have situations in which two teenagers are having sex and then the high schoolers parents find out and they press charges on behalf of their children.
Obviously this is done oftentimes without the consent of the child and it is often done in a way that is unhelpful and it ends up ruining both of these people's lives and distracting them from what they ought be focusing on which is school work.
We also think that a lot of the time what happens is that high schoolers get permanently placed on sex offenders lists for sending things like nudes to each other.
So maybe we should have an educational seminars on why sending nudes to each other is bad, but making it so that that person cannot live near a school for the rest of their life has to declaim they're like sex offender position for every job that they earn, we think that this is far too great a punishment for just sending nudes between you and your high school girlfriend and that they should not be within the limit of restriction.
More than this though, we think that removing the illegality from sex opens doorways for better communication.
Teens are less afraid to come to parents with questions about STDs and protection when they feel like it's not a like illegal thing for them to do.
So my father yelling at me that I can't have sex because I'm too young only made me much more afraid to come to him or my mom when I actually started experimenting because they had already placed this thing in my mind where if I do this I'm a bad person.
But if you don't label people as bad people for beginning to explore their sexuality early on, they're much more likely to be able to go and communicate to you what they're afraid of or whether they have questions.
And we think that it's infinitely more important to decreased teen pregnancy and STDs than it is to defend some arbitrary standard of legality.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"I think socialism brings more harm than good.
First on a principled level, socialism is unjust and is therefore oppressive when it is instituted, and secondarily I think that socialism doesn't really work all that well anyway, on account of a lot of practical consequences, as opposed to better systems of like economic and social organization.
So let's start by talking about principled objections to socialism.
I think that there's a couple of them: first and foremost, socialism inherently overrides property rights, which I think are very like very dearly important.
It's important to know that people get their property first and foremost usually by very legitimate means of putting their work into something.
It's like the result of like labor that goes into something, the craft that the put into something, and that labor is meaningful because like it's your effort it's your it could be like, maybe it's like your ideas for some kind of book, maybe it's like your research for a patent, all of these things are ultimately as a result of the labor that you put into it and they wouldn't exist, and any benefits that come from them would not exist without the effort and ingenuity that you put into it individually.
But secondarily I also think that property is in a lot of ways just like an extension of yourself and it's an extension of your identity.
So, if at any time, if like, if you don't feel a sense of ownership, say, over your computer, or a sense of ownership over the place that you live, I think there's like a good deal of identity, a good deal of like feeling of like economic security and a good feeling of like accomplishment that are associated with a lot of the, with like having possession of property.
And I think that these things are incredibly important for tangible success but also important for internal feelings like success and accomplishment and those aren't things that we should underestimate.
I additionally think that like as an additional principled objection, I think that socialism is bad because it necessarily results in imposed values on other people.
So what do I mean by this?
Socialist societies tend to take other people's money and use it for other thing.
Like you take someone's money and you use it to like have like more like big healthcare system or some other kind of like socialized system, like food or whatever, whatever kind of socialized system that exists.
Here's the problem: what this does is overrides individual preferences that people may have on how they actually wanna spend their money and this is very important because different people are going to want to spend their money in different ways.
Different people may not care as much about the longevity of their life compared to like the quality of their life.
They may be more willing to not spend as much money on healthcare, which they would be forced to in a socialist system on their taxes, they may prefer to spend that money on a nicer car if that makes them happy.
They may be better off spending that money on investing in their children's education, they may be better off investing that money and just like a nice vacation that they've always wanted to take.
There's no correct way to live a life and socialism attempts to override this by saying that there is one way in which we have to live a life and that this is the way in which these things have to work.
And I think that's like an inherent degradation of the like individuality of human life, which is bad.
So, all those principled objections are enough for socialism to be bad but socialism is also bad because it doesn't work.
So, I think that like capitalism generally results in one, more money accumulated by more people, and secondarily it results in like more innovation.
So these things are good because when more people are making more money, they're able to like improve their qualities of their lives, but also a innovation focused drive also means that like quality of life goes up.
So like what are like concrete ways which these things look like?
So, things like like the green like thing you can look at something like a green revolution in farming because of like like, big corporations getting involved in these things like that and they can lead to like genetically modified foods that save billions of lives possibly, by preventing starvation.
You can see that things like like factories in a lot of parts of the world do increase like the wealth in those areas.
It's not a perfect system, you probably want more regulation, but it was certainly better than before where there was almost no money and no opportunities for economic growth or infrastructure investment in areas.
All of these things do help and this is why global poverty has been plummeting and capitalism does work.
So for all those reasons socialism does more harm than good"
"The motion for today's debate is that we should end progressive taxation.
The way we're going to model this is fairly simple.
We think that above a certain poverty line which can be drawn based on statistics with regards to where the poverty level actually is in the country or, like, the average by which people can support themselves without external help from programs such as medicare or welfare, and we think that people who earn for income above that level of poverty would each have an applied flat tax depending on what the government requires.
So, say, if you have a large sprawled-out government, something like the united states, your tax might be fairly high, so a flat tax of maybe ten, fifteen percent, but if your government is smaller, it can stay around five percent, etcetera, etcetera.
Two main areas of argumentation: the first on why we think it's fundamentally unjust to have a progressive tax.
We think there's a general recognition in society that people have rights to property and that the fruit of someone's labor is property as well.
And we think that just because the fruit of your labor changes in semblance, whether it is money or the actual creation of the material, do not change the fact that it is still your property and the fruit of your labor.
So let's sketch this out real quick, right?
We think that first and foremost, property rights exist.
We think it is bad when people steal each other's each other's goods, that if something is within the boundaries of my house, if I built it, if I bought it, then having it taken away from me is a violation of a right, and we find this viscerally to be true.
Second level to this then is that if I do something with my body, if I build a cabinet, if I chop some wood, these things become my possessions and we apply property rights to them.
But we don't understand why the line stops at money.
Why suddenly because my labor, instead of getting a cabinet out of it, I get a couple hundred thousand dollars or etcetera, changes the fact that it is still property and still my right?
In fact, we think it's exactly the same thing.
Just because instead I'm getting money doesn't mean I own it any less.
What this means is that taxation, as a whole, is a kind of theft that needs to be justified, because we think that any taxes on the part of the government are, at their core, an act of like the taking away of property.
We we have to understand that it is worth it.
So, we think that some redistribution is okay.
But you have to warrant why somehow because people are earning more, they also have to be taxed higher than others.
Because it is okay to say everyone gets taxed the same in order to benefit others society, but it is not okay to place that undue burden and take more from some.
We think that the other side has to warrant this.
But more so, we think that this system just isn't circumstance-based enough.
Presumably in a flat tax, everybody can afford to pay it, especially if it's applied above a certain poverty level.
But the problem with the progressive tax is that, yes, there are some outliers, people who are single people who just want to earn a lot of money, but a lot of the time people work to earn more because they have to support more people, they need to spend more, they're supporting family abroad or have many children, and we think that any kind of system has to recognize these kinds of circumstances.
Our second area of clash has to do with general pragmatic impacts.
First we want to talk about why it discourages people from working harder, reaching for those promotions, being real innovators.
We think that a lot of the time people are motivated by the amount of money they're going to make.
But if the amount of money you're going to make is going to be marginally more than the amount that you make previously, because a lot of that money is getting sucked out through progressive taxes, then you're probably not going to feel very motivated to work for a promotion that is also going to make you work many more hours.
We think people make these tradeoffs.
They say, "" I'm willing to spend more hours in the office and less hours doing the things that I love and seeing the people that I want to see because I want more money. ""
But if you're not getting more money and you're just wasting that time and that energy, we don't think people are going to do it anymore.
Second, though, we think that there are inner class tensions that develop specifically because of the progressive taxes.
Because even if you don't buy that it is unjust, it is true that rich people, in general, do think it is unjust.
They stop donating to charities, they stop wanting to support good policy decisions in the long term, because they feel like they are being taken advantage of, and we think at least in order to prevent those impacts, we ought not have a progressive tax.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should subsidize adoptions.
When we say we're going to subsidize adoptions, we would provide significant financial resources for parents that choose to adopt, not just during the adoption process we want to give an additional incentive for people to do this so we're going to give them additional funding and tax breaks following the adoption period while they still have the child.
Two big reasons, the first is that we think adoption is just good in principle.
There are many children, thousands of children in the world, who are up for adoption who will never be adopted, people that will go their entire lives without having parents or having a family or having some sort of stability.
Ultimately these children either become foster children or wards of the state, and it doesn't give them a stable environment to develop in.
They're either moving from foster home to foster home not being able to put roots down, form relationships, have role models in their lives to look up to to get advice from to have that type of caring and affection that a parent can.
And we don't and we think that these children deserve to have a home life with caring parents just like anyone else.
These children did nothing to warrant being orphan, these children did nothing to separate themselves morally or physically from those children that get to grow up in loving households with parents that are able to nurture them and want to care for them.
We do not need more people on the planet.
There are already seven billion of us and if everyone on this planet lived like americans lived, we simply wouldn't have enough resources to to allow all those people to survive.
We're already over the cap of people on the planet that fundamentally we really could support if we want everyone to have a high quality of living and we think it's just socially better to adopt given that there's in fact negative benefit to bringing a new being into the world because it puts us even further over the resource cap and the the population cap that our resources can support.
We think it's preferable to give caring and resources to those who already exist.
Recognize that it's just morally preferable to having a new child if you adopt.
The reason for this is that the new child does not exist until it's conceived and until that child is conceived, there's no obligation to beings who could be.
There's no sort of moral obligation that I have to the infinite many people that I could bring into the world if I chose to have a child but we do have an obligation to our fellow humans to correct for the suffering brought upon those humans by our own actions and additionally by the lottery of birth that doomed people to a lower level of living than they otherwise could have had if they were able to grow up in a stable family.
Secondly, we think that this is just a good use of subsidy.
Given that subsidies are being are use of public taxpayer money we think that they need to go to some sort of public good and we think that this serves that process.
In the status quo adoption is incredibly difficult.
The process can take a very long time, even in some cases over a year.
It's also incredibly costly not only to fly out to foster not only to to fly out to orphanages and to other places in which children are being fostered.
It's also a lot of money to bring those children back, to make sure they get adequate medical care, to actually go through the legal process of adopting and there's also a lot of social pressure on people to have a child of one's own because that is how we've grown up in our society is that it's considered a normal part of life that you grow up you get married and with your partner you have a child that's the combination of the two of you.
We don't think there's any sort of preference or moral that betterment of having a child of your own than there is to taking care of a child that already exists.
We think this subsidy creates a clear social good in the fact that it improves the lives of those that are in oftentimes the least well off and it's a subsidy that in theory is accessible to anyone that wanted to adopt.
For these reasons, we should subsidize adoption."
"Global warming is a major threat.
So we have two main points, but before I get into that, I think some definitions will be useful for this debate.
When we say global warming we mean man made climate change, and when we say is a major threat, we think that this poses an existential threat to the human species.
So I think that when we have this debate, our side is going to defend that this is an existential threat, and the other side has to defend that it is not an existential threat.
So two points.
The first is about sea levels, and the second is about agriculture.
So with regard to sea levels, most people around the world, according to the united nations, live very close to the coast.
If you think about cities like shanghai or singapore or new york or london, they are all very close to the sea.
There are entire countries, most notably bangladesh, which are entirely at sea level.
With this means is that when, due to global warming, the ice caps in greenland and iceland begin to melt and the sea levels begin to rise, millions of people are going to lose their homes and be displaced.
So let's think about bangladesh.
It's one of the most populous countries in the world, it's due to pass two hundred million people, and due to global warming it is likely that the entire country is eventually going to be under water.
Almost the entire country is part of one large river delta, which means that it's basically at sea level.
So what happens when hundreds of millions of people in countries like bangladesh, and around the world more generally, are displaced?
It is going to lead to a type of conflict which has never been seen before in human history.
If you imagine that for instance, the roman empire was overthrown because a few thousand people wanted to move into the empire because of shifting conditions in northern europe, imagine what will happen to civilization today when hundreds of millions of people need to be resettled.
Countries like india for instance, are not in a position to take these people in.
We don't think that there is space for them in most countries around the world, and ultimately, we think that the reason why these people live near the coast is that it's the best place to live right now.
So we're going to lose out on some of the best places to live around the world.
There's nowhere to settle these people, and it's going to lead to massive conflicts that will mean the end of civilization as we know it, and that's not speaking hyperbolically.
We've seen that mass migrations in the past led to the fall of the roman empire, of chinese dynasties, of indian dynasties, and we are in a position where we face the same thing today on a scale hundreds of times worse than anything seen in the past, and if that isn't an existential threat to humanity, I don't know what is.
Our second point is about agriculture.
Recognize that the only reason why we're able to support billions of people in the world today is that we've been able to genetically engineer certain crops that produce lots and lots of food.
Now, what these crops rely on is being able to grow in certain environments.
The most productive soils and the most productive environments are also the ones that are at threat from global climate change.
So think about a region like the central united states, where lots and lots of food is grown for export.
Millions of people around the world, billions probably, are dependent on places like iowa and illinois and corn production in order to feed animals and people.
So due to global warming, these areas are gradually going to get too warm for good corn production, and what's more, rain patterns and wind patterns are going to shift so that they lose their fertility.
Now, the other team might see that we can just farm areas further north, like central canada.
But the soils in those regions are not the same as the soils in the current grain producing regions.
Central canada, for instance, has very acidic soils that wouldn't produce as much corn as the soils of places like illinois and iowa.
This is catastrophic because it means that the food security of the entire human race is at risk due to global climate change.
Again, this is puts us at risk of famines on a scope that have never been seen in history, and that must be the kind of existential threat to humanity that we're talking about in this debate, when billions of people will have to go without food because our food producing regions will no longer be fertile.
So at the end of the day, global warming is a major threat, an existential threat to humanity, because of rising sea levels, and because it will damage our agriculture.
Thank you."
"Embryonic stem cell research brings more good than harm.
So I want to lay out some facts for the debate before we plunge into the arguments.
So when we talk about this type of embryonic stem cell research we mean extracting special cells called stem cells from a preimplantation human embryo.
So this is at a phase when the embryo is about one hundred cells and before it has implanted in the mother and begun to move up to the womb.
So basically this is an extremely early point in the development of the embryo before it becomes a fetus.
We see that many countries around the world there are regulations against stem cell research while other countries have encouraged it.
So with that in mind we have two arguments for you.
The first is about the utility of the medical research that is possible because of embryonic stem cell research.
So look, doctors are not out there extracting these cells at great cost and protesting to gain the right to extract these cells at great cost because they think it's cool or fun.
There are real pragmatic benefits to allowing this type of research.
We see that many doctors believe that things like novel cancer treatments that could be extremely effective will be possible as a result of this research and as a result of being able to experiment with stem cells to see what they can and can't do, and we think it's likely that ultimately we'll reach a point where you don't have to extract new stem cells every time you need to do research.
It may be possible to clone them, although the technology doesn't seem to exist right now.
So if you want to have a world where we have access to these cancer cures and we don't have to harvest these embryos we think that that's possible but you need to accept the short term harms of doing that in the status quo, but on top of that we tell you that there is a net good to society from allowing this type of research.
We tell you that it's very likely that there will be unexpected positive discoveries as a result of this embryonic research.
We see that this is been the case in the past with other forms of medical research that have turned up unexpected benefits, but aside from this, we tell you that ultimately the cancer treatments are likely to be so great that they outweigh any possible harms to pursuing this research.
So that leads me to my second argument because I think that the benefits of the medical researcher are intuitive, this is a little more complicated.
We tell you that the embryo lacks moral consideration or ought to lack moral consideration.
First of all the embryo has no humanity.
Where as you or I or a third trimester fetus all have hundreds of millions billions of cells.
We tell you that this embryo is made up of only about a hundred cells.
It is much less complex than a grape and we think that it deserves about the same level of consideration as a being of equal complexity.
We tell you that every human being alive has certain characteristics such as clearly defined organs et cetera that are completely lacking in this organism which hasn't yet implanted in the mother and which is completely unable to sustain itself in any way without her support.
But on top of that we tell you that there is a strong legal precedent for not giving rights to an embryo at this stage.
There's a medication in the states it's called plan b.
It may have different names around the world, but effectively the way it works is it prevents an embryo from implanting in the uterus.
So basically what happens is if someone has unprotected sex or is afraid they may become pregnant they can take this pill up to twenty four hours after having that sex and they won't get pregnant as a result, because it'll prevent the embryo from implanting.
So we see that it is already legal to kill this type of embryo in the status quo in many countries around the world including the united states.
We think that at the point we're allowing people to do this for their own personal good, which we firmly support on our side of the house, we don't see why you shouldn't allow people to choose to participate in medical research so that it can be done for the good of society as a whole.
This is an extension of an already existing practice that makes it even more socially utile, but even if you think that these cells do deserve some moral consideration, we think that clearly the benefits to real living people with cancer outweigh the harms to the cell that has no ability to understand suffering or feel pain.
So for these reasons we think that embryonic stem cell research brings more good than harm."
"Subsidize recycling.
We think that what we're meaning by subsidization is specifically focusing primarily and like first and foremost on efforts to extend accessible recycling to regions that currently don't have it.
I come from an area that just doesn't have bins that can be taken from someone's doorstep with recycling rather you have to collect your recycling and then drive to an area forty minutes away to get it recycled.
Clearly this is a very massive disincentive from someone ever recycling in my area because people are busy, they have jobs and lives and it is an awful expectation to say that it is the burden on them to go and perform such a rudimentary task when we aren't expected to do so with our trash.
We think that these kinds of accessibility issues are what are preventing us from accessing a world in which recycling is normalized and in which we're saving more resources and preventing things like pollution.
So with that, three main areas of clash, first on the culture shifts.
We think that the normalization of recycling is a really important component of this round because currently the problem is that there is no shame in the majority of places if you're not a recycler because in a lot of these areas it is simply not a reasonable expectation for you to be a recycler.
If you have to drive forty minutes to an hour to get to the place where you recycle everything, if you have to save things for months and months and months in your basement because you just don't use enough materials that are worth recycling to do it more regularly, if you are really really busy or don't have a car these are all very easy impediments in the status quo that we think ought be eliminated and we've seen can be eliminated by like characterized by the fact that if you live in anywhere in massachusetts or new hampshire or many other states in the united states you don't have to do those drives and you have those bins on your doorstep.
We think that we need to create a world in which it is reasonable to expect the average person to recycle and so they have no excuses.
Recognize that government signaling influence in these kinds of things in a way that interplays with the fact that we are now like monetarily and accessibility wise influencing it.
If the government says hey look we're taking the climate seriously now we're taking recycling seriously now that's something that people tend to follow because the government represents a certain amount of role model to the general population or at least to like specific subsets of the population that we think would be influenced here.
We also think that like this is this is generally something that is like good in other ways too which brings us to our second independent point which is about conserving resources.
Recognize that aluminum, plastics, and a lot of the other materials that are recyclable are incredibly limited and actually quite expensive, like aluminum is literally a non renewable resource so the more aluminum foil we do not recycle the more expensive aluminum gets future on.
So we think the problem there is that you are literally throwing away things that could be reused and may keep that cheap and keep that accessible to other people in the future but also recognize that landfills in themselves are also limited land masses like that a space that once you fill up no longer exists and it is a space that is very like not particularly accessible in other locations like you have to have landfills in particular areas and that's not something that changes on either side of the house and recognizing there's also an environmental impact in that a lot of the recyclable stuff that gets thrown away is also the most likely to leak chemicals so a lot of the plastics that we give out a lot of the silicons like all of the technology that we throw it in the trash all of these have environmental impacts in that they will leak chemicals that will like do things like pollute ground water kill animals so on so forth.
Or third area of clash isabout economics.
Recognize that like a lot of these products just get more expensive if you're not recycling them because now you have to go back into the manufacturing process or in the case of like non renewable resources such as aluminum or a lot of the heavy heavy metals or rare metals that our like technology computers phones etcetera is made out of these things get more expensive every time you throw one of them out.
We think that recycling saves money on landfills and on new materials, we really think there's no reason not to subsidize it, and we think it's a reasonable thing to expect the government to provide insofar as it is the people who end up suffering the government needs to be protecting.
Proud to propose."
"National service should be mandatory in the US first, because there is a duty and an obligation that you have to help your country in a certain capacity because of what it gives to you and secondarily, this is almost a form of paternalism because it's going to force solutions to problems of youth unemployment and function almost as a progressive way of job placement.
But first I want to talk about the model for this and about how we foresee the implementation of national service because when national service in the united states should be mandatory.
I think that obviously this can include military service but it can also include non military service in the way of serving in one of the merry many bureaus and agencies or even in some kind of like national office in a more local capacity.
This could also mean some kind of trade job or training in that regard things like that.
We also don't necessarily care when you do it as long as you do it like in like a reasonably soon part after in your life.
So if you're not going to college maybe this could be after you turn once you turn eighteen you do it for say like two, three years.
After college you can do it for a few years or maybe even after say law school you could do something like say be a public defender.
I don't want to constrain the ways in which national service can be done and I think that we would have a rather expansive view about what would qualify as long as it's serving a public interest and it's being done at a reasonable at a reasonable time in an early point in your life.
So let's talk about the duty to help your country because any financial success or career success that you're going to have later in your life is while in large part due to your own successes, also due to the system that the country creates for you as a whole.
Whether it's the capacity to like secure your assets the safety and security that your country provides to you the legal systems and the justice system that the country provides in order to mediate conflicts and make sure that justice is upheld or the more basic ways in which just like various utilities public utilities are served for you.
We rely on these things in just about all aspects of our lives.
It's impossible for us to really go about our daily lives without relying on the government and its services in one way or another and this is very important because even though everyone in society takes advantage of a lot of services that the US government provides, they're notoriously undervalued and notoriously understaffed in a lot of circumstances.
So you could have people like public defenders who serve very important public purposes to make sure that our criminal justice system can like stand up for itself and they're notoriously overworked and notoriously understaffed because a lot of people don't go into those careers because they don't see that is where the money lies.
So you necessarily have to create this mandatory requirement in order to push people into these careers that while they may not be as lucrative serve an incredible public importance.
But I also think that this is important because it means you're going to get better and more qualified people.
So no longer are public service jobs just going to be for the people who can't get inside like more lucrative private sector jobs.
It's going to be something that everyone goes through which is going to mean that the quality of performance in these jobs are higher but it's also going to create more of a sense of importance amongst the population for these jobs.
The final thing that I want to talk about is about job assistance in placement because I think that that's very important too.
I think what this is going to do is it's going to force job creation because you're going to be when you're required to do something it's going to force the government to ensure job placement in public service industries.
So in a time in which there's high youth unemployment and a lack of job opportunities for a lot of youth, especially more underprivileged youth, this is a very vital way to get someone's foot in the door for a career and create job experiences which can help someone for the rest of our lives.
So for all those reasons national service should be mandatory."
"The motion for this debate is that we should protect the antarctica continent.
What we mean by this is that there should be stipulations that regard not allowing drilling in that area, not allowing for nations to claim it as their own, and also regulations with regards to global warming outputs given that these lead to the direct melting of glaciers in antarctica and basically other regulations that would protect us from global warming.
Two main areas of clash: the first on aesthetic value.
We think that there is value to the existence of diversity in terms of animals and landscapes regardless of whether or not they serve an alternative like purpose for humans.
Given that these things existed before humans did, and often can exist without humans at all, we think that it is that it isn't a like real thing to evaluate all beings with regards to a utilitarian standpoint and how they work for mankind.
Rather we think that a lot of these things have inherent value based on their ability to grow, to diversify, and in the case of animals, to suffer.
So we think at the point that landscapes such as those found in antarctica have are like beautiful and self sufficient, we think that they ought be protected because they have inherent value and not just value based in how they can serve mankind.
A second layer to this is that the local life just doesn't deserve it.
We think that polar bears and penguins drowning is an animal rights violation given that it is the equivalent of humans painfully murdering animals on their own.
So we think that at the point that these animals feel suffering and they can feel their environments being destroyed, we also think that it is a very easy link to show that humans are the direct cause of that given that if people did not exist there would be no global warming and those in the antarctic would be completely safe.
So at the point that we are actively causing the suffering of innocent animals and not just one or two but rather thousands and thousands of them, we think that at the point that it comes at very little cost to humans to protect antarctica, like maybe a little bit more money comes out of taxpayer pockets, and maybe you're a little bit less comfortable because you're running your heat less or your choosing cleaner energy, but in the end we think that the suffering of thousands of animals far outweighs that.
Our secondary of clash has to do with self preservation.
The melting of the glaciers in the antarctic actively destroy human life and especially coastal land masses.
So recognize that if the ocean rises three inches coastal nations actively get destroyed and suffer dramatically.
We already see this occurring when the tides of nations like madagascar destroy entire villages on the coast and make it impossible for them to grow their food there anymore and starve entire nations.
So when you are when you're not preserving antarctica and you're not preserving those glaciers, you are contributing to the destruction of human land mass and human like human life.
More than this, there are a lot of scientific discoveries and research that occur in the arctic that cannot occur anywhere else.
Very similarly to the jungle, you have historical artifacts that cannot be found anywhere else.
So like mammoth tusks and artifacts from the ice age that we know very little about, we can piece together bits of our history, and bits of genetic history more specifically, in order to understand the world and humanity better.
We think that these are like very important things that ought be protected and when you lose them due to global warming, it is a loss on the part of like what we could benefit from as humanity.
More than this though, we think that the economic damages are very large because, as we mentioned, when you're destroying coastal villages because your your sea level is rising, you're also destroying means of production, you're destroying farmland, and you're destroying like objects and cattle.
So what this means is that you have to be replacing hundreds of acres of farmland but more importantly you have to be replacing not just the economic growth of that but also how many people that it fed.
So it exacerbates issues of world hunger and things like that.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"Physical education should be mandatory.
So, by physical education we mean things like gym classes in primary and secondary school.
So, with this in mind, we have three arguments for why this should be the case.
The first is about the good of the child.
We think that education in general is conducted for the benefit of young people.
It's probably the case that most ten year olds don't want to be studying arithmetic or shakespeare, but we make them do it anyway, because we recognize that it's for their own good.
There's an ancient philosophical maxim, sound mind in a sound body.
We think that it's not enough to fill children's head with knowledge and civic skills.
We think that we also need to provide them with the ability to have good health in the future, and also to be useful citizens.
In terms of health, it's obviously going to be to the benefit of children to provide them with a healthier body so that they will be better off into old age.
If people are physically fit as young people, it's much more likely that they'll be physically fit as they grow older.
And we see that for instance, who exercised more when they're younger, are less at risk of debilitating diseases like obesity and diabetes.
So ultimately it's in these children's interest that we put them through physical education.
But we think that another important part of physical education is sport.
And that by playing sports, young people learn important skills such as teamwork and how to accomplish a common goal.
Or even if they play individual sports, they still learn the value of discipline, and hard work in a way that they wouldn't necessarily learn in the classroom.
So we see that it's clearly in the good of individual children to require physical education.
And for that reason, the state should make it mandatory, so that all of them have equal access.
Because, when something is required, ultimately everyone has access to that thing.
Our second argument is about why there's a compelling state interest in physical education.
So, recognize that in countries with conscription like the republic of china or israel, the ability of the state to have useful conscripts is dependent on the physical fitness of people graduating from school every year.
If you have lots and lots of eighteen year olds who are graduating from secondary education and they can't run a mile in eight minutes, much less run a mile in six minutes carrying a bunch of equipment, then we think that at the end of the day they're not going to be particularly useful in a military operation.
What that means is that much of their time in conscription it's going to be wasted on physical conditioning, when that could have all been done while they were in school.
But on top of that, citizens who are healthier are less likely to have health problems in the future.
Which means that the burden on the state health care regimes such as national health in britain or medicare and medicaid in the united states, is going to be lower because people will have fewer health problems overall both in youth and in old age.
We think that because of this clear financial interest, the state should intervene to encourage people to be healthy at a younger age.
Our third and final point is that we think that people will be better employees if they go through this physical education.
Many jobs, particularly for people who don't go on to higher education, require some base level of physical fitness.
It's true that you don't have to be arnold schwarzenegger to work stock at a clothing store, but you do have to be able to lift a 50 pound box overr your head, which is something that unfortunately many young people don't have the physical fitness to do right now because they don't go through this physical training in school.
So we see that people are missing out on employment opportunities.
And many better jobs such as manufacturing et cetera, require a basic level of physical conditioning.
The only way to guarantee that everyone has that level of physical conditioning is through physical education in schools.
So at the end of the day, we see that young people will be more valuable to employers, which ultimately will lead to economic growth, and also allow them to provide a better lives for themselves and their families as a result of this.
So because it's to the benefit of every child and it's part of their education, because the government has a clear interest in having useful soldiers and healthy citizens, and because it makes these people better employees, we think that physical education should be mandatory.
Thank you."
"We should limit the exploitation of natural resources.
On our side we recognize that natural resources are extremely precious and that sometimes we have to use them for certain processes but that this is something that shouldn't be done willy-nilly, that we need to take it seriously when we use up our natural resources.
So with that in mind, we have two main arguments for our side.
The first is that our resources are fundamentally finite and we need to consider how this affects future people and the second is about how the private sphere often gains at the expense of the public sphere when we exploit our natural resources.
So on to our first argument here.
We would tell you that because natural resources tend to be finite, for instance once you mine aluminum out of the earth it's gone and you'll never get more aluminum in the earth.
We need to consider that the use now prevents its use in the future.
We think it's important to treat ourselves as stewards of our natural resources who have to consider everyone who comes after us rather than to just see this as free money buried under the ground.
One thing to factor in here is that current extraction processes are often very dangerous for the environment, very dirty for instance and often inefficient.
Consider that back when oil was first discovered in texas, they would just let these oil pumps run all the time and a huge amount of the oil ended up getting wasted and going into the ground and getting into the groundwater rather than being barreled.
Where as today there's very very little waste barring some sort of industrial accident.
So you can see that it might have been better if some of that hard to access oil had been extracted in the nineteen nineties rather than being extracted in the nineteen twenties when technology just wasn't as good.
Similarly, maybe in the future we'll be able to mine in the rockies without tearing down whole mountains for instance or maybe we'll be able to extract coal without destroying entire river systems.
It seems quite likely that technology will continue to get greener and more sophisticated and less wasteful.
So if we extract fewer resources now than when they are extracted, it'll be done in a better way.
But moreover, we also have to consider that future people are also going to need these resources and that when there are consumables like coal or natural gas, we need to conserve them for the future so that other people are able to access them as we were, at least as much as possible.
And our second argument is about this problem of privatization.
In most countries mineral rights are seemed to belong to the public and then they're sold off.
For instance if you own a piece of land oftentimes you don't own the right to drill under it, the state does and in the past, in america at least, these mineral rights have been sold off well below any sort of market value.
Oftentimes companies will survey land and then buy it from the government who has no idea that there are valuable minerals in it so it sold at pennies on the dollar for what it's actually worth.
This impoverishes the public because it's taking away one of our most important public resources, namely the land, and it makes a handful of very very wealthy people and companies even richer.
This is a couple of problems.
First, in many developing countries it siphons riches out of the country.
The only real valuable resource that a country like say malaysia has to offer to the world aside from its labor are its natural resources.
But if you have a dutch company like shell coming in and buying land and drilling for oil and then sending the profits back to the netherlands, the people in that country aren't really benefiting very much.
So we see that you have a public resource being used for entirely private profits and we think that's not a good thing because it reduces the amount of money that's available to build schools and the like.
Now the other side might so that you can tax those profits but in practice it's very difficult to tax these large multinational companies especially oil and resource extraction companies that often have a larger size than some country's economies.
For all these reasons, we should limit the exploitation of natural resources.
Thank you."
"We should abolish eminent domain.
The ability for government to simply take property because it deems it a societal good is fundamentally unethical.
Each individual contracts some of their rights away to the government.
However, they do not contract away all of their property rights.
It would be unacceptable for the government to come in and say, "" , yes, a politician wants your food, wants your clothing, and as such we are taking it.
We'll pay you what we think is the market price, but it's ours now. ""
Governments have a massive asymmetry of power and it is essential that we do not further expand this by allowing unjust use of eminent domain.
Even in cases where eminent domain is seen as just, the myriad of alternatives available to politicians in the government make it fundamentally unethical for them to pursue this as a course of action.
With that in mind, we would propose the following model: that all governments which use eminent domain, which have the right to take away property and pay the market price for it, no longer have that ability.
They can ask for certain pieces of property.
They can request it beforehand.
However, they cannot simply take it away.
Three arguments for why this is a good idea: first, on government obligation.
As I said before, there is a massive asymmetry in power between an individual and the government.
They can jail you with almost no cause.
They can take away your property through civil asset forfeiture if they believe you have committed a crime.
They can sue your property, essentially taking it away, because they think your property was involved in a crime, even though you were not involved in that crime, and otherwise simply can enforce their will over you with incredibly little recourse on your part.
This means the usage of eminent domain is incredibly dangerous.
There's almost no oversight of government action as each politician is in no way individually blamed for the results of their laws, police officers are not blamed for their actions almost ever, and we think anytime a politician is blamed and voted out of office, it's very frequent that another politician of the same ideology comes to power instead.
As such, we must limit the total number of tools available for politicians to restrict individual liberty, and one of those is eminent domain.
By making sure that politicians cannot simply use their lack of planning as a reason to take away your property, we think that everyone will be happier and the balance of power between individual and government will be far more clear.
My second argument is about private planning.
Individuals have certain plans in regards to their property.
If I have a derelict house that I bought two years ago and I intend to renovate it, if the government comes in and pays me the market price, then they're not paying what I would get out of it given my own efforts.
We think it is essential for individuals to have faith in their own ability to plan as private people and in their ability to use their private property however they see fit.
By restricting the ability for individuals to plan on a private level, people lose faith in the government, lose faith in their own ability to engage in a free market, and otherwise are less likely to actually take risks and are more likely to simply let their money sit in banks where it cannot be utilized in any way.
My third and final argument is about price subjectivity.
It's impossible to simply say the market price for a house is x dollars.
If I have lived in a house my entire life, it's been passed down from generation to generation, that house may be priceless.
The only amount of money that would actually get me to move is in the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.
We think this is an inherent part of our economy.
If every single person puts an incredibly high price on a good, that is the price of the good.
If certain people sell it cheaply and certain people sell at an expensive price, just simply buy it from the cheaper people.
If you are taking people's property away without paying them the price that they themselves request, you are not actually giving respect to their property and you are fundamentally restricting their ability to engage in a capitalist system.
For this reason, we should abolish eminent domain."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should prohibit reality television.
So, reality television is just this category of television in which people are oftentimes like competing or it's supposed to mimic reality for like oftentimes cheap tricks and competitions.
With that, two main areas of clash: the first on the exploitation of individuals.
Recognize that right off the bat, the way by which people are like lured into reality TV is often incredibly coercive.
A lot of the time they're promised a prize that they're unlikely to receive, whether it is the bachelor in which this prize might be the ultimate like love affair with an individual and marriage, but it's really unlikely you're going to get that, first, because the majority of individuals just use it to like propagate themselves as potential actors, but also because you're going to be one out of a million individuals and it's just really unlikely you're ever going to win.
But and so, because of that, we actually think that like the way in which people are called upon necessarily like begs upon the person's most internal like desires and insecurities in a way that is really problematic.
But once you get on to the show, we think that the problems only arise more heavily, right?
Like we think the mistreat of consent and emotions in these situations is really bad.
These networks have a massive incentive to make drama, because they want people to watch their show and be really entertained by it and never leave.
So they have an incentive to make people flustered, offensive, hurt, unhappy, anything that will like extricate a large enough reaction that when they put it on air, it's going to cause people to watch and be surprised and sit in suspense.
This means that these shows always record people in the most intimate and embarrassing situations regardless of their desire to be recorded or not, but also that they often undergo massive amounts of editing in order to portray the individual as radical and as like extreme as possible.
Like we recognize that like it's really unlikely that anyone is as one-dimensional as these shows usually portray them as.
Like you're always either the angry ex-girlfriend, or the angry current girlfriend, or the nagging something or like the aggressive man, and and we think that like misrepresenting individuals like this is really damaging to them.
First, like a personal, emotional level, like it sucks when this stuff happens to you, but also in terms of like when you go back out into the public, and individuals watched the show and believed in it now vilify you and shame you in the public sphere.
We think that's really bad and that individuals should never have to put themselves through these kinds of harms, especially not for a stupid TV show.
Our second area of clash is about the propagation of bad social norms.
First, I think it's important to point out that there's a lot of racial racial and like sexist problems when it comes to reality television as a whole.
There's a massive issue with underrepresentation in that a lot of these shows don't have members of minority groups, because they don't sell as well as having like a gorgeous white protagonist that everybody has gotten so used to.
And when they do have them, they have to stereotype them to feel confident that people are actually going to buy into it, because they think that people identify with these stereotypes and are more likely to watch the show if they have them.
We think this is really bad because it leads to racial minorities being forced into do the same narrow constraints that society forces them into over and over, and forces them to personally reaffirm the stereotypes that are oppress them.
Like we think it's a problem that big brother gets away with having a sassy black woman on every episode that drops early on in the tournament and also always has the same exact personality as the one before it, but they get away with it because that's what viewers like to watch.
And so we would prefer a world in which that didn't happen.
But we also think that a lot of the time, these things are incredibly sexist and that they misportray the power dynamics between men and women.
Like men are always up for like physical tasks these shows often include, while women are catty and manipulative and sit in the background.
Like there's a reason that it's really rare for women to win big brother, and it's because they're always misportrayed by the show as someone who is manipulative and awful, while the man is just someone who's like who just like wants to win and is super noble.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should subsidize adoptions.
Basically, we think that the state should pay a large portion of the fees that someone incurs when they adopt a child.
Right now, adoption is extremely expensive.
In the US, it can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and we think that it's unacceptable that there's such a high cost to people who are trying to do something that is fundamentally very altruistic and very generous of themselves.
So our first argument is about why adoption is preferable to the alternatives.
So, in some countries, they have lots of use of foster care, where you have a foster family that takes in several foster children and takes care of them until they get adopted or they grow up, and in other countries, you have a greater use of orphanages, which are like group homes for these orphans.
Both of those alternatives are worse than adoption for a few reasons.
From the perspective of the children, they will have a more loving environment if they have parents who care enough to take them in than they would be able to get in a group home.
They'll get more one-on-one attention from their parents, and it's also more likely that they'll be able to succeed in education and to go on into the workplace.
This is true empirically, but also just logically makes sense that if you have parents who love you and are looking out for you, it's likely that they'll be sure that you do your homework and get a job and do internships and things like that, as opposed to if you go to a group home that just kicks you out the day you turn eighteen and leaves you with no way to go to college or get a good education and that sort of thing.
So this is clearly much better for children than having foster homes or orphanages.
It's also much better for the government.
Every expense for these orphan children or these unwanted children at foster homes or orphanages has to be paid by the state, so it's a huge burden on the government per person, whereas once the children are adopted, now they're the responsibility of their parents and all of those costs have been shifted onto the shoulder of their parents.
Now you might say it's very expensive to raise a child so, ultimately, the cost of adoption up front shouldn't really dissuade anyone who can afford to raise these children.
But there's a big difference between spending hundreds of thousands of dollars over the course of eighteen years and having to spend twenty thousand dollars up front to adopt.
We think that that's a very substantial barrier and that, ultimately, it would be better for the children and the state if we were to encourage adoption by removing this barrier.
The next thing we'd like to point out is that, right now, adoption is fairly classist.
It's mostly children of the lower class being put up for adoption because their parents can't or won't take care of them, and then they're being adopted by upper-class people.
But we think that there are plenty of lower-middle-class or working-class families who could and would take care of these children very successfully but, as I mentioned before, who don't have the capital to allocate up front for adoption fees.
So, on our side, we facilitate access to adoption for the working class, and we think that opens up a huge amount of loving families whose parents would put a lot of work into raising these children.
Ultimately, this makes adoption less classist and more accessible to everyone.
And we would tell you that because people have a fundamental right to be parents, this includes working-class people, that we ought facilitate people's ability to be parents.
Ultimately, we do that better when we subsidize adoption.
This also encourages parenthood writ large.
Right now, if you can't have a biological child and you're not very wealthy, there's just nothing you can do about it, so people don't feel like parenthood is that important to them.
But more people would invest their energies into parenthood if they were actually able to become parents, and this would increase their civic investment in things like public schools or opportunities for young people, because it would affect them personally.
Therefore, this would change the political landscape with respect to children.
For all these reasons, we should subsidize adoptions.
Thank you."
"Partial birth abortions.
So before we start the debate, we also want to say that as part of banning this type of abortion, we want to say that if you were to do this, you would also allow more open access to abortion and the first trimester to ensure that women have the option of getting an abortion.
We don't want to ban this type of abortion and additionally ban other types of abortion.
We want to expand the access to others, but we think that this type of abortion isn't justified, and we think it's actively harmful to women and women's rights.
Okay, so first we're going to talk about what justifies abortion and why this doesn't meet that justification, and secondly we're gonna talk about the negative political will associated with partial-birth abortion.
So firstly, on justification.
We think that there are a couple of main justifications for abortion in the status quo.
We think the primary justification is that based on a balancing of rights, abortion should be allowed, that women's bodily autonomy outweighs the fetus's right to life, for the fact that at the time when a woman would have an abortion, a fetus is not viable.
It isn't capable of using its cognizance, it isn't able to make judgments, it isn't able to live outside of the womb of the mother and therefore, is entirely dependent on that mother.
We think that this is an unfair expectation to place on a woman, and we think that there are numerous reasons why a woman might want to have an abortion that are entirely justified and don't mean that she opted into having that child, for example, in cases of rape, in cases where birth control proved ineffective but the woman took all proper steps to ensure that she wouldn't get pregnant.
And we think that a woman's ability to use her bodily autonomy, to choose how her body is going to interact with the world around her and what is going to happen to her body, especially with something as drastic as carrying a child to term and giving birth, we think that this is something that a woman should have full autonomy in making the decision of, especially given the case that early in the early in the pregnancy, a fetus is not capable, is not a viable living creature.
And we think that arguments for potentiality open a paradox in which we give preference to potential creatures, to potential life in all instances, and we make things such as masturbation and things like that and having sex for reasons other than intercourse, we think you would also have to ban those things under a potentiality argument, because all sperm could become a child, all egg could become a child.
And we think that a potentiality argument just leads to a slippery slope.
But we think in the case of a partial birth in the case of late late-term abortions, we don't think that these same arguments hold up.
You're at a point in which the child, the fetus, has become viable and therefore the question is no longer one of potentiality, but one of weighing the right to life that this living creature, this viable creature, has against the rights to bodily autonomy of the woman, especially because if you increase access to abortion other times, we think that the woman has had full capability of expressing her bodily autonomy, has had full has had the full range of time and opportunity to do so and in not choosing to do so earlier, we think the right of the fetus then outweighs the mother in the long run.
Okay, secondly, on political will.
We think that because partial-birth abortions are such a dramatic and kind of visceral thing that can be portrayed in the media by anti-abortion activists and other groups of the like, we think that by banning partial-birth abortion, you're more likely to get political will for other types of abortion.
We think that when people can paint abortions, all abortions, as this kind of viscerally negative thing, it increases political will from those on the fence, from moderates, against abortion for all.
We think that by banning partial-birth abortion, you make it less likely that these types of visceral images are going to come out, less likely that anti-abortion activists are going to be able to paint this as all abortions, and therefore more likely that in the long run, more women are able to express their bodily autonomy than if you keep partial-birth partial-birth abortions as an actual option.
For these reasons, we should ban partial-birth abortions."
"We should limit genetic testing.
So I want to be very clear what this debate is about.
By genetic testing, we mean DNA testing, in particular, but also tests for people's ancestry that might use other methods, such as mitochondrial DNA.
But, ultimately, what we're really looking for is the use of DNA testing for non-medical purposes in this debate.
We don't want to limit anybody's access to this testing if it's medically necessary to see if they have a genetic disease, but we do think that there is an overreliance on genetic testing by courts and by individuals to solve problems that really should be solved in other ways.
So, with that in mind, we have a few arguments for why we think genetic testing is harmful the way it's implemented right now.
Our first argument is about data security and privacy.
Right now, lots of people, in order to find out their ancestry or determine paternity and things like that, take private genetic tests where you mail in a sample of your saliva or blood, and a lab somewhere else in the country decides what your DNA tells them about you.
But also, your DNA is being kept in a database by this lab so that you can make follow-up requests.
What this means is that a huge amount of medical personal data is being stored by these private companies that oftentimes are not held to the same standards that hospitals or universities are when they make use of your data and certainly not to the standard that courts are when they make use of your data.
So we think that there's a high risk that, in the future, hackers will be able to get access to people's personal genetic data and that this could be used to abuse them in the same way that having a copy of someone's fingerprints could theoretically be used for abuse.
For instance, in the future, you might be able to verify that your identity is actually that of someone else by using information about their genetic code.
So we think that there are a lot of potential harms to having all of this data in these databases that are ultimately not held to a very high standard.
But we also think, as part of this argument, that people don't understand the implications of giving away this information.
Joe q public does not have a good idea of what it means to give away information about his genetic code to a private company.
So we don't think that people are able to make an informed decision.
And, ultimately, when people just don't have access to good decision-making, because you would need expert-level scientific knowledge to really appreciate the potential risks and benefits, that's when we think government should get involved in order to prevent people from being taken advantage of.
Our next argument after that data security point is about how some institutions in our society overrely on DNA.
Take courts, for instance.
Oftentimes in court, if DNA evidence turns up that indicates that someone committed a crime, it's seen as a smoking gun and juries will immediately convict someone.
But actually, DNA evidence doesn't always prove what it prosecutors claim that it does.
You might know that someone threw away a kleenex in a particular room where a crime was committed, but that doesn't necessarily prove that someone committed that crime.
And it's pretty rare that DNA evidence is used well.
Oftentimes, it's just used as this kind of magical thing that immediately proves someone is guilty or not guilty when, in fact, that causes us to ignore other evidence that might lead us to the truth.
So we think that the courts are the first institution that routinely misuse DNA evidence and it might be better off having to restrict their use of DNA evidence to very, very certain types of use or very, very certain circumstances.
But moreover, we also think that people rely too much on them for other issues, for instance, paternity.
DNA testing can tell you that two people are related but to my understanding, it's not bulletproof that a private DNA test proves paternity, for instance, even though it's often used that way in our society.
So we think that social solutions to these problems might be better than scientific ones.
So because DNA is often overrelied on, we should limit its use to times when it's really appropriate.
Thank you."
"The affordable care act brings more good than harm for two big reasons: first, the affordable care act is simply a moral bill.
It is a morally good bill to have and secondarily, the affordable care act is good for the economy.
So, first, why is the affordable care act a moral bill?
Let's start by talking about some facts: it's a fact that more people are insured now after the affordable care act was passed than before.
It is particularly true that more of the people insured are more likely to be poor people because of, like, expanded medicaid enrollments and subsidies in lot of cases and expanded access via the exchanges that exist now and additionally, because younger people are allowed to stay on their parents' enrollment plans until a later age than they previously were able to, more young people are more likely to be insured, and third, because people aren't worried about losing coverage because of being discriminated against by corporations because of preexisting conditions.
This means that people those other people are more likely to be covered as well.
But in addition to more people being insured, we're more likely to also see people actually get quality and affordable insurance and the reason for this is because now, because of subsidies that exist, because of regulations that exist on insurance, you're less likely going to see people skip doctors appointments, skip visits, forego medical treatment because they don't think that they can afford it or because their co-pay is going to be too high.
So, this means that at the end of the day, more people are being insured and more people are healthier as a result of this.
So, the impact is that essentially, people are safer and healthier and I think that this is incredibly important because first and foremost, I think this is just the decent, moral thing to do.
I think that when people are in need, when someone is sick, when someone is potentially dying, when someone doesn't have the money to pay for something doesn't have the money to pay for their own health, I think that the health and well-being of someone is such a basic part of living a good and fulfilling life, it is something that is so elementary to your existence, themselves, I think that this is something that people have a right to and it is something that just ought be on face provided to people.
But in addition to this just being the decent thing to do, I think in a lot of ways, the state has a unique responsibility to ensure that its people are healthy and safe because one of the big reasons why a state exists is that the state exists to provide a social safety net for people in a lot of cases when people need help getting and it exists to make sure that people are going to be healthy and that are going to be healthy.
I think this is one of the big reasons why the state exists in a lot of ways because people's health enables because the health of people essentially enables mobility, it enables democracy, it enables their dignity and their worth, it enables a whole lot of things.
People need their health to do essentially anything else in life, so if the state exists for anything, the state exists to provide basic necessities like that.
So, besides it being a moral bill, I also think that the affordable care act is good for the economy and it's good for the economy in two basic ways: first, the way in which it corrects prior strains that exist on the system and second, the way in which it creates positive externalities for the economy.
So, first, the way in which it corrects system strains, I think there's three ways in which it does this: first, by having a mandate of people buying health insurance, people who are healthy, people who may otherwise make a financial decision not to buy insurance, they're now they have to buy insurance.
This means that since there's going to be more healthy people in an insurance pool, you're now going to be able to have insurance companies offer lower rates.
They're not going to have to hike up premiums as much because there's more healthy people in the insurance pool to make up for the less healthy people in the insurance pool.
So, that's a good thing, number one.
It secondarily also led to medicare and medicaid expansions, things that were good for helping the health care of elderly people in medicaid and for poor people that weren't currently.
Third, it also means since you're required by since you're required to give medical treatment to people if they're in an emergency, even if they don't have healthcare coverage, this ensures that the that the average taxpayer isn't footing the bill for these uninsured costs that are existing.
But additionally, there's also very positive externalities that are associated.
Obviously, when people have people are healthier, they're better able to work, people can be workers, they're not there's gonna be more productivity, but also when people are healthy, they can spend money on other things, they can consume more, they have more social mobility because they're healthier, these are all things that are ultimately good for the economy, so, similarly, obamacare did more good than harm."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abandon democracy.
We mean by this is that we prefer a world in which countries rather than being governed by democracy were governed by an oligarch or like some kind of like main singular body that makes the majority of the decisions like obviously we think that oftentimes public will still influences these kinds of rulers we just think there's a difference between having a system that is based in the mechanism of like communication electing your political officials etcetera versus having a system in which you like there is like one main ruling body that chooses whether or not to take the like concerns of people into play.
Three main areas of clash, first on why why democracy precludes systemic change.
Recognize that because collections of people in democracies create institutions that last for years and years and years even after their own terms have expired even when you switch out the individuals in that system the institution that allows certain power cycles to propagate remains.
Like in the united states when the president has disproportionate amount of power over the allocations of the military that's not something that we can change we just hope to god that someone nice is occupying that field.
The problem there is that people are unlikely to advocate for any kind of systematic change because people see their politicians as the arbiters of the problem in these kinds of systems.
So even when we like see a problem occurring the only thing that we do because the only thing we know how to do and the only thing that we imagine being possibly the problem is switch out that elected official and then we're surprised when the same issue propagates over and over and over again.
The difference that occurs with oligarchs or like any kind of nondemocratic regime is that the group in power is also the institution itself so it is way more likely that you are able to overturn the group in power and therefore revamp the entire system than can ever occur in a democracy because in a nondemocratic regime that person is the institution and anyone who replaces them will have a different set of ideals a different way of dealing with the world etcetera etcetera.
So I think that when nondemocratic regimes have systematic flaws it is way more likely that you were able to fix those systematic flaws because you're going to have something like an uprising and shift the entire power dynamic than in a democracy where people just kept telling each other to vote more and change who their political officials are but never target the real problem at hand.
Our second area of clash is about why people are poor arbiters of the good.
No one votes for things like higher taxes, increase spending on schools, things that are incredibly beneficial in the long term but have very little cult like good benefit for people in the short term.
The reason for this is that people don't think into the long term they consider the impacts on themselves and oftentimes of that our most immediate and so they think about like will I have more money in this next coming pay cycle and if the answer is no they do not support that policy because they don't think about the world that they're trying to create and they don't think about people who aren't them.
This is what the republican party is so strong because they're able to tell their constituents like look we just want you to take care of yourself we think that you deserve your earnings etcetera meanwhile thousands and thousands of people starve because we're because we're unwilling to recognize that they need extra support.
So we think that what happens in like in like nondemocratic regimes is that if the that you have one person at the top and if they are a poor arbiter of the good and people are oppressed you have instability and unrest that often leads to the overturning of that individual in the reelection of or like the possession of the throne by someone else and that person is much more likely to be a like better arbiter of the good or else they risk the same.
There's an incentive structure that requires individuals in power to take care of the people who they're governing regardless of the fact they're not democratically elected because they are afraid of being unseated.
So we actually think it's way impair likely that someone who wants their country to thrive is going to do things like have high taxes on people regardless of political will because they see that they have to compete with other countries in the long term but simultaneously they're not going to overlook the underclass because they're afraid that the underclass can grow powerful and overturn them.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish nuclear weapons.
We think this is a normative debate where we would prefer a world without any kind of nuclear weapons ie every country had abolished them like presumably at lick same or similar times.
Three main areas of clash, first about why it's not a power that any state could have or whatever habits use justified.
Recognize that the potential for harm is absurdly high.
Even a small nuke carries that carries like affects cross generationally and across international lines insofar as the waste is both far spreading on things like wind currents but also deep reaching by corrupting individuals DNA and affecting that like which very bases like creates their biology.
Recognize that this harm can literally never be justified in the immediate sense recognize that innocents are always going to be harmed because even if you're attempting to bomb a military base, the nuclear radius affects civilians at all times.
We also think that it's like oftentimes a weapon specifically used against civilians.
I think if we look at the examples of like nagasaki and hiroshima, these were primarily cities that were not war torn and not like particularly heavily involved or influential rather they were just like heavily populated so it really hurt the japanese government.
But even if you don't buy that, it also hurts the future innocents who truly didn't have anything to do with the conflict because maybe opp will come up here and they'll be like but look these people were implicitly responding responsible by supporting the regime the problem then becomes of the children of those individuals were arbitrarily born into a set of circumstances that they never got to mold and never had any control over.
What this means is that they are truly innocent in the sense that they had nothing to do with the conflict and definitely don't deserve to be harmed, but the problem is that because nuclear waste damages DNA that gets passed onto future generations you're necessarily creating a world in which even those innocents are doomed to continue to suffer for whatever had happened in generations previously.
It also just corrupts the general location, I think like we still cannot have housing and cannot have people in the area where chernobyl occurred because the effects are so deep reaching that it was too dangerous for anyone to inhabit that area so like videos taken now show completely wild areas.
So even if you don't buy that it can be very harmful to people, it can wipe out entire areas where people could live as well.
We think that this like shows you that it's a tool that should never be used.
But our second area of clash is about eliminating the risk of destruction.
Recognize the nukes could be useful if they were absolutely controlled.
The problem is that the united states has no way of controlling countries like north korea or russia like less rational groups that could very easily use nukes without considering external harms or not abiding by mutually assured destruction agreements.
I think the fact that like kim jong un's twitter war could literally destroy the world is a risk that is never worth taking under your taking upon yourself and so is like definitely something that we would prefer to avoid even if it means also disadvantaging large western democratic countries like the united states, like england, like like france and so I think like at the point that there's always going to be a group that is uncontrollable and unpredictable we would prefer a world in which they never get a hold of nuclear power.
But our third independent area of clash is about how it creates power imbalances because recognize that no one country auto deserves to be able to exert power over another.
The problem is that nuclear power necessarily creates a massive asymmetry of power where smaller and less militarily advanced countries live under coercive shower shadows of other and bigger countries.
They can be threatened into compliance which shouldn't be allowed.
I think it's like a very big problem the moment like russia can just exert all of this power over the ukraine because they have nuclear power but ukraine doesn't and so they like they have very little bargaining or leveraging power against these larger individuals which is necessarily oppressive and undemocratic.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should abolish needle exchange programs.
Three independent points.
First, needle exchanges increase drug abuse.
This is true for two reasons.
The first being that it decreases the barriers to which are intrinsic in using drugs.
So I think there's a lot of natural disincentives to using drugs, like addiction is bad, there's a lot of money that you blow doing this, it's harms side if like there are health side effects that are pretty bad, but I think generally speaking there is some degree to which people are like, okay but I really like being high and that's worth the trade off to me.
So I think an effective way then to decrease the number of people that are using drugs is to increase the difficulty of engaging it in the first place.
That is this is just a cost benefit analysis that individuals are making and that we can generally speaking say no, like if we make it harder less people will do it.
So needle exchanges then increases simplicity because they decrease the harms intrinsic to reusing needles.
If you make it extremely easy to secure syringes I think that's going to increase the number of people that are willing to abuse drugs in the first place.
But secondly, we think that needle exchange programs will increase drug use because it normalizes it.
When the government engages in a program that says, here we're going to give you the tools that are necessary for engaging in drug abuse, we think that it constitutes a essentially a stamp of approval on the activity itself.
This is problematic because when you normalize this, when the government gives its stamp of approval, you get rid of the most powerful disincentive there is to drug abuse, that is the notion that it is socially unacceptable.
I think generally speaking this is why most people don't engage in drugs in the first place, even if they hear that it's an enjoyable experience.
And if we were to beat back this normalization that it is a bad thing, and instead normalize the notion that it is an acceptable thing to do, that the government will facilitate your attempts to complete, that is a problem and that will increase the number of people doing it.
Our second independent point, that it increase sharps litter.
So when you put more needles into circulation you inevitably wind up with more litter.
This is a problem in cities across the country that have heroin epidemics, that you have people just sort of like leaving sharps on the ground as that use them.
And this is a problem because as the motion slide indicates, there is lots of risk intrinsic to the idea that you are going to have like spread of diseases and things like that.
And when these needles that are just left lying on the ground have traces of HIV and the like on them, someone walking along that either steps on the needle or attempts to pick it up not knowing how to do so properly, risks contracting it.
These are innocent people, people who are in no way associated with the drug with the drug like industry or anything like that.
So we think that it's problematic that when they wind up dealing with harms because we decided we were going to pursue a harm reduction strategy.
Our third independent point is that it's a poor use of government resources.
So note that you are always going to have to spend some amount of money on these types of programs, that you have to buy the needles, you have to pay a staff, you have to like rent the building.
Like needle exchange programs aren't a cheap thing and we think that there's just significantly better things that you can do that don't have these harmful side effects.
Like insofar as public health commission's tend to have finite budgets that they can only spend on one thing or another, we prefer systems that provide like mental health counseling or you know provide like anti-advocacy campaigns about like explaining why drugs are bad.
Things like that.
Like going into schools and educating children on the harms that are to come.
We think that you can get a lot of the same effects that are being professed by what I'd side opposition will tell you, without having to deal with the harmful side effects of having a needle exchange program.
Proud to propose."
"We should ban fracking because fracking is horrible for the environment, and it's going to be horrible for well so it's bad for the environment in the short term, it's gonna be bad for the environment in the long term, and it's also bad for people in the short term and the long term.
So all of these those things are bad.
So, let's start by why it's really bad for the environment in the short term.
These things are really obvious.
When you look at the data of like seismic disturbances in places where fracking is happening, places like pennsylvania, places like north dakota, you start to see an alarming trend emerge.
And this trend is that places that aren't on active fault lines, places that aren't really known for having any kind of particular history of seismic activity are suddenly seeing like micro earthquakes and sometimes even major earthquakes.
These plays are seeing like sinkholes, these places are seeing all kinds of like clear signs of environmental contamination and environmental destruction.
And these kinds of things have a huge impact on people in the sense that like when there's like a like a earthquakes in places where they aren't usually happening or where there're sinkholes that are happening that just like randomly, and these can be be massive sinkholes, that can swallow up people's houses.
Obviously those are really critical problems.
But when you look at it in a broader sense too, the picture that fracking paints isn't any less dire.
Because when you're injecting chemicals into the ground, injecting chemicals into wells that people oftentimes draw water from, when you're injecting chemicals into the ground that ultimately then when there's rain results in runoff, which goes into local food supplies, local water supplies, and all other kinds of things, what you end up seeing is you see widespread contamination.
You see the very same aluminum alloys and sands that are getting injected into the earth ultimately end up in like water that can get and like absorbed by food.
And that happens because like once you put something into the ground, you can't just accept that you can't just expect it to sit there under the earth.
That's not the way the environment works.
There's things are oftentimes like moving around, constantly being moved around by forces like wind, rain, earth moves like earth movement in itself, and other kinds of natural forces.
So all of these kinds of pollutions eventually end up in like ultimately hurts humans as well.
This is the same way in like, for example, when you like put lead somewhere, and like the lead it like obviously if you're not if you're like in like just like around lead, that can be really harmful for you.
In the same way, that's like a big problem with like other kinds of chemicals that we commonly use in humans for humans.
Because when these things get absorbed into our food, whether it's like an aluminum alloy or whatever the hell they put into these chemicals that they use to break up rock, literally chemicals that break up rock can be seeping into our food supply.
I don't think that's something that sounds very good to any reasonable, thinking person.
But besides all of those other kinds of impacts, let's look beyond that to the impact this has in the longer term, the impact that this has on global warming, and the impact that this has on our ability to convert over to a cleaner economy.
And I think that this is really bad as well.
Because we're investing such large quantities of money in the fracking boom essentially that when we put all of this upfront investment into fracking, it's definitely going to keep being cheaper to do fracking.
It'll be keep being cheaper to rely on fossil fuels and other kind of polluting fuels as opposed to green technologies, and the big reason for that is because instead of investing in better green technologies, we're funneling all this money into better ways to break apart the earth and just and get chemicals into the earth so we can get oil out of it.
So for all those reasons, we should absolutely ban fracking to help combat global warming, to help combat food contamination and pollution, and to help combat the like horrible seismic consequences that come with it.
So for all those reasons, ban fracking."
"We should increase tax credits.
Tax credits are when instead of providing direct cash transfers through welfare, we excuse individuals' tax burden due to the amount of work they do or due to the amount of money that they make.
It's incredibly effective at actually inspiring people to go to work more effectively and ultimately, it is incredibly valuable for our economy.
With that in mind, we would propose the following model: that the vast majority of welfare spending be transferred to tax credits instead, primarily earned income tax credits where the more you work, the harder you work, the more of these tax credits you get, based on your income.
So if you're still not making much money but working incredibly hard, you're going to get more of these tax credits and they're going to be far more effective.
Three arguments for why this is a good idea: first, we think that the marginal rate of taxation will largely decrease.
In the status quo, there's very little incentive for someone in a high welfare area to continue working.
If I can essentially do nothing and get a lot of money, it's just logical that I wouldn't work very hard.
Even in systems where we require people to apply for jobs consistently or to have a job every six months, it's very easy to apply to jobs but not try very hard or to simply get a job and not try very hard either: skip work, don't do anything and get fired again, and continue to get these sort of welfare dollars.
Earned income tax credits and other forms of tax credits are far more effective because people have to earn an income in the first place to get this sort of benefit.
If they are earn an income, if they start to work harder at the job that they get, we think that they'll actually: one, be more inspired to work harder and just earn more money, but also the marginal rate of taxation will decrease.
This means that the harms of me working more, the harms of me finding a better job are less costly to me and my family and as such, I'll be inspired to work harder.
My second argument is that it's politically popular.
Democrats massively support increased money going to the poor through increased tax credits.
We think that they particularly support people like those who work at walmart or work at other low-paying industries where they simply can't afford to buy a house or afford to have an apartment, yet they still work forty hour work week.
Republicans are very fond of this plan because they're not a huge fan of direct cash transfers to people in poverty, however, they do support tax cuts, they do support tax credits as well.
As such, we think that more money will go into the system as there'll be bipartisan support for increased tax credits, increased spending to improve tax credits, which will largely help the poor.
We think that there's a government obligation to help the poorest in our society as they have, one: been the people who we have largely depended on for cheap labor for a massive amount of time.
They're the reason that we were able to spend incredibly cheaply and largely prop up our capitalist system, but two: many are simply victims of the lottery of birth.
They did not choose to be in poverty.
They did not choose what their parents would have and as such, we think that they're victims of circumstance who deserve more money than they are currently getting.
My third and final argument is this provides more control to the government.
Having more tax credits means that we are far more easily able to alter particular actions.
We can provide tax credits for renewable resources.
We can provide tax credits for people shopping responsibly, shopping sustainably, ultimately provides the government far more autonomy than actually telling individuals how best to cater their to their community, how best to actually help the people around them.
We think the government's fairly effective in this role given that they are able to take a large-level picture of what's actually necessary.
At the same time, we think that many individuals are simply on the edge of spending responsibly or spending on good products, and providing these sort of tax credits both rewards people who have already spent money into renewable or sustainable resources while also incentivizing people to enter this market now.
For this reason, we should increase tax credits."
"Physical education should be mandatory.
We think that physical education should be mandatory in grades k through twelve all across the developed world and we think that federal funding for this should be given directly to schools to ensure that they can have strong physical education programs.
These classes would take place daily.
They'd probably take place for half an hour to an hour every day depending on what local look like authorities and school figures decide was appropriate.
But we think that there are immense benefits that can come from this.
It's important at the very top of this debate to recognize that there's a massive obesity epidemic that currently exists in the developed world.
In the developed world there are numerous different distractions types things that happen online and numerous amounts of different media platforms that children can turn and children do turn to on a daily basis that keep them from going outside that keep them from getting their daily activity.
And this is crucial because for a healthy human being scientists recognize that it is important that people get about thirty minutes of at least moderate activity every day in order to ensure that human development takes place at the progressive rate that it needs to to ensure that people are as healthy as they need to be to ensure that people are building strong muscles building strong bones all these types of things that are important for good physical health are tied with thirty minutes of moderate exercise every day.
Recognize that in a world in which we don't have mandatory physical education we think it is the case that for the vast majority of students in k through twelve most of these children will not get that type of activity every day.
Which means that students are not getting what they need to be successful in their lives.
The primary purpose of education is to ensure that students get these types of things build the proper habits learn the types of lessons that can insure that they succeed in the future.
We think that having mandatory physical education allows for students to build healthy habits by going through by going through physical education for a long period of one's life from ages five to seventeen on a daily basis we think it we think it ensures that students start to build those daily habits they start to become normalized to the idea of exercising everyday they become normalized to having themselves do these types of things they learn different types of exercises.
They learn how to keep themselves physically fit and they learn how to do it in a safe manner involving things like stretching and how to properly exercise in such a way so that you don't harm yourself.
All these things are things that can be taught in the physical education classroom.
And we think are crucial for one's development in the long run.
We think that by forming these healthy habits in childhood you're much more likely to breed adults that are willing to do these things in the long run and therefore make the population overall more healthy.
We also think that it is just beneficial to classroom education traditional classroom education to have mandatory physical education for very young children that have things such as ADHD and ADD diseases that are incredibly high in the developed world are incredibly common in the developed world.
We think that's important for these people to be able to use that excess energy that they have to have a positive outlook for that type of energy to be able to use their activity for physical education for physical health and for physical well being and we think that it ensures that those children are more easily able to focus in the classroom when they have that outlet that they know is going to come during their school time.
Furthermore we think that by having this type of outlet this type of period for all students it's a means of having some sort of stress relief during the school day a normalized form of stress relief that is a healthy form of stress relief that ensures that students are more likely to be focused when they enter the classroom.
We think that there are numerous studies that show a connection between having physical well being and being mentally healthy having the ability to take in information the ability to be productive in class and in the work space and the ability to have emotional well being as well and feeling better about yourself on a day to day basis the studies show that physical education is a is a necessity for a healthy populace and we think it's the government's obligation to fulfill that and for these reasons physical education should be mandatory."
"We should ban organic food.
When we're talking about organic food we mean foods that apply certain standards ecological balance conserve biodiversity in their area as well as abstain from using certain pesticides and fertilizers in their farming, so why do we think that you should ban organic food?
Firstly, we think that there is a false advertising that comes with domestic food that also that immediately leads to a market loss because of the higher price that is being paid for these food.
There's no scientifically proven advantage to organic food.
There's no reason that organic food is necessarily more healthy for you, nor is it necessarily more likely to get the vitamins and nutrients that you need in a healthy life.
Organic food in the status quo is a label that individual companies are able to put on to their foods often without the regulation of the governments that provide these labels in the first place, so there are often countries, there are often systems by which farms can apply the organic label put into market without actually meeting the standards of organic food.
We think that you need to get additional oversight that also even when you do have these organic foods that are legitimate, when they have to get the additional oversight that leads them getting use labels of approval, it leads to higher prices being paid by consumers because there's regulation, there's regulation fees and other types of things that corporations and small farms need to pay in order to get approved and to get an actual label as organic food, which means that individuals are paying an ultimately higher price both because of the drive for organic food in the status quo but also because of the regulatory process going into it, when there's no scientifically proven benefit to organic food.
The second problem with organic food is that by not using pesticides and other types of things like this you lead to a wider spread of disease.
Why is this the case?
Pesticides exists to ensure that bugs and other insects can't pollute the can't pollute the vegetables and the other types of things that are growing on these farms.
And what this means is that that when you don't use these types of pesticides but when you have the allowance of organic foods being widely distributed in our markets it leads to a more likely chance that disease is going to be spread through these foods, which means that not only are you not getting organic food when you buy this type of thing you're not getting the health benefits that are supposed to be advertised but you're actually more likely to get sick from the organic foods that exist.
Why does the government have the right to ban in this instance?
We think that when there's a market failure and a asymmetry of information that exists in the market.
We think the government exists to step in and ensure that these asymmetries of information can be balanced, because individuals don't understand that organic food labels are often improperly applied and more often that the organic food simply doesn't have the benefit that is being advertised from these corporations and from these farms.
We think that the government has a right to ensure that its people are not falling for the falling for the false advertising that exists.
We also think that organic food tends to block out poor and underprivileged individuals and when more farms are striving to get the organic label because the craze exists to be an organic producer, we think what this means is that you have fewer producers producing cheaper cheaper foreign goods and cheaper vegetables, fruits, the types of things that ensure good nutrition for individuals, which means that given that healthy food is already often overpriced and out priced for lower economic classes we think that that only perpetuates even further when you allow the spread of the organic craze that exists in our society today to continue to go on, which means that nutrition nutrition failings in these sections of society are only likely to get worse, and we don't think that the government should stand idly by while that happens.
Given that organic food itself is no better than any other type of farmed food scientifically and that there's no and that the existence of the organic label allows for massive market failures and for the failures of protecting the lowest amongst us in our society, we think that you should ban organic food."
"We should abolish congressional earmarks.
In the status quo, congress people are able to add amendments and other provisions to larger spending bills that are unrelated to the bills that exist that are that allow for spending to be done on very specified programs.
So, most federal government spending comes in the form of block grants where individual locales are able to make decisions about how they're going to spend the money, but congressional earmarks allow for smaller but more specified money to go to different regions and what this usually looks like is congress people getting small infrastructure development and business projects for their region for their specific community in particular so they can go home and say to their constituents, look at what I did, give them something tangible to look at.
So we think congressional earmarks fall directly counter to the purpose of the federal government and are simply undemocratic.
So firstly, why they're undemocratic.
Let's look at the process in which earmarks are passed.
Earmarks are attachments to bills that get the brunt the full brunt of focus by individuals, by politicians, by the media, during our political discourse.
We think that what this means is that these earmarks which, over the course of an entire year spending in fiscal bills add up to a substantial amount of money, never get the scrutiny that the larger bill will receive, and we think that this is crucial.
We think that, this money comes from taxpayers that the federal government is spending the country's money on very localized projects, and if it's going to try and do something that has a localized effect, we think that should be facing more scrutiny than the average bill, that it should have to pass the muster of a higher level of scrutiny to show that it is a necessary and sufficient project that the money is being used most efficaciously and most efficiently in these respects.
Because if it's not, and you're spending money on individuals at a very localized level, you're essentially taking money from other people for the gain of a very small minority, and you're doing it in a way that doesn't particularly help people.
So given that the scrutiny doesn't exist, we think this falls antithetical to what the government's supposed to do.
It doesn't allow for political discourse to occur, it doesn't allow for individuals who are elected to make to have a discourse about whether or not this is going to be something that we accept, whether or not each individual earmark is going to be acceptable, and we think it ultimately leads to worst congresspeople.
When people are able to simply put an earmark in for a local project and report back to their districts and say look at what I did for you and not have to deal with what their record is on any number of other issues, we think what this leads to is people get distracted from what the real issues are at stake, especially at the federal level.
Localized projects can be done and funded at state level, they can be funded through block grants, there are ways to get this work done without using earmarks.
But using earmarks is, we think, a way, a means of distraction from important political discourse, and a means of distraction for the constituents.
Secondly, on why we think this is fundamentally bad government.
So, the federal government as I've already pointed out draws its money from a number of people.
We don't think it's the job of the federal government to dictate localized projects.
We don't think the federal government has, one, a good understanding of what localized regions need, because they simply do not live in those regions, they don't know what the infrastructure is like, they're not familiar with the economics of these regions, while congress people may be, congresspeople as unilateral decision makers shouldn't be choosing how thousands millions of dollars are going to be spent in the first place.
We think that it's best left for local governments to make local decisions, that it's best left in the most knowledgeable hands to make these decisions, and for funding to come in other forms.
We don't think that earmarks are necessary to a well functioning federal government, and we think they in fact detract from how well our government is able to function.
And because of this, we should abolish congressional earmarks."
"Opt socialism.
So in this debate we're going to have three broad topics.
We're going to talk about just governance, fairness, and why the current system is simply unsustainable.
But first we're going to lay out a model as to what we think this looks like because socialism is a fairly broad term and we think it needs to be defined.
So firstly we would say that we would have a system of substantially substantial redistribution of wealth via high taxation on the very rich and redistribution of this wealth through welfare programs potentially a universal basic income as well as other systems that ensure that this income can be redistributed to the masses.
Secondly, we would say public ownership of all utilities and mass goods.
So this includes everything that ranges from electricity, plumbing, sewage, these types of things all the way to things like internet connection and broadband access, we wouldn't share that all of these things are publicly owned, so things that are necessities for people to live standard of living that is acceptable for a modern time.
We would say all those businesses would be publicly owned.
And thirdly, we would say for all the rest of free market enterprise, this market would be heavily regulated to ensure both worker protection and to ensure that prices align with the actual value of good.
So for example, in the current pharmaceutical industry goods are often vastly overpriced compared to their production costs.
We would ensure that regulation keeps those prices down.
Ok.
So firstly on just governance.
We would say that the state is essentially a course of actor insofar as people are fairly unable to consent to the state.
You can sort of consent through voting and through other systems, but you don't really have a choice over whether or not you're going to be a part of a state.
And for the vast majority of people they're just kind of stuck in the state that they're born into.
And given that this is the case, we think the only way that that state can be fair is is is to ensure that it is representative of all people.
We think the current system doesn't do this.
We think the current system is mostly favored towards the richest people in society and we think that the current system also forces people to work in a labor system in which they have no choice, for the most part, about whether or not they want to be part of that labor system and their decisions are ultimately motivated by the need for survival.
We don't think that people should be coerced into the labor system in this way and we think that socialism provides a system of governance and a system of economics that is most broadly beneficial to the most people.
Secondly, on fairness.
We think that in the status quo labor is improperly valued.
A worker at a mcdonald's can make as little as seven dollars an hour in the united states, and the CEO of mcdonald's will be making billions of dollars a year and we simply don't think that the disparity in the amount of work and training is equivalent to that actual distribution of labor costs or to that distribution of income.
We simply think that the current system does not value traditional labor in the way that it should and we think a socialist system could make up for this by regulating income levels by ensuring public public ownership of businesses in which large amounts of people are employed etcetera.
We think that all people deserve a fair standard of living no matter where they were born and no matter what system or economic class they're born into, and we think socialism can allow for that.
And finally, we think the current system is simply doomed.
While free market capitalism was effective during the industrial revolution in a time when job growth was exceeding or at least close to the population growth of any given state, this simply isn't the case anymore.
In the status quo, automation is not creating new jobs while at the same time stripping jobs from a large number of individuals and in the near future job growth is not going to out pace population growth and is in fact going to decline steadily.
Given that this is the case, we think capitalism is the normal system won't work when there aren't enough consumers to consume the vast amount of increase of productivity, the increase of goods.
We think that the current system is fundamentally unbalanced and we think that a socialist system can ensure that consumers can continue to consume and that the vast majority of individuals who are not amongst the wealthiest in our society are able to have a substantial and a positive standard of living.
And for these reasons we should adopt socialism."
"We should end mandatory retirement.
So in this debate we have two main arguments.
The first is about why age based restrictions are essentially problematic, and the secondly is about why it's unfair to workers.
So firstly on age based restrictions.
It's important to recognize that age is always an arbitrary line.
You cannot simply say that all sixty five year olds have certain capabilities and all forty five year olds have certain qualifications and that this is always a universal truth.
That is simply not the case that age is a good approximation for other types of qualities, which means if you set an arbitrary line at when at which someone needs to retire, we think that you're judging all people based on a stereotype and based on a metric that is simply untrue.
We think that arbitrary delineations should not be a part of public policy and that rather other metrics are preferable.
And that's the second thing that is important to recognize, is that age in these types of discussions is always just an approximation for something else.
In this case, it's an approximation for competency and about an approximation of skill, about whether or not someone is actually qualified and capable of serving in their role.
But you can still test for those things in a market that doesn't have mandatory retirement.
Businesses can still phase out workers once they become no longer productive enough to meet bare minimum requirements of a labor and you can still create competitions in the workplace to ensure that people that are no longer skilled cannot serve in the role.
But to say that at age sixty five, or whatever age you set, all people lose the ability to produce and to be effective laborers we think is simply a stereotype and nonsensical.
Yes it is probably true that there are some people that once they hit a certain age are not capable of being productive workers.
But mandatory retirement phases out skilled workers in addition to unskilled workers.
It ends up being a net loss to corporations when otherwise you could simply phase out those that are unskilled and allow those that are still quality employees to work.
We think that you're lessening your labor base and you remove qualified and knowledgeable workers and replace them with workers that are less familiar with the job, less familiar with the company, people that don't have the experience to do the job in the same quality way that people with vast experience those that are retiring are likely going to be able to do.
Alright secondly on why this is unfair to workers.
We think that there are two possibilities of these mandatory retirees.
The first is that they still need money.
They simply don't have the funds to retire and they still need to work.
Well when you force mandatory retirement on them their skills are often nontransferable so they can't just go to another corporation because they have to compete with the younger workforce that otherwise is going to that is going to provide more long term assets to a company and is a better investment for training and things like that.
And oftentimes these people simply don't have the assets to go and acquire new training which means that people that need to work end up being forced into low skilled labor jobs which I think is an inefficient use of their experience, their knowledge, and their worldly time that they spent in any sort of corporate or other job position that they're being forced out of.
We think that this is unfair to workers and we think that if you need to maintain yourself in a job, if you need to continue to work and you have the skill to do so, you should be allowed to do so.
Finally, it is also possibly the case that you don't need to work but because you've been working in a job for so long, your job provides you with meaningful fulfillment.
Again in these cases if you are qualified enough to work, we think it is unfair and irresponsible to strip these people of something that provides them with such fulfillment as a job that they've been invested in for many, many years.
Because age based restrictions are arbitrary and because there are legitimate reasons people may still want to work, we should end mandatory retirement."
"We should prohibit international adoption.
So what we're talking about in this debate is largely going to be people in wealthy countries like britain or america adopting children from less wealthy countries like sudan or china.
We think that this should be prohibited by the governments of the less wealthy countries where these children would be adopted from.
We're agnostic about the laws in the more wealthy country where the parents would be located.
Three arguments for our side this evening.
First, international adoption is a major cause of the loss of human capital.
Recognize that the children who are being adopted to other countries would otherwise have stayed and worked in their home country.
So if your say sudan and you have thousands of children being adopted by europeans and americans, those are children who later don't go on to work in your economy.
So we think that international adoption ultimately means that you lose out on workers, on students, on people who could contribute to your society.
Therefore it's in your best interest to prohibit this practice so that those people remain and contribute to the growth of your own country.
This is particularly true when you have children being adopted who are part of a minority ethnic group.
For instance if you had one tribe that disproportionately had children being adopted by americans or europeans we think it's likely that that group would face undue harm from this adoption process because they would lose out on even more human capital relative to the rest of the population.
So we think that there's a compelling interest to prevent these children from being adopted abroad so that they remain and work for their community and their country which ultimately will make everyone in the country better off due to the capital that they provide through their labor.
Our second argument is that we think this commodifies and fetishizes the adopted children.
What we mean by this is that a huge business is going to rise up around international adoption.
We see this is already the case between countries like russia and america.
There are a lot of businesses which exist to help americans adopt russian babies.
What this means is that the children aren't being treated as individuals by the adoption agency.
They're a source of money and all of the children are kind of lumped in as interchangeable as long as it ultimately makes the adoption agency money.
Since the parents most often never meet the children before they travel or before the children are sent to america or to europe, that means that they are dehumanized and not treated as individuals.
Matches are made between children and parents without any consideration of the individual needs of these children because the companies are basically profit seeking and just see them as a source of money.
At that point we think that the adoptions that are made are going to be poor matches and that many of these children will end up being sent back to their home country and feeling abandoned or put into homes that are not loving and supportive.
It would have been better in that case to keep them in their home country we think where the very least the community is more likely to be supportive.
Our third argument is about the harms that international adoption does to domestic children.
And I guess here we're thinking about the considerations you would have to take in the wealthier country and why we think it's wrong to have these international adoptions.
Recognize that the main driver of international adoptions is not that there's a shortage of orphans or foster children in america or in europe, it's that people only want to adopt small babies.
They don't want to adopt older children because there are stereotypes that those children have behavioral issues or because they want to mold these babies in their own image.
What that means is that because there is a huge pool of babies internationally, older children in these countries don't get adopted who otherwise would have if there were no babies available.
Because people would still adopt, they would just have to adopt older children at that point.
So we think that this is grossly unfair to those children who then lose out on the ability to have a family, to be adopted and to live a better life.
So for these reasons we should prohibit international adoption.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should limit the right to self defense.
We mean by this is that currently there's like this very nebulous line in which people can say that they felt threatened or had like a perception of a threat and get away with like claiming the right to self defense when they caused someone else harm.
We think this needs to be stricter standard, it can't just be I felt threatened rather they have to demonstrate a real threat via like real violence occurring or some weapon being involved or some intent on the part of the individual that shows that there was a real threat rather than just a perceived threat.
Two main areas of clash, first on adressing police brutality and other racial biases.
There's a problem in the status quo where because of racial stereotyping and biases certain groups of people are automatically perceived to be more of a threat ie a white person in the same situation and occupying the same space as a black person is much much less likely to be seen as threatening or assumed to have had like some kind of violent or dangerous desires.
For example a black child was shot like two years ago when holding a toy gun because the police thought like confused it for a real one and just shot at them.
The problem here is that had this child been white the same kind of threshold for this is a threat would never have been reached because it would have been way more higher.
We think this is really problematic because it's completely based on the color of a person's skin and the way that they are perceived in society and given that it is society that has created this perception of black youth being thugs and people of color being more likely to commit crimes eventhough this is not this is not true and in the situations where it is it is based again in societal like shoving them into poor areas and being awful.
We think that this is like very problematic.
People don't regulate themselves when they feel like the law will absolutely protect them.
There's no incentive to check before you shoot or like put your hand finger in a different place so that you don't get trigger happy because you know that if you do you can just claim self defense and move on, so you don't you like choose to be risk averse for yourself.
This is especially relevant with police because they hold so much power over individuals in society and have so much protection from the government that allows them to do disproportionate amount of harms and it's impossible to target them specifically without backlash so this kind of broad legislation would be especially helpful in like affecting both the common person but especially affecting police so that you have less like thin blue line protests where they're like oh you're especially shitting on police.
Our second area of clash is about balancing the protection of individual rights.
Just as there is a right to self defense, people also have a right to life.
The problem occurs when the two start to encroach on each other such in a situation where someone feels like that right to life is threatened and so takes away someone else's life in the process.
But I think that these kinds of things need to be imagined in terms of threshold like we think that at the point that one person feels threatened but it comes at the risk of the life of another person when the first person was never in any danger in the first place we probably value that person who just got shot life a lot more.
So yeah this is a balancing act but recognize that there isn't an absolute right to self defense insofar as it gives a disproportionate amount of power to individuals over other people's rights.
And if the the we need to prevent the misuse and so it needs to be limited and so there's like no other way for the government to control these kinds of things because there's no way for someone else to be present in every single situation where this is necessary to be viewed.
This is similar to the freedom of speech.
Slander and libel aren't protected because it encroaches on other people's rights eventhough technically they're just forms of speech that technically are like free if we believe in an absolute freedom of speech but we recognize that sometimes other people's rights outweigh those of those of some and so we think this is a very similar situation where like maybe this is where it like me having to check twice is very unlikely to affect me but could cause someone else their life.
Proud to propose."
"We should privatize ports.
Two main arguments: first, on the efficiency of the free market.
Recognize that running ports is literally just a game of efficiency.
It's about organizing freights in ships when they are parked in place.
It's about creating an efficient schedule so that you don't have boats coming in too close to each other, but you also don't have large gaps of time without any activity that boats could have been going past each other.
It's about maintaining spaces that are separate for boats that are just parked there long term, so just tour boats.
It's about managing the prices for those kinds of things versus the ones that are actually carrying freight.
All of this is something that we just think is too much for government bureaucracy, especially since there's never an incentive for government bureaucracy to make the most efficient and high functioning port if your paycheck doesn't rely on it.
Government civil servants end paid the same either way, regardless of the bottom line, which means you can be literally the worst port manager in the world and still receive government benefits and whatever salary you were promised at the beginning.
For private corporations, every extra ship, every minimization of inefficiency, will personally make that individual more money as the port manager or, at least, build them up in terms of reputation so they don't lose their jobs and, better yet, so they can get promoted in to the long term.
This it what creates strong businesses that can contribute positively to the economy, and we think that when the government takes over these kinds of opportunities, it is doing both itself and the general populace a disservice.
Insofar as private corporations can handle this best, we think the government should not waste its time on it, especially since this is often something that is expensive both financially and energetically.
So, we actually just think that outsourcing this to another company would be best.
Our second argument is about preventing politicization of ports.
As globalization increases, dependence on trade and international communication is growing.
Especially we see that there are different private companies that are stationed in different countries that rely on loose trade barriers and strong essentially like ocean pathways and air pathways to make sure that they continue to function.
Ports are necessary to those kinds of things and to the agreements that they create, and we think that when they are publicly owned, the government can choose to shut them off in times of political turmoil and selectively use them to punish or reward specific countries that they might let in or not let in anymore.
Even if it is the case the country chooses not to do that, we think the perception that it could is the kind of thing that adds enough risk so that private corporations are uncomfortable with being in that country or using that port in the first place, because there are other countries that are less risky, where ports are private and things like that.
This is incredibly bad for the economy because ports tend to be profit producing.
Using them as political tools prevents them from taking the most efficient actions that would be best for society, since you often have to choose between satisfying politics and being economically efficient: for example, middle eastern countries' refusal to trade with israel, even though they're incredibly economically beneficial to their own people given that israel has a lot of technology and a lot of things like agriculture that would be good to share.
But and we think that it's even worse to extend that kind of decision-making to things like ports, first, because it just puts people's jobs on hold at random moments, but also because your country's just less likely to get get invested in, and third, because it does thing like things like allows crony capitalism to come in.
Giving high level jobs just to someone just because they're your friends or friends of the state is exactly the kind of thing that happens when you when bureaucracies get to control things that should be privately owned.
And even though it can happen in private corporations as well, it's not nearly as likely, given the fact that that person actually has to be good at their job so they don't use the lose the corporation money.
Proud to propose."
"We should subsidize public transportation.
So by subsidize we mean we think that government should subsidize fares, make them cheaper than they would be otherwise by paying part of the cost.
Government should build and expand transit systems whenever possible, and government should pursue campaigns to promote ridership.
And when we say public transit we meet things like metro's, city buses, light rail, trams, all that good stuff that everybody loves.
We think that these subsidies might be drawn from a tax levied on the area that the public transit system serves.
So but that in mind, we have two big arguments.
The first is environmental.
Obviously there's a trade off between the cost of the subsidy and the reduction in CO two emissions and other environmental harms.
Having everybody in a city, like boston, drive to work in their own car doesn't make a whole lot of sense from an environmental perspective.
You have everybody in a vehicle that holds four or five people and it's very inefficient because everyone's admitting enough CO two to get five people to work, but only getting one person there.
So you're doing a huge amount of harm for relatively little benefit when people drive their own car.
Certainly people can carpool, but we think it's unlikely that most people will ever fill all five seats of their car both ways to work day in and day out.
We think therefore that the best way to reduce CO two emissions is to encourage people to use a more efficient vehicle.
The cost of running a bus isn't that much greater than the cost of running a large car, or perhaps even if it is compared to the number of people who write it it's much lower.
So the per capita CO two emissions are going to be much much lower with public transit.
We think therefore that this is a good subsidy because it's an investment in the future.
Less CO two release now means fewer expensive problems due to climate change in the future.
We think it's likely that technology will help us to mitigate climate change in the future.
But why make that job more difficult and more expensive by continuing to drive?
We think that's very irresponsible.
So perhaps the benefits seem intangible now, but we think that over the long term, these benefits are clear and they come down heavily in favor of subsidized public transit.
On top of that, public transit encourages the construction of infrastructure that doesn't rely on the use of cars.
If you visit some cities in america it's impossible to get anywhere without a car.
They're too big an area to walk around cities like LA, for instance, so you have to drive to get everywhere.
If cities are based around public transit then they're more likely to be built at a human scale so that in the future, when people don't drive as much, they'll actually be able to get around the city by, I don't know, using their own two legs, or a bike, or taking the bus if they decide that's what they want to do, but everyone won't be completely reliant on cars as they often are right now due to car based development that we think is economically and environmentally unsustainable.
So our second point is about the broader economic impacts aside from the environment.
Cities are always in competition to attract business.
Every big city in the world is competing with every other big city in their region, in their country, even globally in some cases, to attract businesses and workers.
So how do you make your city an attractive place to do business?
We think that world class public transit is a good way to do this.
If you think about a city like london, it's impossible to think about it without thinking of the underground.
You can get anywhere in london, one of the world's greatest cities, using only public transit.
It's easy to get around.
It's pretty cheap.
It's overall a very pleasant system to use.
We think that because london, even though its sprawling and massive, is relatively accessible with shorter commutes than you would expect given its enormous size, and that this is because of public transit that ultimately public transit helps a city like london to attract business and tourists.
Now the other team might say london already has lots of businesses, but we think that the comparative for a smaller city, like one in the north of england, like york, might be that they're better able to compete because people can access the same sort of comforts of transportation in new york now as well as the lower cost of doing business, so you're more competitive with a larger city like london.
At the end of the day, therefore, we think it's more likely that your city will continue to grow and develop and be prosperous if you subsidize public transportation.
So for these reasons we think subsidizing public transportation is a very good idea.
Thank you."
"Covenant marriage brings more good than harm, because it strengthens the bonds and institutions of marriage himself and it makes them a whole lot more meaningful, and second, it's also better for children, it's better for the health of the family as a whole, which I think is very important.
So, let's start by talking about strengthening the institution of marriage.
Because I think it's important to recognize that we don't necessarily think that marriage is for everyone, especially in like a modern day society.
It's not everyone's not everyone wants to be tied down, not everyone should be tied down in marriage.
So I think that when you make marriage more binding, more difficult to actually get out of, it makes people more unwilling to opt into marriage in the first place.
So, that's like the first way in which you directly decrease rates of divorce and decrease disillusions of a family unit and all of the harms that can be associated with, which I'm going to talk about later.
And I think that it's fine, not everyone needs to get married, but the people who do get married should take that should take that marriage, take that on a whole lot more seriously than they do.
So, after that, why do I think that this is necessarily going to lead to a strengthening of the bonds of marriage, and why do I think that's good.
So, obviously, having divorce be a much more difficult option is going to make it a lot more difficult to you you're stuck with the person because of this.
So, that means you're necessarily going to see more of an emphasis on things like counseling, like marital counseling, you're going to see more of an emphasis on problem solving, and like a conflict resolution, as opposed to conflict.
And all of those things are good, because I think that that means that you're going to be more likely to stay with the person.
And that also means that the institution of marriage is a strong thing themselves.
I think that from an emotional standpoint, this can be very powerful, because while marriage may not be for all people, I think that for some people, marriage can be quite quite quite good.
And it's quite good because it gives you the ability to like essentially put like the ultimate faith and the ultimate trust in another person.
It's the ultimate feeling of connection and closeness with another person, which on a basic emotional level is very important.
Like pretty much like any human you ask does like want to feel connected to other people, does strive for like that kind of an intimacy, and marriage gives you that opportunity, and the stronger those marriage bonds are, the stronger that that sense of intimacy and closeness is going to feel.
You're not going to be fighting with the person, you're not gonna feel like you're going to need to keep secrets from the person, all those things, so I think that's going to make your marriage better.
But second and more importantly, I think that this strengthens the institutions associated with marriage, like the family and the health for children themselves.
And why do I think that that's very important?
Because divorce sucks for children.
Divorce can, for children, can have a lot of like very bad emotional outcomes, especially if if it's a messy divorce, where their parents are fighting a lot, where they're forced not to see one parent a whole lot of the times, where it can be very stressful to have to frequently travel and move all of your stuff every other week to be with the other parent, even if they are close enough to stay with them.
Like so all of those things are bad, it makes you feel less emotionally stable in like the household name that you're growing up in, you're going to feel like less willing to talk to your parents, you're going to feel like your family is a lot more damaged and it's not gonna feel like as like open of a space, you're maybe you're goona be more likely to feel like isolated or away from it.
You know what, all of these things are possible, all of these things happen to children, and all of those things are very very bad and not things that you want to incentivize.
So, for all those reasons, covenant marriage brings more good than harm."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should protect the right to internet access.
What we mean by this is the government ought not be able to infringe on people's internet access so you can't have situations such as north korea where certain websites are banned, or like the people who can own computers are regulated we think that every single person has a right to free internet access unregulated by the government.
Two main areas of clash, the first on protecting freedom of speech.
We we think that both sides are going to accept that freedom of speech is a tenant of democracy insofar as the only way that I can impact my environment and change my situation is if I am able to communicate what I want changed which can only be done through free speech.
But in a modern world, internet is the main way in which people communicate about the world and exercise their free speech.
Because snail mail is dying off, newspapers have a small population that actually reads them and are also thus dying off, so the only way in or in which you can get your opinion out to a large group of people relatively quickly is through the internet.
So if you're not allowing people access to the internet, you're essentially duct taping the mouths of thousands because you're eliminating the ways that they can communicate.
Recognize that it becomes a lot easier to regulate someone when they don't have internet access because you have a smaller reachable audience.
So once you take people offline, it is much easier to do things like regulate them further.
Preventing them from speaking in public, through through because they can't actually disclose their situation to a larger population that can show that they care about them.
So this is often how we see dictatorships deal with political dissidents.
They isolate them from the rest of the world and then no one no one is able to care about where they are or know their whereabouts and they can't communicate that they are in trouble, the government gets rid of them or imprisons them or any other number of things.
So we think that it is fundamental to a democracy to protect freedom of speech which can only be done through protecting the internet.
But our secondary of clash has to do with why freedom of information is also necessary to a democracy.
Recognize that the equivalent of modern internet a hundred fifty years ago would have been things like newspapers.
And we think that you wouldn't be able to ban that because who cares if you can say words if no one can hear them?
It's not just about freedom of speech being protected, it's also about protecting the avenues in which people hear other people speech.
Otherwise it would be okay to lock up political dissidents in a room because as long as they can yell at the walls that would be considered free speech.
But because it is not considered free speech, it shows a recognition on the part of governmental bodies and on the part of other individuals that your words only matter and are only considered protected if the government is not regulating who can hear them.
So we think that it is important in order to facilitate free speech that people also have freedom of information through the internet.
More than this though, we think that the information to make informed political decisions can only be fully found when you're using something that has that compiles the informations of thousands of thousands of sources.
Because in the end, television networks are always going to be biased.
Fox news is always going to tell me that I should vote republican, and the alternatives can be found that will always tell me to vote democrat.
But the only way that you can make your own opinion is by being able to compile all of these different opinions and decide which one you believe the most.
This kind of research in the modern day can only be done through the use of something like the internet.
For a democracy to function fully you need people to be able to make these kind of free and educated decisions and if you regulate their ability to access the internet, you no longer have this you no longer have a world in which they can do so.
We also think that the freedom of information through the internet allows very like societal benefit besides that though.
So like situations in which people grow in very conservative areas but they need to know about things like birth control in order to keep themselves from getting pregnant.
We think the internet provides people with fundamental information that lets them better their lives individually and if we believe in the pursuit of happiness, we believe in letting them have access to that.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should abolish term limits.
Term limits are an ageist policy which largely give us ineffective politicians.
We think that term limits were put in place to prevent abusive politicians from continuing their power ad nauseam.
However, were a despotic government to come to power, it is unclear why they would not abolish term limits in the first place.
As such, the continuation of term limits does little more than prevent effective politicians from continuing an effective place of power.
I will discuss why that there is no meaningful harm to removing term limits later in my speech but for now, a brief model: we would say that in the united states, term limits should be outright removed, that no term limits should be enforced on any particular position, but we would guarantee that each of those positions must be voted into office.
That is to say, if a previous position allowed you to be appointed once or twice, we would require that individuals be voted into office once the previous term limit amount was passed.
Three arguments for why this is a good idea: first off, on experience.
Individuals become more effective at a job the longer that they work at it.
Individuals who've worked for twenty years are considerably faster than people who are brand new, and even much faster than people who have worked there for just ten years.
The same is true with politics.
Understanding the the machinations of politics, understanding where to put your weight and where to spend your resources, is an incredibly important tool which allows individuals to be considerably more effective.
Whenever we force someone out due to term limits, we two things happen: first, we see that new politicians must be put into office and they must essentially walk on egg shells for their first term because they could very well be removed, because they are seen as inexperienced.
But secondly, we push someone with experience out of their position, then require them to run for a new position.
Individuals rise to the level of their incompetence under this system.
Even if they're incredibly comfortable in a position with term limits, they will inevitably have to run for larger and larger positions as they're pushed out of positions due to term limits overall.
As such, we think that this creates more competition for jobs that do not require competition and pushes effective people out of roles that they should continue to be in.
My second argument is about meaningful choice.
We think that the individuals who are voting have the best understanding of what is good and who to continue voting into power.
This brings me back to the idea of despotic governments.
The reason that we can remove term limits in the united states is if a truly despotic power comes to power, continues to pass policies that are problematic, they will remove term limits as the first thing they do.
This means that if we do not have term limits, excuse me, if we do have term limits, individuals will continue to be pushed out of office because of this ineffective policy until a despotic government comes to power, and then they'll rule forever.
As such, we don't think there's a meaningful harm to removing term limits as if a despotic government came to power in the first place, they would already remove it.
As such, abolishing term limits simply increases the total amount of choice that individuals have by allowing them to better understand politicians, to better vote for the politicians that have continued to respect their choices in the long term.
This brings me to my third argument regarding connections.
We think that politics is largely a game of who you know.
It is about meeting people.
It's about trusting individuals effectively.
When you do not have trust, politics is incredibly difficult.
If you do not trust another senator to vote with your policy after they give you their word, you are far more likely to hedge your bets, essentially water down policy, effectively ruining a lot of different effective political outcomes.
Furthermore, if you know that you're about to lose a particular seat due to a term limit, you are far more likely to lie or violate individuals' trust.
As such, we think that politics becomes far more bureaucratic and far less effective due to individuals who cannot trust each other, because they do not have a long-term incentive to maintain their truthfulness.
As such, we should abolish term limits."
"We should subsidize student loans.
Student loans are a necessary evil.
Even though the object itself is one of incredible disdain, if it didn't exist individuals in poverty could not access college.
However, the average amount that someone pays for a loan is largely not representative of that loan's effect on society.
That is to say, whenever someone takes out a loan and cannot pay it, they aren't getting much benefit from it and the corporation isn't getting any more benefit than they would from a loan that is paid back.
To this end we would propose and support the following model: that governments should use incredible amounts of money to subsidize loans to the tune of say sixty to eighty percent.
They could further use that that money to transfer all loans to subsidize loans that is to say loans that you only need to pay after you graduate college.
It will be sort of a pay it forward program where all the loans that someone pays off will then be used to help subsidize other people's loans.
Three arguments for why this is a good idea, first on when we subsidize.
We think that we subsidize if the price doesn't match the societal good.
We think when someone buys an ice cream cone, the person who sells it loses the benefits of that ice cream cone but gaining the money.
The person who buys the ice cream cone gains the benefit of the ice cream but lose their money.
This is as such essentially an equal trade between the two parties.
However if I consume fossil fuels, I pay for the fossil fuel, the company loses the fossil fuel but then the whole of society is hurt by the burned energy by the release of greenhouse gases and the general degradation of our environment.
We think that's student loans are a good, that's to say that we should subsidize them to increase the total amount of consumption beyond what individuals get for individual benefit.
Why is this the case?
First, we think that people can't think in terms of the long term.
As such they are unlikely to understand the overall benefits of an education and student loans and are less likely to consume as a result.
Second, because individuals simply have no concrete value that they can put upon education, people are bad at thinking in the abstract and as such they are unlikely to understand the total ramifications of their education.
Why is this so important?
We think that we will prove that education is a general good later and should be subsidized on that alone but it is inherently undervalued because of these other things.
Furthermore we think that corporations are happiest when student loans are paid off as fast as possible.
Why is this the case?
If I have to pay five percent interest on my loan every single year the company makes the same amount of money if I pay it off in two years and then they can loan that out to someone else who continues paying five percent per year as they would if I just paid the five percent every single year.
As such we think the older a loan is the less profitable it is to the individual but it gets no more additional profit for the corporation and as such they should be paid off as soon as possible.
My second argument is about the societal good.
We think that education is a societal good.
It allows people to challenge entrenched pedagogy and orthodoxy which allows for the creation of new ideas, new spaces, and new innovation.
Furthermore we think that more education means higher levels of skilled work, more efficient work, and generally just a happy populace in general.
Third and finally we think this will empower the poor.
We think that the poor are generally barred from an effective education in the status quo.
They cannot access it as it is simply too expensive expensive.
If we massively subsidized student loans, we are far more likely to see an increase in the total amount of people in poverty going to college.
This is incredibly important for a few reasons.
First off these people are largely not to blame for their own poverty.
If someone is taking the effort to go to college and still use a decent sum a sum of their money to get an education, they are likely not the cause of their own poverty and as such we should reward them for working harder and reducing their total suffering.
Additionally we think that we'll just generally get higher skilled workers which improves our total economy.
For this reason, we should subsidize student loans."
"The motion for today's debate is that childlessness is advantageous.
Two main areas of argumentation: the first on personal advantage and why every woman is individually better off when she chooses not to have children.
First, we want to talk about career opportunities, because we think that being pregnant for nine months and then giving birth and taking leave is uniquely a female problem.
We tell you that, oftentimes, during the course of pregnancy, women have to take reduced hours insofar as it is literally unhealthy and dangerous for them to be on their feet for the same amount of time as they usually would.
The problem with this is that every hour not working, that other people are, is an hour where you're not impressing the boss as much as these other people, where people can pretend that they're picking up slack for you, even though you're literally cannot control the fact that you cannot work right now.
But the issue doesn't just end with being pregnant, the problem extends with what happens after.
Because recognize that directly after having a child, there are two scenarios: either your work has maternity leave, in which case we still tell you this is not the best thing for you insofar as this is still time in which you're not taking care of your job and in which other people can get ahead of you in the workplace, in which case, your job your boss doesn't think of you when considering who they give the next promotion to.
But also, recognize the alternative scenario.
Because many jobs don't have maternity leave and in these situations, women are literally forced to choose between being able to keep a job and their career and put food on their table or taking care of the child they just had.
We tell you that women are uniquely pressured into choosing the latter insofar as in two-parent households, the man sees it as the woman's responsibility, as well as society, as a whole, sees it as the woman's responsibility to take care of their child first.
The problem with this is that entire careers end when women have to leave the workforce with no guarantee of rehiring and have to start from the bottom when they come back.
Next, we want to talk about economics.
Because we tell you that sure, a lot of parents don't mind spending money on their children, but that money is personally better invested when it is spent on you.
Therefore, we tell you that it is preferable, instead of buying diapers and paying for your child's education, to put that money into your retirement fund or into buying basic pleasures that make you happy and are personally self self-actualizing.
Finally, we wanna talk about personal relationships under this, because recognize that time put into building relationships with your children is time not building relationships with others.
The problem with this is that I'm never going to be able to talk to my child about what my husband did that night or how things at work are going, but, unfortunately, the people who I can talk to about this are people who I no longer maintain relationships with because after being up until five AM for an entire week straight, I just don't have the energy to go out with my friends the next day.
Don't let these relationships go foul, don't have children and actually be able to maintain them.
Our second main area of argumentation has to do with feminism and obtaining equality for women.
Because we tell you that patriarchal institutions are, in part, maintained because men aren't seen as having a weakness point that is childbirth.
Bosses don't see them as a liability because maybe they'll have to leave work when their kid gets sick and they have to pick them up from school.
We tell you that the only way to break down these kind of institutional barriers is by being able to be there at all times, not giving your boss an excuse to call you unreliable, and the only way to be able and that is the only way in which women actually get into the higher echelon and are able to hire more women and propagate good feminist thought.
But finally, let's talk about why maintaining mass female independence is good and why children hamper that.
Because recognize that in most situations, society and their husbands put the responsibility on women to take care of children first.
We tell you that this leads to two things.
First, it's just easier for men to leave when they no longer want to have kids.
They're seen as the hampered-down, nagged dad who deserves some time for themselves, and women are the ones who end up tied down to their children and not able to take advantage of other opportunities.
But also, we tell you that it's just easier for men to leave entirely, leaving women completely tied to their children, both economically and in terms of career opportunities.
You'll just never be able to access the same benefits as other men, never being able to break down the system.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should institute or introduce vouchers for schools.
So in terms the modeling we're just going to do this at the primary and secondary levels.
We're obviously not talking about colleges here but this is something that we would essentially issue a voucher for individuals that want to leave the public school system and instead go to you know a charter school or a private school, a religious school, cover some home schooling costs basically anything outside of that system.
We're obviously not going to let you know everybody leave the public school system.
We would allow people to apply for vouchers and then do it based on a lottery so that we can keep this system in control.
So two independent points.
The first is that a voucher system maximizes school choice.
I think there is a proactive right to choose what type of education your child receives.
You know we would say that there's obviously religious justifications for this that there are very profound you know orthodox jewish students for example have a religious justification for a certain type of education and we think it is an infringement on the religious liberty to restrict them from that type of education.
But secondly we would say that just preferences in general are also a perfectly fine justification.
That you know people at the end of the day have you know particular preferences and they have the freedom to act on those preferences if they believe that their child would just you know do better at a montessori school or what have you that it is there you know within their rights to send their children to a montessori school.
I think the problem though right now is that those types of schools are often cost restrictive for people that want to send their children there so voucher program is useful in that it allows people to you know go to the type of schools they would want to.
I think a lot of the costliness of this is subsumed by the fact that you know longer have to pay for them being in the public school system, so on a per student basis your public school spending goes down, you can reroute that into the voucher.
We're willing to bite that the voucher might be a little more expensive than you know whatever they would incur as a public school student because of scaling.
That said we're fine with that because the trade off is that we're maximizing school choice in allowing these parents to put their their children in the you know schooling paths that they believe are most appropriate for them.
Our second independent point is that it increases educational opportunity for poorer students.
So I think often when you look at the public school system in this country you see a system that is plagued by inadequacy particularly it like deep into inner cities there just are are poorly run schools that are deeply underfunded for political reasons that often feel quite intractable that despite the best efforts of people over taught decades and decades of work there has just been very little progress in advancing the status it and the effectiveness of these public schools.
Given that, there is often a cycle of poverty created by poor schooling that you know if I am a poor parent and then I have my children and they then have to go to public school because I can't afford them to send them anywhere better, then they wind up staying poor because their poor education means that they have trouble you know finding gainful employment after graduation and this creates a cycle that's very very difficult to escape.
I think vouchers then give an opportunity to escape that vicious cycle, that you can transfer allow students to you know go into the private schools that are significantly better because they don't have you know the restrictions that are created by public bureaucracy or by funding issues and you break down that cost barrier that you know previously held in poor families from actually receiving a quality education.
We obviously can only do this on the margins.
We can't do it for everybody but I still think progress on the margins is significantly preferable to the status quo where children have a lot of trouble breaking out of these cycles of poverty.
Proud to propose."
"We should abolish foster care.
So, we know we have to give an alternative, and that's what we're going to start by doing.
We think that the alternative to foster care is threefold: firstly, more orphanages for children below a certain age.
We think that there's a certain age at which children are unlikely to be adopted, and at that point we would be willing to open what we would consider to be similar to boarding schools, in which children are given a solid foundation.
They're raised by teachers and by peers, they grow up in an environment where they know their peers, they're not going to be moved around a lot, and they're able to get a good education similar to how children are able to live without their parents in a boarding school.
And finally, we would think that more kinship care would be the case.
So children more often going to live with family in a more stable environment.
Okay, two reasons why foster care needs to be abolished.
The first is that it's often abusive and the second is that we think these alternatives solve better for the children's needs, and the children's needs are most important in this debate.
So how's foster care often abusive?
Foster homes oftentimes are run by individuals who take in many children at one time.
This is often for the financial benefits that come and are associated with being a foster parent and doing foster care.
So what happens is people take in like a dozen children at one time let's say, and they're able to collect the tax benefits in the benefits that are come with fostering those children, and spend a fraction of the money on raising the children, and are able to use that money to do what they want to do in their life.
To have in their pocket.
To finance their own well being.
We also think that when this happens and when people are put into these homes, they're put into spaces that are cramped.
There's little personal care, there's little personal space and there's little emotional help, because of two things: first, these children often move from home to home at sporadic periods of time, which means they have no foundation.
They have no support structure in their life and no adult in their life that is a cornerstone of their life.
Someone that they can look to for advice and for guidance.
Because they are moved from one place to the other constantly.
At least when you have an orphanage or a boarding school you have some sort of stability.
You're staying in one place for a long period of time and even if you don't have parents there are adults who are around you that can be a guiding force in your life unlike in foster care.
And secondarily you're not in the same kind of the same kind of cramped environment, the same kind of environment in which other children are moving around all around you and the environment in which you don't have people who are actually trained to take care of you as you could have in boarding schools or orphanages.
Okay so why do these alternatives solve better for children's needs?
When children are in foster care and when children are of young age where they could be adopted, they are often in a stage in which any time that you rip them away from one home to put them into a next, they gain a sense of abandonment.
They gain the sense that people don't that people don't care for them, that their life is less meaningful than the lives of other people around them.
And those types of issues stick with the child for their entire life.
Even if a child isn't adopted and they spend their whole life in this boarding school until they can go on and be independent adult, at least at that point they've had structure in their life.
They've had a foundation, an education that they can use for the rest of their life, and they'll have had mentors along the way.
Mentors in this boarding school.
Adults who cared for them, who showed empathy for them and didn't just leave when that child no longer served to benefit them in some way.
Finally, we think that providing sturdy education can allow those children to be successful in the future.
That when they become adults they have a better foundation than when they come out of foster care, moving from one schooling environment the next, not being able to complete their coursework, not being able to get an understanding of what's going on in the school environment.
All these things are things that are robbed from children when they bounce from one foster home to the next which is unfortunately what foster care looks like for the vast majority of people that are within it.
We think that the alternatives are solve far better than foster care, and for these reasons we should abolish foster care."
"We should ban abortions.
So I want to be very clear what this debate is about.
When we say ban we mean when there is no medical reason for the abortion, we wouldn't allow it to be performed.
So a medical reason might be the mother's physical or mental health.
Obviously if it's a threat to the mother then we would be okay with the abortion, or if the fetus is damaged damaged in some way such that it would be unable to lead a successful life.
So for instance, if there's some trouble in the development of the fetus such that it's going to be dead at birth, we're okay with aborting it and removing it, and terminating the pregnancy then.
And on top of that, I'd like to point out that we're still completely okay with things like plan b, all forms of birth control, and other types of contraception and efforts to educate people about sexual health.
So with that in mind, I think there are two big arguments in this debate.
The first and most important it's all obviously that abortion is fundamentally unethical.
So the first thing under this is that there's a rights comparison to be made.
Obviously there are some trade offs when we talk about abortion between the rights of the mother and the rights of the fetus.
We think that this trade off is a bodily autonomy versus life.
So if you prevent someone from having access to an abortion, you do violate their right to bodily autonomy by taking away their ability to make decisions about their own personal health.
But we're okay with doing this because principally we think that the right to life of the fetus outweighs the right to bodily autonomy of the mother.
This is true for a couple of reasons: one, we tell you that the law generally regards the right to life as the most important right.
We see that murder is the most serious crime, and that in general, companies are punished the most harmfully for policies that would damage people's lives, and individuals are held to extremely high standards when it surrounds the lives of others.
Even accidentally terminating the life of another person is still a crime, manslaughter, so we don't see why it should be different in this case when the law otherwise takes a very dim view of the sort of thing.
But on top of that, we think that the right to life is more important than the right to bodily autonomy because it's facilitative to all other rights.
If you aren't alive you can't access any of your rights, and we think that the sum total of every other right is greater than the weight of bodily autonomy.
So for these reasons we think that could be the fetus wins out in this rates comparison on top of that we tell you that all human beings are of equal moral worth.
It seems extremely difficult to say that any one person is more deserving of rights or the protection of the law than any other person.
We also tell you that there's no clear line for personhood during the process of gestation.
You can't say on day eighty two of the pregnancy suddenly the fetus becomes a person, but before that it's basically just a vegetable.
It seems clear that, you know, the zygote, the most initial cluster of cells that's basically a little ball is not a person, and it seems obvious that a fetus one moment before birth is a person, or even throughout most of the third trimester, when it can survive outside the womb after premature birth, that that is a person.
So we think that we need to be conservative here, and in order to avoid killing any people, we need to assume that the fetus is always a person because we don't know when the transition occurs for these reasons it seems clear that abortion is deeply unethical because it requires the risk of killing a human being, because we can't say for certain when this change happens, because it prioritizes a lesser right over a greater right, and because it denies the moral worth of a human being.
Our second argument is about state duties.
We think that governments have an equal obligation to all citizens and people residing in their country we tell you therefore that the fetus ought be no less deserving of the protections of the state then the mother.
I think that the other side might get up here and say that the state owes the mother the right to bodily autonomy or owes the mother the right to healthcare but we think that in the same way it is a strong duty to protect the fetus this is especially strong given that the government so often acts on behalf of children much more strictly than it would on behalf of adults.
We think that that should be even more the case for the fetus because it is even less able to help itself then a child that is born would be.
So for these reasons, because of the rights trade-off we told you about, and because of the obligations of the state, we should ban abortions when there is no medical necessity.
Thank you."
"We should abolish homework.
I think the model for this is that it is not the case that teachers can't assign material to work on outside of class, but what we would rather have middle schools and high schools do is keep students after school for a couple of hours that is set aside to do homework, rather than sending them home with it.
So we're still fine with like practice problems etcetera, we just don't want it going home with students.
Two main areas of clash.
First about the dangers of stress.
We think that there is a lot of medical studies right now coming out that show that stress is actually incredibly pernicious.
So we're seeing that like it elevates your risk for a lot of future health conditions from everything from like cancer, to schizophrenia, to heart disease, to insomnia, and we think the problem with this is that you're forcing very young children to undergo large amounts of this which puts them more at risk.
But more than this, the it like also has pragmatic impacts like in the current situation.
So like we see that people with higher measured stress levels are often more prone to mental illnesses such as anxiety or issues with self-esteem, you have more physical symptoms of fatigue.
Like we really think that this is something that can be really dangerous for people, and the danger is kind of amplified by the fact that it is completely unnecessary.
Like recognize that the increase in homework load is wildly a recent development, through the late nineteen nineties children received really small workloads to take home after work.
This is why we often get the stories about how parents can't help their kids with homework anymore, because schools are just moving at a much higher pace.
And while we think that it's probably fine for schools to be more advanced, we think that insofar as entire generations were able to go without copious amounts of homeworks assigned, had no issues with their transition to university life, and like came out fairly healthy, we don't understand why this is something that is necessary in the status quo either, especially since it is seen that children actually don't learn more from homework either, and it doesn't actually improve performance on tests.
Like practice does, but the practice of giving homework does not.
So we think that insofar as this is like a very large problem that has recently developed in terms of chronic stress for middle and high school students specifically, we think this is something that we should work to alleviate, that the government should work to alleviate, and that school should try and prevent.
Our second area of clash is about allowing children to be children.
Because we think that an argument that op is going to bring up is going to be about how well children aren't going to be prepared for the real world.
We think this is just isn't factually accurate, right?
Like people are able to adapt to complicated situations, the question is just how much stress and how much unhappiness are we going to put them under now.
We think that burnout is actually really real thing.
IE, I worked so hard in high school and put so much effort into everything that I just don't have the energy in college to continue that process.
Insofar as the real world is going to hit children either way, we think that it is really necessary to give them space and give them time to explore the world creatively.
Like part of the reason america has such high obesity rates is because children aren't playing outside as often.
And honestly, if I'm stuck inside doing homework all day, it's much less likely that I'm going to go out and like exercise or play with my friends, because I simply don't have the time.
So we think that this provides individuals with a model by which they can create a healthier work-life balance, and a healthier like life exercise kind of balance as well.
Like the problem on their side of the house is that all you're doing is putting millions of minors under unnecessary stress, forcing them to trade off with other parts of their life, and preventing them from being able to experience childhood in the way that we traditionally think childhood innocence deserves to be experienced.
Proud to propose."
"We should prohibit international adoption.
So, we think that in the status quo, for the most part, international adoption is mostly a means by which western individuals, western potential parents, are able to use are able to take advantage of orphan children, to fulfill a white savior complex that they have, that they view the rest of the world as needing their assistance, and that their ability to adopt a child, from somewhere outside of their own country, is going to be immensely helpful to that country, and to those people.
But we think the case couldn't be farther from the truth, and for these reasons, we think there are a few cases in which international adoption is simply incredibly harmful, and because of them we should prohibit it.
The first is that the status quo promotes human trafficking, and we think that that's incredibly problematic.
In the status quo, the hero complex of western adults leads to a very high demand of international children, because people think they're doing this good, this universal good, by helping these forgotten children, but the case is that there is little tracking of orphans in the status quo.
So, especially in developing countries, in which the orphan system, the system of tracking these children, of taking care of these children, that don't have parents, is scant, if at all existed.
And given that this is the case, it's easy for people to take advantage of children, that aren't homeless, that aren't orphans, that do already have families.
These children are often kidnapping, and taken from their homes, sometimes they're in areas in which violence is happening, and so their parents could be killed or injured in trying to kidnap these children.
There's a there's a wide variety of ways in which human trafficking intersects with international adoption, and because it increases demand for these children, it makes it more likely that these practices will occur.
We think that when you adopt these children, you only increase the trauma that they've already gone through of losing their parent, even if they aren't a victim of human trafficking, they've still lost their parent, they've still lost their connection to their culture, and now you're going to strip them from that even further, by taking them from their cultural home, and forcing them into a western state, in which you're likely going to make them embrace a western education system, a western social social structure, a western way of living, all of these things that are incredibly different from what the child is gone through.
And we think, you're only going to put them in a place, in which they have to relive the trauma of their cultural experience, of relive the trauma on a day to day basis, of being taken from that culture.
The second problem with international adoption is that, in the status quo, a huge portion of orphans are left, are left for themselves.
Western countries don't lack orphans.
We think they're a burden on the state, and that they're often forced to bad foster care systems, because of that.
Especially older children are very unlikely to be adopted after a certain age, which means that there are a huge amount of children, even if they're older, that are in western countries, that are at the homes of these people, that are in their neighborhoods, and aren't being taken care of.
They're being forced into foster homes, in which they bounce around from place to place, they can never put roots down, in the best case scenario, and in the worst case scenario, these homes can be abusive in a wide variety of ways.
And because of this, we think that there is a neglect, a trade off, when you allow international adoption, when you allow people to adopt from outside of their country.
It means that children, that aren't as desirable, that have been bouncing around for a long time, that are a little older, are much less likely to be adopted in the in a domestic state.
And what this means is that these children, which are part of your state, which you've an obligation to protect, have little opportunity of being adopted.
That creates a competition, that involves human trafficking in other countries, and leads to people being neglected, and not having a foundation, not having the family structure, that sets you up for support and success in the future.
Because international adoption leads to abuses, both of the children that are abandoned, and of the children that experience human trafficking, in the places in which western people want to adopt these children from, and it reinforces a horrible cycle of harm, both for both for domestic and international children, we think that it's clear, that we should prohibit international adoption."
"The one child policy brought more good than harm.
So, just so everyone's clear what this debate is about, the people's republic of china had a policy throughout the nineteen eighties, nineties, and two-thousands, which limited families to one child per couple.
So basically, there was a large fee if you were found to have a second child.
, a fee that was so high that most families probably couldn't even afford it.
So with that in mind, obviously there are gonna be harms on both sides of this debate, but we're going to tell you that the good that the one child policy did outweighs the harms.
Our first argument is about how this created stability in china.
So, recognize that the one child policy reduced the food strain on the country.
China is a country with a booming population, in the twentieth century had difficulty providing enough food in order to be self sufficient.
China was unable to rely on international supplies of food because one, their population was so great that other countries couldn't supply them, and two, they had strained diplomatic relationships with the US and the soviet union that prevented food imports.
So we see that the one child policy let the population grow more slowly relative to the rate of technology improving, which ultimately allowed the country to achieve total food security which has prevented any famine or hunger in the country for the last thirty years.
Our second argument is that it led to less unemployment.
We see that china now has a very low rate of unemployment and that this is been true for several years.
The reason why this is the case is that the population has grown relatively slowly.
What that means is that as the economy has grown, new jobs are created and we've allowed the job creation to catch up with the population.
If people had continued to have many many children than the population would have grown exponentially, and ultimately the economy would have been unable to keep up.
And our third point is that it created stability by leading to fewer youths to adults.
If you look at the problems china had in the mid twentieth century during periods like the so called great leap forward, one of them was that you had many urban youths who were very radicalized relative to the older population, and who outnumber that older population.
We see that china has had relative stability because when parents have fewer children they're better able to look out for their children and prevent them from becoming radicalized, and also that when you have fewer young people it's more difficult for radical youth movements to take off.
All this has made china a more stable country which has ultimately improved the quality of life for all of the people who live there.
Before our second argument, we wanna look at some more explicit ways that this has affected quality of life.
First, in terms of accumulated wealth.
When you have lots of children you are investing your income into those children and betting that that will pay off as an investment.
You're gambling that your children will take care of you when you're old effectively.
But when people don't have children, they still have that same income and they still need to provide for their old age.
This means that they invest.
That might be in property, it might be in the markets or in business, but ultimately we see that the chinese people have been able to accumulate more personal wealth because of the one child policy, because they were putting their money into other vehicles besides children.
This means that the average chinese person is able to retire more comfortably, and ultimately that there's more money in the economy moving around to have how growth and development in the form of investment.
Our second argument is that the one child policy was good for development.
Because when the state was able to spend more money on things like roads and infrastructure instead of on childcare programs because parents were more able to provide for their families, we see that the country was able to advance very rapidly.
You saw china to go from a very poor rural country to a middle income very urban country.
I don't know if you've ever seen a photo of shanghai in nineteen ninety versus today, but the difference is shocking in how much larger the city is.
And all of this rapid growth has been made possible because of people saving money to invest, and because the state doesn't have to worry about carrying as much for families because with only one child even the poorest farmers can look out for themselves.
So for these two reasons, because of the stability that the one child policy created, and because of the increased quality of life, we think that the policy did more good than harm.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish temporary employment.
What we mean by temporary employment is when companies hire people specifically as temps, AKA they are people who are just there to fill in for a short period of time while that company is looking for someone else.
They usually have incredibly short and vague contracts that basically allow them to be dismissed at any moment, and it's something that is like known by both parties that it's going to be presumably temporary.
We think that this is specifically to to temp employees, and we think that it's like very bad for them for a few reasons.
Two main areas of clash: first, on why it's bad for the individual.
Recognize that it puts individuals in situations where they cannot predict their lives or their economic future.
They could get fired at any time for any reason, and so there's no reasonable way by which they can say, "" well, I have to behave well, "" or "" I have an incentive to behave well, "" or "" this is how long in the future I can plan.
Maybe I'll be able to book that vacation but probably not, because I have no clue if I'll still have a job. ""
And we also think that in a lot of situations, corporations tend to lie to their temps by saying things like, "" well, there's a lot of upward mobility and maybe if we like you enough, we'll keep you for the long term, "" when in reality these things are really unlikely to happen.
So a lot of the time we think people end up stuck in these jobs that will not guarantee them a long-term stay, but also do not allow them to go and put their time and effort into something else, and because people are afraid of having no jobs at all, they settle for these subpar conditions.
We also just think it's really important to note that temps in a lot of ways are institutionalized scabs in that they are often used to undercut the wages of people who might be full-time employees and force them to settle for a lower wage.
Given that companies can just keep switching out temps until they get until they find someone who will take a lower wage, there's never an incentive for a company to be competitive with regards to offering someone more money for the fact that they're going to be spending their life working at their at that company.
Like there's just never a world in which they lack the labor.
We also think that it precludes people from finding more long-term jobs.
Like, because they're hanging out with this company, a lot of the time they're hanging on this promise that maybe they'll get a job with them in the long term.
It makes it really it's really unlikely that they're able to put in the time and energy to find something permanent.
So a lot of the time people just get stuck bouncing between temp agency to temp agency and company to company, because they don't actually get to settle down and look for something that is more long term.
Our second area of clash is how it's bad for companies.
First, temps are incredibly inefficient.
Because you have to switch them out so often, you have to retrain retrain someone new every single time.
It also means these individuals tend not to be protecting the long-term reputation of the company given that their wage isn't something that is subject to go up because there's no upward mobility in this job, and because they know they're going to have to leave soon, they care a lot less about getting good work done.
They're much more likely to slack, and they're much less likely to show up as often.
We also think that every time that a temp leaves there's a switch that occurs, and there's this transitional period in which other employees have to pick up the slack for this individual.
We think they do worse jobs, first, because they are not trained for them, but also because now they are spread too thin, also because they're not actually being paid for it, and so they're willing to care less about it.
So we actually think that you just end up with terribly inefficient systems that have slightly rotating constant holes in their infrastructure.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should introduce compulsory voting.
So just quickly we're gonna lay out a model we think that it would be somewhat simple.
There would be a fine for individuals who don't vote, and obviously you have a tracking of people's birth records, their social security numbers so he would be automatically enrolled to vote and if they didn't show up at the polls, then they would be fined.
And that obviously if someone to write in a vote for literally a nonsense candidate or for a vote of no confidence, we would allow that to happen.
The whole point though is that people make it to the voting booth and express their preference, even if their preferences is for none of the above.
Alright, so three main arguments.
The first is about state legitimacy.
So in order for the state to be legitimate, it needs to have consent from the people and because there's no existing social contract, there's no literal way in which people can consent, we think that the most appropriate proxy for consent is that individuals vote.
But the problem in the status quo is that a large amount of people simply do not go out to vote, they do not have any sort of say in the government's decisions, in their decision making mechanisms, and we think that a system in which you have compulsory voting is more likely to ensure that the government aligns with the preferences of the people, and we think that this has a particular impact on a couple groups of people.
Firstly on younger individuals, and secondly on people that are in lower economic classes because these are the two groups in the status quo that have the lower the lowest percentage of voter turnout per registered voters and per populace, so we think that in having a system of compulsory voting is much more likely to drive these people to the polls which means the government becomes more representative of their views.
And there's reasons in the status quo for why these people can't vote aside from the fact that they simply don't want to, whether it's the fact that young people may not be physically close to their voting location, it's very difficult to vote absentee in certain places, or because people don't understand how absentee voting works and they're lazy or if you're a poorer individual, you may have to work multiple jobs including on the day of an election which can mean that your employer literally will not let you go to work or or in a less extreme case you simply don't have the time to go to work, so we think that part of this would be allowing these individuals to go and vote.
We think it could be a voting holiday that goes along with having compulsory voting, which means that these people would have the time and have the ability to go to vote.
Also, if you create a compulsory voting system, you have to also create the infrastructure that makes it capable for people to go to vote so that voting booths and that voting locations are not incredibly far apart from people and that you have more of these voting locations.
We think all these things make it much more likely that the government is actually representative of the people, which means that it is intrinsically more legitimate than the government that exists in the status quo.
The second thing that we think is a benefit of compulsory voting is that we think you get a more informed populace.
In the status quo because individuals know that they don't have to vote, many of them choose not to be informed about political matters.
But we think that by forcing them to vote and by saying that you must have a say, people are much more likely to just simply tune in to find out things about candidates and it's not difficult in this day and age to google candidates and find things out about their platform and to make decisions about local elections even things that things that are very niche to an area.
We think that having compulsory voting works at all levels of government, makes all levels of government far more legitimate, and makes it more likely that you'll have informed, civic engagement which we think is the sign of a healthy state.
For all these reasons we should introduce compulsory voting."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should end mandatory retirement.
Two main reasons.
The first, that we think this is age based discrimination, and thus ought be ended for protective reasons.
We think that in the end, if you're a bad worker, the corporation is able to kick you out, because you are unproductive, or a nuisance in the office, or any number of other claims that they can make against you.
But there is nothing inherent about your age that means that you shouldn't be doing a job.
The comparative is this.
We think that if a seventy year old person is being just as productive as a twenty year old in the same position, the seventy year old one shouldn't be kicked out just because they are too old, as dictated by by the corporation or the state.
More than this though, we think this is comparative oftentimes to other kinds of characteristics that people get discriminated against.
We think that in the same way that people cannot control their aging, people also cannot control their gender, and if we're protecting for things like race and gender discrimination in the workplace, you should also be protecting for things like age based discrimination.
But on a deeper level, we think this is personally important as well.
We think that in the end, you as an individual know better than any corporation what you are capable of and what is best for you.
If they are doing this for reasons of you being too old, we think this is unjust paternalization, because they are making assumptions about your capabilities based purely on your age without considering other factors.
We think in the same way that pregnant women are different from each other in regards to the productivity that they can do, or how hard like how hard they can work, in the same way that pregnancy affects every single person differently, age does too.
Just because one seventy year old is, quote unquote, too old to work, actually cannot work anymore because of age related side effects, other seventy year olds are not the same.
We think that you can evaluate when you need to step down yourself, but you can also evaluate your current monetary need better than anyone else can.
We think it's incredibly problematic when corporations can dismiss people for being too old in times when those people are likely to need money most.
We think that retirement plans oftentimes don't compensate people very well, and if you are dismissed from a fairly high paying job, you're always going to be seeing a decrease in standard of living as well.
This is problematic, because a lot of the time people have their expenditures planned out, but also as you get older you often get sicker or have other expenditures that you also have to take care of, that younger people don't.
Things like more often do you have to go to the hospital and get checkups, especially if you're a woman, things like breast cancer checkups, for men, things like prostate cancer checkups, all of these things don't start until you are much older.
Second area of clash has to do with why we don't think this is going to be very bad for the like we don't think that the other side's reasons are like particularly justified, and more so, we think there are often upsides pragmatically to why this is good.
We think that a lot of what the other side is going to say is oh no, but young people need to get these jobs and old people are keeping them up.
Two responses.
First, we think there is no reason why young people deserve that job more than you, if you have a high level of productivity and they are unlikely to outwork you.
More than this though, we think that oftentimes these are in these are these are in situations where these young people are going to be able to find a different job but you are going to be stuck in retirement.
What this means is that we ought value older people in these situations more than youth.
More than this though, we think that in a world, especially certain states such as the united states, where the amount of old people are growing much much faster than the amount of young people replacing them, we think decreasing the number of dependents is incredibly important both for individual youth and also for the system at large.
We think that a lot of the time the social security system just isn't strong enough to bear the weight of people who are getting older fairly quickly, and thus rely and thus relying on the system, not for reasons of their own incapability, but rather for reasons of why the corporation wants them out based on their age.
Decreasing dependence is good because it means that there are less strains on the social security system, which means that in the future there will be more money there for those who will get older later.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should adopt socialism.
So, because there's many different types of socialism, what we're talking about in this debate is what marx might call "" the dictatorship of the proletariat "", namely, a government in which working people control society and in which all the productive property, factories, farms, things like that are controlled democratically by working people.
So, if you work in a factory, you have control over how that factory is run, things like that.
So, three reasons why we think that we should adopt socialism.
First, we think that socialism allows us to implement a more democratic society.
Right now, although many people around the world live in countries like britain or the US, which are nominally democratic, in practice the very wealthy have much more powerful than the less wealthy.
It's very easy if you own property, for instance, to influence lawmakers to make your property more valuable or to prevent other people from benefiting from that property.
We think that this makes a mockery of democracy, when some people basically have much more influence than other people.
The only way that I can see to prevent this from occurring is to give everyone an equal stake in society.
In order to do that, you need common ownership of sources of wealth because otherwise, some people will always have a greater stake in society and more influence.
So we think we need to adopt socialism so that everyone has an equal democratic say in decision-making processes.
This would obviously impact people who are poor right now, but it would also be to the benefit of people like african americans or women globally, who have systematically been denied access to this kind of property in the past.
Our second argument is that we think we could shift production from being profit-driven to need-driven.
So, consider this: right now, corporations have to produce things in order to make a profit.
So if you're a pharmaceutical company, there is a lot more money in producing an erectile dysfunction drug, like cialis or viagra, than there is in producing a cure for some rare disease.
Ultimately, this means that you get a market that's full of erectile dysfunction drugs and very few cures for these rare diseases.
We think that in a socialist world, it's very likely that people would say, "" well we already have drugs for erectile dysfunction.
We can now turn our labs and scientists towards producing cures for diseases that right now don't have treatments. ""
In other words, the shift is away from doing what's the most profitable to doing what is the best for society.
It's possible to actually consider the wants and needs of people regardless of their wealth, because suddenly their wealth doesn't determine how important they are to the democratic decision-making process, for all the reasons we just spoke about.
So we think that if we adopt socialism, we live in a world with more cures for rare diseases, with more goods produced that people actually need, rather than things that are more profitable.
Maybe we get fewer iphones and things like that, but if that means that we get better housing for people in places like haiti, then we think we're willing to bite that harm.
And our last argument is about reducing global poverty.
We think that, ultimately, if we adopt socialism, there's much more incentive to help others abroad.
Right now, there's pretty good social welfare if you live in a country like the US or germany or britain.
But globally, there's a tremendous amount of inequality, and we think that this is largely driven by capitalism.
What we mean by this is that in order for the US and similar countries to remain wealthy, they have to extract materials from other countries and then sell produced goods back to them.
Now, today, this might take a different form.
You might produce things in a place like china, but the profits still accumulate back to the american companies that designed them, for instance.
We think that you can change this and that in doing so, you allow more distribution of wealth globally.
In other words, the wealth that people working in china or in bangladesh create when they produce something can now be kept in those countries rather than being sent to the west.
So for this reason, we think you would reduce poverty globally in a tremendous fashion.
So for these three reasons, we should adopt socialism.
Thank you."
"Mandatory retirement brings more good than harm for two big reasons.
First because there is a problem of aimless incompetence that often correlates with a greater age and secondarily because it restricts the ability for it makes it harder for younger people to find jobs, it hurts labor markets participation for younger people.
So let's first start by talking about ableness and competence.
There's two obvious components that that any kind of job can require.
It can require you to engage in like physical labor some kind of like physical activity that requires you to do physical work or secondarily a job can require you to make use of your mental functions or cognitive functions.
Oftentimes you're required to do both.
You're at the very least always required to do one or the other.
Now this presents a problem because as you age one or both of these is very likely to deteriorate.
Obviously physical obviously older people are more prone to physical injury like bones deteriorate, you're more likely to get injured, you're more likely to get sick or other kinds of ailments but you're also more likely to experience like some kind of cognitive stains like you could just do work slower.
It may take your reaction time can slow down.
You may end up developing alzheimer's, things like that.
These are real harms that make it a lot harder for you to do your job.
Now you may be saying aha but that's fine people will be able to realize that and then they'll just retire and everything will be great.
But the problem is is that's not always the way that this works out.
Oftentimes the individual likes to put more confidence in themselves.
Individuals usually over estimate their ability to do any kind of particular task.
Further they're further more likely to do that when the conclusion is unpleasant.
People don't want to be too old to do a job that they've possibly be doing for a long time.
People don't want to feel like accept that maybe their cognitive skills aren't as sharp as they used to be.
It's a very difficult thing for people to accept.
Maybe for some people but not for others.
And I think that this is the more important group to identify by mandatory retirement because obviously some people are going to retire optionally anyway but mandatory retirement makes sure that all groups of people are going to experience in the same way.
This is further necessary because it's oftentimes illegal to retire, it's oftentimes illegal to fire people on the basis of simply age or something like that.
So because that's just like age based discrimination which you can't exactly do in terms of firing somebody.
So without this law in place it's very likely that it would be difficult to fire people for possibilities of like not being able to do their job as well.
But the second thing that I want to talk about is youth labor participation.
So the way in which job structures work especially if you tend to stay in the career in which you've been in for awhile is as you gain more experience in a given field and as people you tend to get like more promotions and it oftentimes it's like a job hierarchy or like a ladder in that what as you get more and more experience, you're more likely to get more promotions or better jobs within that sector however there's obviously limited jobs in each sector so at each level if people aren't constantly moving on, if people at the top rungs aren't retiring at one point then people the next rung aren't going to be able to move on and so on and so forth.
So this creates a problem especially nowadays where life expectancies are becoming a whole lot longer and people are trying to work a whole lot later.
You see that it becomes very difficult for a lot of younger people to find jobs and the reason for this is because is because there is much like higher rates of employment amongst like older people, amongst like younger people so when you have like older people that are working a job at a supermarket, for example, that's a job that can't go to a younger person and this is, in a lot of ways, very bad because younger people don't have access to a lot of the same social safety nets and services that older people do.
They're not able to get access to medicare or social security or a whole lot of other things.
So oftentimes younger people are more dependent on those jobs but additionally it's also just more important for younger people to get started on jobs so they can get their career going in a lot of in in that sense.
For all those reasons there should be a mandatory retirement age."
"We should abolish trade barriers.
We mean by this is that we would remove any kind of barrier to trade as like exactly as it sounds basically.
If you have very high import or export taxes, we would try to make those as low as possible.
We would remove any kind of trade sanctions, such as what was happening between cuba and the united states for a very long time.
We basically want free trade as much as possible between every country as possible.
Two main arguments, first on supporting the free market.
We think that competition on the international level oftentimes is good in an objective sense, regardless of what the outcomes are.
Because on an intuitive level, less trade barriers just mean that you are going to sell more.
More in depth on this, we think that oftentimes there's a fear that if you want to like particularly politically punish a country, or if you're worried about them outcompeting you, it's this fear that like you have to do things, like have really high import taxes in order to protect your country personally.
But we think the problem is that these kinds of behaviors often get mimicked, right?
Like we think that when one country starts to put up trade barriers because it's trying to protect their domestic product, but it continues to export mass amounts of those products, other countries get a little bit scared by this, and they oftentimes react in similar manners.
But we think that oftentimes that sale is always going to matter more than the amount of money you might make off of the import or export taxes, and is always going to be better economically than any kind of political preference for a certain country it might look politically.
We also think that if it is the case that another country can outcompete you, as is the fear by a lot of countries that protect their domestic market by having like high trade barriers, we think that that that is just a signal to your economy that there are countries out there that can do this more efficiently, which means you can switch to buying from them oftentimes for a price that is cheaper than what you are using to grow it in the first place.
It also signals to you that you can switch and move your labor to something that you're more competitive in.
We see this a lot with first world countries in the status quo, where they're switching from manufacturing to things like research and development, because they're recognizing that manufacturing is just vastly more competitive in more developing countries that have less labor laws and less restrictions on their corporations.
And we think this is a net positive move, we think that it actually works in a very symbiotic matter, where those developing countries can now have more of like economic edge in their particular field, but you as a more developed country can develop your economy even further and grow even more developed.
So we think that's always positive.
But we also think that this impacts the way that corporations make decisions.
Because we think that high trade barriers are essentially a signal of risk to the corporations that are considering investing or placing their companies within your countries.
This is why we often see manufacturing companies go to those developing countries in the first place, because they have really low trade barriers and really low regulations inside.
And we think it's actually really bad because if you're a country that uses a lot of trade barriers, which happens to be a lot of nations, that limits which which corporations are going to be willing to be within your country, which we think is very problematic for you.
But it also limits the interactions that corporations can have.
Like if I'm an american corporation and there are sanctions in cuba, that necessarily prevents me and might work as a reason that I might want to leave and do this in another area.
Our second argument is about creating cooperation.
No one wants to go to war with their trade partners because once a trade relationship is established, doing something that jeopardizes it can harm your citizens.
And we think what happens right in the status quo is that your infinitely more likely to start conflict if you aren't trading with that country, because you know that you're not going to have to be afraid of like the trade stopping and like the suffering that your economy might get from that.
We think that we want individuals to be more wary of these kinds of situations.
And what we mean by this specifically is that we think that having that extra step of "" oh, I know I'm trading with this person, maybe I'll go start a compromise or start some kind of like send an ambassador there and we'll talk about it instead "", is a positive way of using trade to actually foster cooperation between countries.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban full body scanners.
Two main areas of clash: first on why it is rights violative.
Recognize that privacy rights are something that have been given to us first by the constitution of the government but also just based on the way that society appreciates itself and every individual within it.
Let's talk about the constitution first.
Recognize that the constitution, like any other like binding piece of paper, represents a contract between the individuals and the government.
And when the government fails to uphold this contract it violates the rules of that contract and fails to fulfill a like fundamental job that it has.
Like recognize that what the constitution is is a like statement on the part of the government: "" here the rights that you have and that I am sworn to protect in exchange to be able to limit some of your rights, like your ability to be mobile.
And and some of your like some of your more broad like privacy rights.
Like the ability to monitor you in some records. ""
But at the end of the day once it stops doing so, the government stops fulfilling those like basic needs.
Right?
Like recognize that the pragmatics don't matter insofar as the good is idiosyncratic.
And the only way that we can legislate that got on the part of the government is through a document that everybody has agreed to as being the most fundamental to not, to protecting the other things that we see as good.
This is why we have things like protections of freedom of religion.
Because it is true that there is never going to be a world in which we see every individual's religion as the same.
And there's never going to be a world in which I value someone else's religion to the same extent as mine.
But what the government can do is preserve everybody's abilities to define that good through something like freedom of religion.
We also just think that predictability on the part of the government is incredibly important.
If the government says that you have this like right and then two days later takes it away without informing anybody, then it necessarily means that people cannot predict the actions of the government and cannot predict their own rights and safety.
We think this is incredibly important insofar as the way in which people trust the government is based in their prediction of the government's actions and in their predictions that the government will act in the way that are best for them.
We also think that it's important in terms of preventing over scrutiny of the government.
Recognize that bodies are very intimate and very personal, and massively part of the way that we self actualize and relate to the world insofar as our physical presentation is within our bodies, even if we might interact with each other on some deeper level.
So as the tool through which we communicate to the world bodies therefore retain some rights in terms of the way that we self actualize within them.
We think that if I am someone who is like overweight and wants to hide that, then it is important that my right to like to not be seen through a screen by personal strangers, by like random strangers, is something that ought to be preserved and something that is incredibly important.
But our second area of clash is just on why these things are entirely useless.
Recognize that there have been tons of security tests that have shown that professionals can get past these kinds of machines with no problem by changing the material that they build their weapons out of and by hiding them in the correct places.
The problem with continuing to use a piece of machinery that is so bad is that it creates a false sense of solvency.
It means that we stop innovating and finding new ways to ensure security because we think that it has already been solved.
This means we provide an opening to criminals that is incredibly consistent and readily exploited that we will never end.
Criminals know they can rely on it therefore can use at their whim.
It also means that when something does go wrong no one blames the technology because humans inherently tend to trust technology more than they trust individual error.
So rather than attributing any kind of problem to the tech, they're going to say: "" no, look, these are the people who are manning the machines at that time and this is why they are the ones who are actually to blame.
We think this is really bad first because it puts those people's jobs at risk.
If I am the TSA agent who just arbitrarily happens to be running that booth at the time at which a breach happens, I probably shouldn't lose my job it's not my fault that the breach happened.
But it also means that we're never going to change the tech, only changing the people, which means you never solve the fundamental problem.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should legalize doping in sport.
So the model is pretty intuitive here, we would allow for performance enhancing drugs.
We would presumably restrict this with reasonable regulations on like safety, side effects, that sort of thing.
So we're not going to allow people to utilize strains of anabolic steroids that'll like give them cancer.
I think we can just put like the standard regulations you would put on to like a pharmaceutical drug or something like that.
Under this, three independent points.
First, that it maximizes the entertainment value of sports, second, that the black market that exists in the status quo is harmful to athletes, and third, that athletes can meaningfully consent into this system and we respect their autonomy.
So on the first point, that it increases the entertainment value.
I think fundamentally the purpose of sport is to entertain people.
This is why people watch it, this is why it is a multi-billion dollar industry.
It's because you watch this thing and you enjoy watching this thing.
So when you have these performance enhancing drugs, people are capable of more complex feats.
It increases the entertainment value.
You really, really like watching people like dunk in basketball or hit home runs in baseball.
That happens more frequently when people are capable of more complex feats, when they are at higher physical prowess.
And you continually push the bar higher when you maximize that capacity to act in astounding ways.
I think fundamentally that's why people enjoy sports.
Because you watch these things happen that is beyond what is often imaginable as the limits of human action and of course with the drugs that is something that is going to happen frequently.
On the second point, that the black market is bad.
So we think of the status quo.
There's still a lot of use of performance enhancing drugs.
This really, we see it, has two harms.
One, it means there's inequity in the system.
That those who are willing to break the rules because they have either the financial resources to do so, or the connections and networks to sort of sweep everything under the rug, are the ones that are capable of doing it.
That leads to inherent unfairness in the system and we think that by legalizing this, it becomes an option for everybody.
But secondly, there's no supervision in the status quo.
And that means the system is rife for health risks.
When you don't have a market that really like allows you to buy these safely, like you don't know who you're buying them from these are drug dealers, they're pretty sketchy people, but also there's not a supervised situation in which you inject these things because generally people want to have plausible deniability.
You're engaging in what's pretty risky activity.
So we think that by creating a supervising structure and a regulatory system we can greatly improve the health of athletes, or at least like decrease the health risks to them.
On the third point then, consent.
So we think that physicians will inform these athletes of the risks that they're taking on by taking these drugs.
Like a, we would just require it by law, but b, there's also like a competitive incentive to do so.
So when we open up the system that allows them to internalize these risks in a meaningful way, because we can provide them with pamphlets and things like that and this will just become common knowledge in the way that you know the risks involved with other pharmaceutical drugs are generally common knowledge, we would say that people have the right to consent into that then.
That at a certain point, autonomy is something that we as a society respect.
It is a very fundamental right that people should be able to do what they choose, assuming there are no third party harms, and given that we think that this is true here.
That there are no third party harms.
That if you decide to take anabolic steroids, that's a risk you internalize on an individual level and we respect your right to make that decision.
Given that, we think the people have the ability to consent in because they understand the risks and they are making that decision for themselves.
Given that, I think it is reasonable to legalize these substances.
Proud to propose."
"We should ban gerrymandering.
I think the thing that is always going to be most important in these kinds of rounds when we're dealing with government policy and the ways in which individuals get to affect democracy, is that whichever group proves that they are more democratic and adhere to the democratic system better, wins this round.
Why?
Because recognize that when you live in countries like the united states, it doesn't matter what happens to be most efficient when it comes to political systems, and it doesn't matter what one particular political group might want.
What matters is the political opinion of the majority of individuals within that country.
And when your vote is misrepresented based on regional populations and the way that you draw those lines for districts, then you can never ever be truly representative of the individuals that you are created to and beholden to based on the constitution, to protect and reflect.
So we think that this is actually an incredibly easy gov ballot.
As long as we show you that we adhere to the democratic system that the US promises it is, we win the round on face, even if they show that it is more efficient.
Because recognize that literal even if they show that it's more efficient or that it's in the interests of one particular group.
Because recognize that literally everything can be justified as being good for someone, right?
Like we think that complete dictatorship is still good for the individuals who are in power, but we still resist those systems, because we recognize that they are not worth the trade-off.
Three main arguments, first on the inability for politicians to be effective.
When you distort individuals preferences by redrawing district lines so that you essentially obfuscate the individuals who do not agree with a certain party, you eliminate the ability for politicians to see what their substituents are actually asking from them.
So when republicans repeatedly redraw the lines in states like washington so that they can group together red minority democrats with large swathes of republicans, even though those democrats could make up a district on their own, that, sure, brings the republican party more into office, but it also prevents the democratic will of those populations from actually being heard.
And this creates an endless cycle, because politicians can just keep switching the regional lines based on where they think the demographics lie, and the gerrymandering can just allow them to continue to win.
So it just keeps people in power who in an objective sense ought no longer be so.
It also puts their self-enrichment above the will of the public, which is incredibly tyrannical because it basically says "" I want to maintain power more than I want to serve the democracy that I promised I would serve "".
Our second argument is about the way in which it decreases civic engagement.
People notice when gerrymandering occurs because the district lines change, and they see that even though they are surrounded by individuals who share their political views, their state isn't reflecting that.
And they see that it delegitimizes their vote by basically making them invisible, if they happen to be that minority political party that's grouped in with that larger amount.
This creates learned helplessness.
People grow politically apathetic because they feel like their voice won't matter anyway.
Which is incredibly problematic, because when you are apathetic and unlikely to engage with your government, that is when you can no longer actually create the country that you want to create, and we think that civic engagement is the way that these countries continue to run.
Our third argument is about the way that it is used to oppress.
You can literally divide a minority group between two regions with large populations of a different group through gerrymandering, which makes it so that those minority groups never get heard, because when votes happen their voices get outshouted, even though those lines should never have been drawn in the first place.
This is especially problematic when it takes the form of racialized lines, because like black individuals in the south oftentimes vote differently from what, say, southern republican whites.
This is really bad because this is a group that historically has been oppressed, that continues to not be able to get their voice heard.
Proud to oppose or propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish intellectual property rights.
Two areas of clash, the first on why there doesn't actually exist a rights basis for these conceptions.
First, we tell you that you can't own an idea.
Ideas are products of your circumstances, your schooling, your genetics, and your environment.
And insofar as anyone put into those same contexts would be liable to come up with them, we don't think that you can like fully ascribe these ideas as ownership to someone based on such arbitrary factors.
Like given that maybe I'm just economically not in a situation where I could have ended up at an elite university, or like maybe that semester I didn't get to sign up for that class, all of these things influence whether or not my mind comes to a certain idea.
We don't think that you should like be able to own that thing.
We also think that most patented stuff are just didn't are more discoveries than actually new material or information.
We think that as such, this should be the collective knowledge of all individuals.
Like people can still make money off of their creations.
They can still build something and then sell it mass-produced.
It's just not we just tell you that they can't keep long-term ownership over something that we don't think they ever had a right to keep in the first place.
We also just think that these kinds of rights get weighed against things like the right to life.
Like if the medication that you need in order to continue living is something that you can't get because it got patented and is now incredibly expensive, we think that it's more important these individuals get the help they need than that someone gets to claim an arbitrary right over this thing, and thus like keep making money.
Like those are just not as important as each other.
Our second area of clash is why IP rights put a damper on innovation.
First, we tell you that it discourages collaboration.
If you want the patent first, you don't work with others for fear of them stealing it, or for fear of someone else coming up with something better or using your research in bad ways.
As such, we think that a lot of the time people don't actually work with each other, when working with each other would make things a lot more efficient, and resources would be used better, and you'd actually get a lot more minds working on a problem, rather than one person getting stuck and being really slow.
We think this allows a subpar system with regards to collaboration that we'd prefer didn't exist.
But we also tell you that it allows subpar creation due to lack of competition.
Like part of what forces people to be better is the awareness that others can one up you or that your thing won't sell, and removing this fear causes apathy, because people don't actually have an incentive to be better if the general populace doesn't have another choice but to buy their item.
So, when people patent something, it makes it impossible for someone else to mess with that thing or to like build a similar product for a while after that patent is made.
What this means is that there's this two, three, four, five-year period in which people can just sit back on their haunches and not actually work on anything new or make sure that their product is even good, because they've already secured the patent so they don't have to worry about that extra competition.
And so we think the way in which you make better products and make better goods is by making people essentially afraid of losing their right to that item and stuff like that.
We also think that creating monopolies out of patented basics is really bad.
Think a lot of the time what you see is a very large corporation patenting like a certain type of screen or a certain type of keyboard, like very fundamental proportions of something that are necessary for other things to be built of that caliber.
And what happens is that a lot of the time after they've patented it, the technology that depends on that patented component can't actually go through and cannot be made.
So it stifles innovation in that people can't even begin to think of new innovative ideas while there's a fundamental portion that is patented.
I also just briefly want to touch on unused patents.
Like lots of companies will just patent mine as much as possible so that other companies can't own that thing and can't use it.
They sit on these patents, and so we actually think a lot of lifesaving technology never gets used, because you have companies that already patent it but never use it.
You also end up with patent trolls that make money and extort people into like by using like very fundamental patents.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should ban gerrymandering.
So, we think that the only real way you can ban gerrymandering is to have a two-tiered system because if you cede all control to computers, it means that you have a system that doesn't take into account communities.
It's difficult for computers to understand the different sort of facets of building an electoral system that are important: trying to keep communities together, trying to keep representation of races and and classes somewhat equal within populations.
So here's were going to do: first, we're going to build districts via computer-generated maps.
So these maps are going to be entirely built based on computers.
Then they will go through an approval process by a bipartisan board.
When we say bipartisan, we mean bipartisan.
There will be an equal number of members on this bipartisan board to ensure that you that once you have a computer-generated model, that you're that you then have a review process that isn't based on political will.
It's not based on political desire of one party or another.
If the board refuses or if it thinks the map is wrong, it needs to give a detailed reason as to why.
That information will go back to building future computer-generated maps, and we think that this should be done on a five to ten year rolling basis.
So, a few reasons for for this: first, you get more accurate representation.
And let's be clear, when we're talking about our democracy, when we're talking about the legitimacy of our democracy, what's important is not the fact that people go out and vote.
It's not the fact that we have a president and a congress that are democratically elected.
What's important is that you get an accurate representation of what people actually want when it comes to legislation.
When you have a system of gerrymandering, you lead to a you lead to a system in which many people are excluded from having an actual voice in that system, because you have packing of districts so that you have overwhelmingly conservative or liberal districts, and you have cracking of areas to ensure that areas that would be majority one party one party or the other are split into two.
You have a system in which we are in which we are distinctly and explicitly trying to select the constituents from the politicians' perspective.
And we think it's incredibly undemocratic for politicians to pick their own constituents, for a politician to say: these are the people I want to represent, moving forward.
These are the people I do not want to represent, moving forward.
I want my election to be this easy.
This is overtly undemocratic, and it's and it leads to a system in which you don't have accurate representation of what people actually want.
And the status quo leads to a clear lack of competitive districts, which leads to a few harms.
First, it entrenches bad politicians.
For example, in new jersey, robert menendez is being is has been basically found guilty of ethics scandals but is entrenched because he is an incumbent politician, because the because the area is is so deeply blue, there's not a lot of competition, and this happens at the district level as well, and we think that that is incredibly problematic.
It also allows politicians to posture rather than to legislate in their constituents' best interest, because they know they're going to get reelected.
They know that as long as they say the right words, they can profit off of their they can profit off of their off of their existence.
They can profit off their job and probably still get elected because eighty five percent of people in their district or sixty five percent, probably more accurately, are from their party.
It also creates more extreme candidates.
When you have districts that are seventy percent one party or the other, it means that you're more likely to have a large portion of those people be incredibly extreme on either end of the political spectrum, and it means that instead of having a system in which you have one moderate candidate versus another, you have an extreme candidate who's going to win and go into office, and gerrymandering is part of what we saw lead to the rise of the tea party movement in the late two thousands.
For all these reasons, we should ban gerrymandering."
"We should abandon online dating services.
So, by we should abandon, I mean to say that, as individuals, all of us should choose to stop using these services.
We think that things like online websites, where people create dating profiles, or apps that let you swipe through people in your area are the types of services that we're talking about.
So with that in mind, we have a few arguments for our side about why we should abandon these online dating services.
The first is that they encourage us to objectify people.
When you're looking through a list of people on an app on your phone, you're not really thinking of them as individuals.
Consider how it's different when you meet someone in person versus when you see someone in an app.
If you see someone in an app or on a website, you're likely to think only about their appearance, their job, and whether you think that they're good, based on those perspectives.
You don't have any human connection.
It's kind of like how you buy a television.
The same way that you might go to a website to look at the statistics about a certain TV and see whether it's specifications are good and if it'll fit on your wall, you're now looking for a girlfriend or a boyfriend the same way.
You're thinking "" oh, well that person's job isn't very good, "" or "" he's too tall, "" or "" she's too fat, "" that kind of thing, and not actually thinking about them as individuals.
On the other hand, when we meet people in person, we tend to have a more human response to them.
We see that maybe this person has a really good sense of humor, maybe they have similar values to you, maybe they grew up in the same area that you did and you have some connection relating to that, and it's unlikely that you're going to see many of these connections online.
Even if these services are really good and they help you to see some of these connections, it'll never be as holistic as the picture you get in person, so it will always encourage you to objectify people and break them down to the numbers rather than see them as an individual.
And we think that that's likely to lead to shallow and superficial relationships, because they're founded on a shallow and superficial basis.
Our second argument is that people are likely to be unsatisfied when they use online dating.
What do I mean by this?
If you're on a website where there are millions of members all looking for a relationship, it's probably really difficult to realize when you have a good thing.
Let's say you've been going out with a guy for a couple of weeks and you think you like him, but now you've matched with a couple of other people on the site and you want to give them a chance as well.
So you stop talking to this guy as much and move on to other people because he wasn't perfect.
But mister or missus perfect doesn't exist.
We think that people are likely to ignore the good in the interest of the perfect, and ultimately to be unsatisfied because of that, whereas when you meet people in person, it's less likely that you'll always be looking for the next best thing to come along, because you're not actively scrolling through lists of hundreds of people, you're just organically meeting new individuals.
So we think that it's unlikely people will be satisfied from these dating sites and ultimately that it would be harmful to your happiness to use them therefore.
And our final point is about why you shouldn't trust the companies that make these services.
If you use a program that tracks your location in order to match you with people, then presumably they're storing that information.
And remember, if these dating services are free, then you're not the customer you are the product.
The reason why they can offer these expensive services for free is because they're selling your information to advertisers or other purchasers.
So, ultimately, when you use these services, you're setting yourself up to be targeted by other companies who want to get something out of you.
We think that, in general, people should be conservative with their personal information online, trying not to give away everything about themselves, where they live, their interest, what they like, because when you do that, ultimately someone is going to sell that information, and you're going to be harassed more and more by advertisers, which we already see is a problem today.
For all these reasons, we should abandon online dating.
Thank you."
"We should limit the right of self defense because people are incredibly bad actually evaluating real danger and making good decisions that are good for preventing death and injury and this reality gets in the way of ultimate in acting your ideals of justice as a just society making sure that due process is followed and all these kinds of things.
So let's start by talking about why you need to limit the right to self defense because in the status quo in a lot of places self defense is given an incredibly wide degree of latitude.
It's very easy to claim self defense to get out of a lot of crimes especially throughout america and especially throughout the american south and I think that that's very important because people aren't very good at actually evaluating threats and there's a lot of reasons for this.
First and foremost of those is racism.
A lot of people because people grow up in a society where you're constantly being told that like muslims are terrorists, that black people present threats to you and things like that, that you're more likely to impose threats on to other people even if they don't exist and examples of this are really obvious especially in america where you see police killing unarmed black people on a regular basis and these are trained professionals, these are police officers.
Now imagine the average individual who doesn't even have police training and isn't even trained at isn't even supposed to be trained in de-escalating situations or being better able to actually identify the degree of a threat level.
So I think that most people are going to assume that the threat may be higher.
I think that secondarily oftentimes people are going to be very fearful and uniquely illogical in a situation where self defense may be necessary because if you think that there may be a danger to you or somebody else around you you're going to be very likely to act quickly without thinking especially if you have a weapon on you or something like that and I think that's very bad because it can lead to a rash decision making.
Rash decision making that could lead to you injuring somebody who didn't deserve to be injured, leading to you injuring yourself because you escalated the situation.
Maybe it was a robbery and obviously robberies are bad but a robbery is worse if the person robbing you ends up shooting you because you try to fight back or things like that.
There's all kinds of reasons why I think that like limiting the right of self defense will make it so that maybe people are going to be more likely to instead of trying to fight maybe the emphasis can be on calling for help or fleeing or a duty to de-escalate.
But additionally I think that the inexperience and lack of qualification is uniquely important because in addition to just like the racism point, you're talking about people who could come from like a wide range of backgrounds and qualification and things like that and most people don't have any kind of training in de-escalation, don't have any kind of training in actually understanding conflicts and threat levels.
So all of that is very important because it prevents the ideals of justice in a just society from being enacted and the reason for that is because in a just society you're innocent until proven guilty and if in the act of self defense or crime if maybe like there's a robbery going on the robber gets shot, obviously that person is still committing a crime but the like punishment for robbery isn't like roadside execution by a random person society.
We still have due process checks.
We still believe that guilt isn't just that you commit a crime but it's going through a series of procedures to actually establish guilt and additionally there's also the principle of proportionality where it's important to make sure that the punishment is proportional to the crime.
That's why we have things like laws and all these kinds of legal checks in the first place to make sure that the criminal defense system and the justice system are fair systems and those require that self defense and individual citizen actions are done in the most minimal form possible.
So for all of those reasons, we should absolutely limit the right of self defense."
"We should abolish open primaries in the united states.
It's important to recognize what a primary actually is and what the purpose of that primary is in the first place.
Primaries are the part of an election process where parties themselves are able to directly interact with their constituents, with the base of support that has brought the party to national prominence, that has allowed the party to flourish and win elections at local and state levels.
It's the opportunity for the party to interact with the people that volunteer, the people that donate, and the people that make the party possible in the form that it exists.
It's a time for the party to communicate with its constituents rather than lobbyists and other special interest groups.
This is why we believe that open primaries in the united states need to be abolished, because open primaries dilute the ability for the party to interact with its base.
An open primary allows any individual within the united states, any member within the state to go and vote in a primary, even if they are not a registered member of that political party, or even if they're a registered member of the opposing political party.
We think that this is problematic because firstly, the base is the most important structure that allows a party to survive.
Party candidates are able to moderate after they become after they move through in the general election, but the base needs to support that candidate in their primary and foundational beliefs if the party is going to win elections and ultimately support that base that has given to them so much in the past.
We think that it's more likely the case that when you have an open primary, results get skewed in such a way that individuals that have more moderate use, that don't actually represent what your base believes in, are going to be nominated nominated for office.
This is a problem because firstly, it means that your base is less enthusiastic about the candidate and less likely to turn out, which means that at a party level, you're just less likely to get that candidate nominated.
But secondly, it's a massive waste of an opportunity for the party to actually get an understanding of what their base wants.
When you don't allow the base to be the exclusive messenger of what the party primary is stating, of the the main determining factor, the only determining factor in who the primary ultimately yields, it means that the party understands and has misinformation about what the base is looking for.
For example, if you're a person in the democratic primary and you're running under a much more liberal much more liberal banner, but you allow for conservatives and an open primaries to take place and a more moderate candidate gets promoted, it means the democratic party isn't able to see the contention and the desire for a more progressive wing within the party.
This is problematic because it ultimately leads to people becoming disenfranchised with that party and with the political process in general, because they never see their candidates making it to the general election.
Yes, it is important for moderate candidates to make it to the general election, but over the entire history of presidential and and gubernatorial politics, people have moderated once they've gotten the nomination.
We don't think that it's a major issue for candidates, and especially in the current time when persons like when people like donald trump can be elected and theresa may can be elected in the united kingdom, it's not especially important that moderation happened for the party to survive but simply that the base is heard, that people feel like they have a say in the party that they give their money and time to.
We think that open primaries massively dilute that process.
And it's not like individuals cannot choose to become a member of that party if they feel so deeply about it.
You can still switch affiliation between political cycles if you feel so strongly about voting.
We don't think that open primaries are the only way for participation to occur, but open primaries certainly avoid the potential for parties to learn from their base, communicate with their base, and yield a candidate that their base, the people that they exist to represent, want to have.
For those reasons, we should abolish open primaries in the united states."
"We should abandon the insanity plea.
So, in this round, we're going to make two broad arguments as to why the insanity plea should not exist in the criminal justice system.
The first is that it creates an immense stigma around mental illness, and the second is that, at most, some sort of mental illness can be a mitigating factor, but it should not be something that allows you to walk free without guilt.
Okay.
So, firstly, on to the stigma.
We think that in the status quo, the the insanity plea and the idea of the insanity plea in popular culture is one that paints mental illness as something that bars an individual from having any sort of control over one's actions, that to be insane and to have a mental illness are the same thing, and that to and that if that is the case for you, you are someone that cannot control your actions and is subhuman.
This simply is not the case.
We think that there's a surly spectrum of illnesses that the insanity plea fails to recognize but that people are still able to be cognizant of their actions and make decisions for themselves, even if they are suffering from some sort of mental illness or insanity.
The second thing is that we think this creates an out for people who conduct hate crimes, such as the charleston shooter.
The charleston shooter in south carolina has pled pled not guilty by reason of insanity, and did so because they were able to use their idea of hatred, their their mental state at the time as one that passed off as insanity to the public eye, because people in the public may have viewed that as something that someone would literally need to be insane to hold.
But this isn't the instance of insanity that should matter.
This isn't something that meaningfully stopped him from processing the actions he was taking, choosing not to take the actions that he undertook, and recognizing that what he was doing was wrong, that societally and that socially, the action he was taking was wrong.
We think the insanity plea gives an excuse for people who are not insane to try and get out of their crime, especially in cases of hate crimes, especially in cases of very heinous crimes, where people have assumptions about the mental state of the accused in general.
Okay.
So, secondly, we think that mitigating circumstances just work better in these instances.
It's important to have a mitigating circumstance for instances in which people genuinely can't control their actions and instances in which someone literally lost the ability to control what their body was doing, literally lost the ability to use their mental capacities in order to decipher between right and wrong.
These are instances in which we should have a mitigating circumstance, but this is not how the insanity plea behaves.
The insanity plea says, yes, everything that happens did happen, but we cannot be tried, based on that, because we are insane, and the entire criminal trial becomes one that is based around whether or not someone meets the burden of insanity.
We do not think that this is how criminal trials should happen.
We think that once someone admits that they did something wrong, once they admit to the crime that has been committed, there may be a reason why you give them a lesser sentence because of their mental state, but they are still a guilty actor who has recognized that what they did is something that is wrong and were obviously cognizant enough about it to understand that they took that action in the first place and to plead guilty.
In these instances, we don't think the insanity plea works because it allows people to get off for crimes entirely.
It doesn't just mitigate the sentence that they receive for that crime.
We think that is wrong because it doesn't give the justice that victims seek, and it doesn't uphold the criminal justice system in the sense that it allows people of certain of certain mental illnesses and allows people of certain limited capacities to get off free and have no repercussions for their actions.
It degrades the ability for the criminal justice system to deter people in the future, and it doesn't provide the justice that victims seek.
For these reasons, we should abandon the insanity plea."
"I'm proud to support the motion that we should abolish capital punishment.
Our first independent point is that even prisoners have a right to life, and that if there is no countervailing justification for doing so, we should never enact a punishment.
So we think that the purpose of the criminal justice system is twofold: the first is to, in some capacity, rehabilitate individuals in a way that can allow them to function in society again.
This is because every human being, regardless of what they have done, has rights.
And we think that if we can get a person to a point where they can reassimilated into society, that is a good thing to do.
But secondly we think the criminal justice system's purpose is to protect the rights of the innocent.
So things like neutralization, IE putting someone in prison to ensure that they're not going to commit a crime again is an important component of the criminal justice system.
We don't think either of these purposes though are served by capital punishment.
All capital because the comparative is just like life in prison, the only comparative of capital punishment seems to be inflicting more harm on the person who has committed a crime just for the sake of doing so.
IE retribution in situations where you think the crime is so severe that you need like more retribution.
We don't think, however, that there is a moral justification for engaging in retributive justice, because we think that broadly speaking, the rights of the innocent don't extend to like needlessly inflicting harm upon the person who committed the crime.
We don't think that like an eye for an eye actually makes the world any better.
At that point then, because the like actual execution of this individual doesn't serve any sort of broader purpose we don't think it is justified.
Rather we think it is a needless infringement on the rights of the individual being executed.
Our second independent point is wrongful imprisonment.
So we think that obviously this happens.
Like you hear about like these stories at the news where it's like: "" oh, x person was like exonerated from their crime thirty years later due to DNA evidence. ""
Like this sort of thing happens with like fairly high regularity.
We think also it is clear that this frequently happens with people that are on death row, due to the extreme nature of their crimes.
There is often like a lot of confusion in courtrooms, especially with like racism as a factor in the criminal justice system, these are very often going to be like charged trials, and as a result, wrongful indictments and wrongful imprisonments are you know something that can frequently happen.
Of course like if someone has just been like in life in prison, you can just take them out of prison and allow them to go back into society.
If you killed that person that's not really an option that's on the table.
At that point then we think it's important to just put people in prison for life rather than kill them, even if like the chance a small that they are exonerated by evidence, we think that is a massive massive injustice if somebody is innocent and is killed as a result of it.
IE you cannot reverse the decision.
Our third and final independent point concerns money.
So essentially we think that putting people on death row and engaging in capital punishment is incredibly costly.
The reason for this is that there's a lot of backlog in death row due to like the sorts of chemicals and things that are used.
We also think there's something to be said for like the humane the like the humanity aspect of whether or not these chemicals are like a actual peaceful way to die, but regardless of that we think they're very expensive.
The sort of regulations that are put on death row make it such that you have to put a lot of money into buying these chemicals, that you have to spend a lot of money keeping these people on death row because there's different security regulations and different like treatment regulations for people who are about to die, and in effect, because they spend so much time on death row they actually wind up being costlier than if you would just sentence them to life in prison.
Counter intuitively killing people and taking them out of the prison system actually costs a lot more money than just letting them stay in the present system indefinitely.
At that point then we think this is a system that is really harmful to the taxpayer, and at that point we don't think that it is a reasonable thing to keep in place because that is a specific articulable harm that is inflicted upon innocents just for the sake of being able to say that you killed the bad guys.
Proud to oppose.
Propose."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that private universities should be banned.
Three independent points.
First is that private universities by their nature often engage in predatory practices.
I think there's extreme examples of this of course you know for profit universities for example are notorious for this things like you know phoenix university which has had a slew of issues in terms of engaging in predatory practices where they promised much higher returns on investment than they actually deliver, that they are a for profit model and as such act the way that a company should.
But even nonprofit private universities still engage in predatory extortionary practices quite often.
Their incentives might not necessarily be to cut a profit but the structural reason why for profit institutions know do these things that are problematic can line up with nonprofit universities as well.
For example nonprofit universities might care very deeply about increasing their ranking and you know like college rankings at the national level so they might take steps to exclude students that are poorer out of risk out of fear of the fact that they might bring down the graduation rate of the school.
These are you know really problematic behaviors that we think that universitys' first priority should always be to ensure education for you know everybody at that university in a proper and quality education.
That's the priority said is best met by public universities because they're not accountable to you know shareholdersor board members or anything like that and as a result are most free to act with that mission intact.
Our second independent point is that by moving students from the private universities all into public universities you solve for the under investment problem that's currently plaguing public universities.
In the status quo, the majority of students in countries that allow them go to private universities.
There are some exceptions to this but if you look to the US for example which has a high amount of college students most of the students are at private universities especially when you look at the top tier of students.
This means in turn that there isn't a significant amount of public investment in the public universities because there just isn't as much demand for it.
However if suddenly everybody becomes reliant on the public university system to receive their degrees in link into their you know their long term prospects of receiving gainful employment, then I think becomes a lot more likely that you actually have a public university system that is properly invested in because that political pressure now exists.
Likewise I think if you just look to the status quo, one of the principal reasons that public universities are under invested in this because the stigma that surrounds their student base.
Racial stereotypes and class stereotypes dominate the discussion around these universities as you know not being worth the investment because their low graduation rates and things like that.
I think if you then you know shift away from that and you make them just sort of something that everybody goes through, there are a lot less likely to be stigmatized at that regard.
Our third independent point is contact theory, that is that when you get rid of the private universities you get rid of the segregation that currently exists within the college system.
I think right now a lot of people look at colleges as a great equalizer where people get to meet people from different backgrounds it's this wonderful experience where you know you wind up in very diverse circles as a result of the fact that everyone has brought together under this roof.
The problem though is that this is this is false that really you're not all being brought under one roof because the exorbitant price of a lot of private institutions, even the nonprofit ones, prohibits a lot of like genuinely impoverished students from achieving access to these universities.
This then is a serious problem because the contact theory that's supposed to be playing out on our campuses doesn't actually play out.
You have segregation really on class lines between public and private universities.
Housing all of these students under one roof then in the public system will allow for a much more genuine genuine intermingling, you have more contact between classes, you have that exposure to diversity that a lot of universities do seem to really prioritize right now.
Proud to propose."
"We should increase the use of personalized medicine.
So what we mean by personalize medicine is medicine that groups people based on their genetic characteristics and then uses those genetic characteristics to predict problems that an individual might have or special needs or treatments that they might need to seek out in the future.
We have a few reasons why we think that we should pursue more personalized medicine even if it's somewhat more expensive initially.
Our first argument is that this will greatly increase our understanding of human genetics.
Right now genetics is often approached to something that is useful in itself but not connected as much to the rest of medicine.
If we pursued this personalize medicine then we would first of all have much more information available because we'd have more data about people's genetics, but secondly, because we'd be looking for more connections between different parallel parts of people's genetic code.
This means that we'd be much more likely to actually find genetic causes for diseases that we might not fully understand right now and to predict the risks that people might have as they move forward in life much better than we're able to right now.
Ultimately, this would probably increase our understanding of genetics both from a scientific perspective, but also allow us to treat new diseases in the future using this information that we'd be gathering in the present.
Our second argument is that this would just lead to better medical outcomes.
Right now we tend to assume that everyone is genetically healthy, but this just simply isn't true.
Many people do have genetic predispositions to certain illnesses that mean that traditional treatments are not going to be effective.
In the same way that it's important that we don't understand that everyone has a particular problem or does not have a particular problem, it's often unclear how these problems arise and we can gain a better understanding of that from this personalized medicine.
But there are many illnesses that we can't even identify right now.
There are probably millions of people in the world who are diagnosed with general pain disorder or fibromyalgia or other illnesses that are kind of a catchall who in fact have a genetic disorder that we could probably treat with technology like crisper in the future.
So we're likely to get much better outcomes for patients in our world and this is very important because the purpose of medicine is ultimately to increase people's quality of life and to reduce suffering and the only way that we can do that is to increase our understanding and our knowledge but also to focus the technology that we have on treating patients.
Right now we've invested billions of dollars of research capital into genetics and it's time to start using that money to directly help patients rather than just work on basic science.
And our final argument is that ultimately this is going to lead to more preventative medicine which will drive down costs overall.
Why is this true?
If we can identify that people have a genetic predisposition to a particular illness that we can start working to mitigate that illness long in advance.
This has many advantages namely that people are going to suffer less but also that it's going to be less costly to treat them.
If you catch a disease early on, then it's easier to prevent it from ever getting really serious so that people don't have to spend lots of time in the hospital or get a caretaker or take expensive drugs because we can change their lifestyle or do other things to ensure that ultimately they're not at risk in this way.
This is going to tremendously drive down health care costs because preventive medicine is almost always cheaper than reactive medicine.
This is important for a few reasons.
Firstly, because government funds are fungible.
So if we save money by using preventative medicine, we can spend more money on treating other illnesses but also because there's a limited ability to treat certain people right now simply because of a lack of funds.
So many people could receive treatments that were previously too expensive if we were able to allocate money that would have gone to other people to them instead.
For all these reasons, we should increase the use of personal medicine.
Thank you."
"We should abolish standardized tests.
We're gonna do two things in this debate: firstly, we're gonna talk about how standardized tests look in the status quo and the actual tangible arms they have, and secondly we're going to talk about the principled reasons why we think standardized testing accounts for a poor, a poor standard for measuring performance in schools and why we think the philosophy behind doing so is generally detrimental regardless of the tangible impacts.
So firstly, the tangible impacts and what standardized testing looks like.
We think that the large amount of standardized testing is is currently runs through federal and state governments and is largely used as a metric for determining funding that will go to schools in the future.
We think that this is a horrible method of choosing state funding.
Largely because it ensures that the poorest performing schools, which are often the ones that have the highest need for increased funding, the highest need for new resources being poured into those school systems and the most need for help in improving the education of students in their lives.
We think that these tests ultimately lead to funding being cut for those institutions more often than not when we think that as a general detriment to those to those students.
Furthermore, we think that standardized testing, regardless of how funding works, ultimately has an impact on how teachers teach and how students learn in a negative way.
Firstly, we think that it forces teachers to teach to the test, regardless of whether or not funding is involved, because ultimately teacher performance is graded based on how they're perform on these standardized tests.
And what's crucial to understand is that these standardized tests ultimately oftentimes are things that students themselves are not able to adequately perform on for reasons outside of the teachers control, such as how well students are as test takers, how focused there on the test, how invested they are personally are sometimes things that teachers can't understand.
So we think that this specific method of standardized testing is a bad metric for measuring teachers but because they want to keep their jobs they ultimately are forced to try to teach exactly what's going to be on the material which means they can't do innovative things within the classroom to try and get more depth of understanding into their students but rather to make sure that you trudging along in their material to make sure that they'd hit every single thing that may be on a test, to try and give practice tests rather than giving extra teaching time to see how well students are doing.
All these things impact how a teacher teaches and ultimately ensures that the depth of education for students is much lower than otherwise would be if teachers had more flexibility and doing things like planning their curriculum and and deciding how they're going to teach and what they're going to teach their students.
More importantly, we also think that students have a negative impact in standardized testing because of the culture of testing.
We think it places immense burden on students to have the to mentally prepare constantly for these standardized tests.
We think that it can anxiety and make them feel like they're less worthwhile or that their future is in jeopardy if they don't perform well these standardized tests, which we think leads to environment within the education system that isn't hospitable and isn't comforting which we think only makes it more difficult for students to learn in the future.
Secondly, why we think that this is a bad metric for measurement?
We think that there are two metrics for measuring student performance: one of them is based on growth and improvement in performance and the other is based on proficiency, or having an understanding of general topics that need to be assessed.
Standardized testing deals with proficiency but we think that this is a worse metric.
We think that when you don't focus on proficiency, what you otherwise get is a system in which you track how well a student has done relative to their prior education.
We think that this corrects for the instances in which children don't have the same resources available to them, in which students are starting from a lower point than other students, which is often the cases in underperforming schools, and we think it allows teachers to truly show how well they perform and how well they're impacting their students' lives rather than the alternative in which students are seen poorly and teachers to seen poorly even if there is immense improvement, because these standardized test generally show proficiency rather than growth.
When you can't allow teachers and students to demonstrate how much they've learned and you force teachers into a box in which they're able to teach, we think that this is generally negative and we think that this is what standardized testing breeds.
And for this reason we think that you should abolish standardized tests."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should limit executive compensation.
What we mean by this is that we would tie executive compensation directly to the minimum wage.
So we would make it about like, let's say, fifty times the minimum wage, and no one could ever go above it if you are an executive at any kind of corporation, whether it's like economic or like, I don't know, manufacturing, etcetera, like if you hold the title of executive, you cannot make more than fifty times the minimum wage.
Three main areas of clash: first, on creating an incentive to raise the minimum wage.
Recognize that, currently, there is never an incentive to care about people who earn the minimum wage, because you are completely unaffected by their struggle.
Meanwhile, those who earn a minimum wage have the least political power to create change insofar as they often don't earn enough money to lobby or bribe or meaningfully contribute to political campaigns, but second, because they don't have the political networking that would allow them to be politically active in a meaningful manner.
Like, at the point that politicians tend to only care about how much money you can give them or whether they know someone who like who your parents went to college with or whatever, then we don't think there's a meaningful access point by which people who are below the poverty line or earning the minimal minimum wage can access that kind of representation.
But meanwhile, recognize that it allows for an abusive minimum wage that people can't live off of.
Like we don't think that if the minimum wage was tied in pennsylvania to like the amount of money that an executive makes, that it would still be seven dollars per hour.
Recognize that executives have a desire to earn as much money as possible, which means that they're actually going to be like willing to do things like lobby politicians, but more than this, they're actually the ones that have the ability to do so.
They're people who went to elite universities, and have like the monetary power, and often come from families that have money, and so can actually advocate for a higher minimum wage so their own salary goes up, and therefore having this like unintended but very positive consequence that the general minimum wage will increase.
Our second area of clash is about incentivizing more socially good careers.
We think that people rarely become executives because they are passionate about that field, rather they do it because they like the bonuses that come along with it and they like getting paid a lot.
These are like very intelligent individuals, and we think that their intellect would be preferably used in more socially beneficial fields, and if we removed the wage from the equation, they would be infinitely more likely to go into these comparatively better fields.
Like we think a lot of the time people who enter colleges feel pressure to pay off the college education they just spent on and also feel pressure to like fulfill a future in which they earn enough to be comfortable, then we think that oftentimes, when making that weighing calculus, the future wages are actually a really big deal.
So when you make those future wages comparable to other fields, such as social work or teaching or even science and doctoring, then you're necessarily more likely to go into those fields.
And those fields have the outside benefit of being incredibly good for like people and society overall.
We think that there's generally an oversaturation of executives right now, and we would prefer to like kind of thin out that crowd and redistribute the personal resources to fields that would need it more.
Our third argument is about the reallocation of company money.
Recognize that executives earn too much and thus, suck up a lot of company funds.
Like, oftentimes, any leftover profit tends to go rather than to like needs of the company or people who don't earn as much money in it, it goes to like massive holiday bonuses that feed executives' pocket.
We think that there's an incentive to keep everyone else's bonus and wages low and any kind of like company infrastructure unmet, because you're necessarily taking money out of your own pocket when you fulfill those other needs.
We think that we remove the only any personal investment in not giving money to other workers when we when execs recognize that their own salary cannot go higher than it currently is.
We think this means you necessarily pay other workers more and more money trickles down, and you're also going to do things like take on projects for the company itself, like opening branches in other places and rebuilding your like lounges, etcetera.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"Water fluoridation brings more good than harm.
The process water of fluoridation is the process of adding fluoride to municipal water, so that people in a community are able to have more fluoride in their system, which has numerous health benefits, primarily though to dental health, into allowing yourself to have healthy teeth.
So, we think that this is that this debate is about whether or not there are substantive impacts that occur because of this, and when we think, when you analyze that all the impacts are are beneficial for our side.
So, what do we mean by this?
Firstly, in studies of fluoride usage.
While certain studies have shown that the use of fluoride in water can be unnecessary, and there's disagreement about the exact amount of benefit, that comes from having fluoride in one's water, it's, universally almost, accepted that fluoride doesn't provide any sort of harm to the individual that's consuming that fluoride, that even if it doesn't have the dramatic health benefits that people previously had believed existed, there isn't some sort of massive harm to consuming fluoride.
It's not very easy to over overdose on fluoride, to have too much fluoride in one's system, especially because of the amount that this fluoride is distilled within the water.
People are able to avoid this fluoride, if they choose to do so, because you can, as an individual, choose to drink bottled water, choose to get water from your own your own like plumbing system, and you can have different ways of getting the water you need, if you want to avoid this fluoride in the first place.
But, given, but that is beside the point.
Because when you weigh these factors against each other, there's no negative aspect of fluoride that really impacts individuals.
And, we think that that means that definitionaly, fluoride must do more good than harm, because even if it only does immoderate amount of good physically, this is still on balance a net gain, and therefore it's more good than it does harm.
But, we want to take this a second step further about whether or not this is something that the government should be doing, whether or not there's an action that, in its philosophical sense, is more good than harm.
And in that regard, we still think that water fluoridation does more good than harm.
We think that the job of government is to provide benefits to the people that you govern, is to provide things, that ensure that their quality of life is better than it otherwise would have been, and to do it in a way, that restricts their freedom in the least amount possible.
And we think in in these regards, this checks off in all of them.
We think that fluoride is very cost effective to the consumer, it costs very little money, about a dollar per person, per year, to put water to put fluoride in the water, which we don't think for any any developed society is a really high cost, to cover this type of process.
People are able to avoid it, and even if they don't avoid it, even if they can't use their freedom to avoid it, it is, at worst, going to have a negligible health benefit in their development, in their health, and in doing so has no does not impede their freedom in any other regard, that they're going to try and use it.
So given that this is the case, we don't think that this is something that the government is unjustified in doing, and we think rather it is the job that the government should actively pursue, doing benefits for the people, and in attempting to do that through water fluoridation, we think that this is exactly what the government is meant to do, bringing a benefit that can help the people, especially something that's much more difficult to do on a person to person basis.
You can't just put fluoride in the water system on an individual level, it needs to be systemic.
And given that that's the case, we think that this is the right arena for the government to be operating in, we think it's the right action for the government to be taking, and that on balance, it certainly does more physical good than harm, and that water fluoridation overall brings more good than harm."
"We should fight for quebec's independence.
On our side we believe that quebec should be independent from canada and that they should be able to manage their own affairs like any other sovereign nation.
We have two main arguments for our side.
The first is about the nineteen nineties independence referendum that took place, and the second is about the right to sovereignty.
As you may already know, in the mid nineties quebec had a referendum on independence, and it was very very very narrowly defeated.
Let's talk a little bit about why that referendum was unfair and why that means quebec should be granted their independence.
After this federal government agreed to allow the referendum, they immediately started settling new immigrants in quebec as supposed to in other provinces.
They did this because they knew that immigrants to canada obviously want to live in canada rather than in quebec and therefore that these people would vote for quebec to remain in canada as opposed to leaving.
Generally speaking, quebec doesn't get a huge percentage of canada's immigrants because it speaks french rather than english and most immigrants have been learning french or english rather to move to canada.
So most immigrants would go to ontario or british columbia.
So the canadian government try to tip the scales in every way possible by settling these people in quebec who probably wanted to live in ontario or british columbia and who would have gone there otherwise.
They also did everything in their power to ensure that all english speakers would vote to remain in canada, such as running english language media that promoted voting to remain in canada.
They basically tried to divide quebec based on language lines as opposed to letting people make their own decision based on what's best for them.
They kind of stoked up the fear of the english speaking population in order to ensure that they would get what they want.
In other words we think that the canadian government played dirty.
We think that the canadian government should have been a neutral actor and should have stayed out of it and let actors who were pro and anti secession in quebec run the campaigns rather than spending millions and millions and millions of dollars from the other provinces in order to undermine a quebec independence.
And at the end of the day, despite all of this meddling, the poll came down or the referendum came down well within the margin of error.
So we think that it's very likely that independence would have won if the federal government hadn't interfered in this way.
So because the referendum was undermined by the federal government and because it would have won otherwise, we think quebec should be granted their independence since that's what would have happened after a fair referendum.
Secondly, we think that the quebecois people have a right to sovereignty.
A general principle we support is that nations deserve to have their own states if they want one.
The quebec quebecois people are a nation.
They have a common language and culture that's distinct from the rest of canada and they have a historical homeland in which they form a substantial majority.
In the same way that after world war one and two if we saw many nation states form in europe, in the same way that we saw israel become a nation state, in the same way that catalonia is probably going to become an independent state in the future, we think that quebec should be allowed to become an independent state.
It seems clear that the interests and needs of the quebecois people are not met by the english speaking canadian government which historically has oppressed them and tried to undermine their language and culture and religion.
Because of all of this historical enmity, and because it's unlikely that the government is ever going to allow them total independence and autonomy within canada, it's clear that quebec needs to become an independent sovereign state if they're going to maintain their language and culture.
You might ask why do they need to do that and we would say they have as much right to do that as any other people including english speaking canada.
In order to preserve this right to self determination and preserve their heritage, and because they were cheated during the last referendum, we should support quebec independence.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that sex education ought be mandatory.
What we mean by this is that in every high school across the united states, once you enter ninth grade there ought be a mandatory class that everyone must attend that covers topics such as birth control, STD prevention, consent, and like general physical features of the human body, all of this labeled under sexual education.
Two main areas of clash: the first on individual health.
We think that when sex becomes less taboo from initial conversation with adults, teens feel more comfortable asking for advice later.
You basically need to broach the subject once in order for them to feel comfortable doing it again later.
We think that sex education does this in a few ways.
First, it establishes an easy adviser.
A teacher who is able to provide students with a safe place in which they say, look I am teaching this to you, if you have any questions feel free to ask.
But it also gives students the words that they need in order to talk to parents more freely later.
Because it's hard to walk up to your parent and just say, what is sex when you don't really know what other questions you have to ask.
But when you are given the tools by which to communicate with others, you can come in with more directed questions.
So, is double bagging a condom good or bad?
How do I prevent myself from getting pregnant?
What are some easy ways to make sure I'm not pregnant afterwards?
All of these things are currently things that children spend hours researching on the internet and get told absolute falsehoods.
Such as that douching with soda water will somehow kill all the sperm that has entered them.
These things can be actively harmful to people's physical health and we prefer a world in which they feel more comfortable having these discussions with adults.
We also think that these kinds of educational classes set the stage for more healthy relationships.
When you know the physical anatomy of your own body and that of your partner, you're less likely to first be like physically harmful to yourself.
So understanding what is natural and unnatural with regards to when bleeding happens or whether things are supposed to hurt or feel uncomfortable, we think that this allows you to keep yourself safe physically when you are engaging in sex.
We also think it's less easy to get pushed into unprotected sex when you're when this kind of class can dispel myths.
So when you hear that it's not actually painful for men to have blue balls, when you hear that they'll be fine if they ejaculate into a condom because the sensitivity difference isn't that much, and when you hear that there's no actual way in order to guarantee the prevention of pregnancy after someone has ejaculated within you, you're much less likely to allow yourself to be in a situation in which he says, but I really want to and give into it.
We also think that it's easier to begin discussions of consent when you have a strong barrier in class that starts it, right?
Because when a lot of the time young students don't even understand what the concept of consent is, and until they are given the words that you have to say yes in order for this to be consensual, they don't actually understand what is happening to them in the real world.
Our secondary of clash has to do with societal benefits.
A more educated younger generation means healthier choices.
So if I know when to use a condom and when to not, if I'm fully educated in the way in which I use one, and on my options for birth control, you're very likely to see sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy rates decrease across society.
It also does things like begin dispelling rape culture.
When you have classes in which people can talk about each other's bodies and talk about what meaningful consent is, you're much less likely to have situations in which men feel like women are theirs to possess and women feel like that's okay.
More than this though, a coeducational environment teaches students about the other genders body.
We think that a lot of the time bad policies with regard that regulate women's health come from a general squeamishness about sex and gender.
And we think that when you decrease that squeamishness, you can change politics in the long term.
So, understanding the stages through which a fetus goes through lets you recognize that abortion is probably not unjust if that fetus is not really a person yet.
We think that sex education helps in incredibly large ways and thus it ought be mandatory.
Proud to propose."
"Single sex schools bring more good than harm.
So in this debate we're gonna be very clear, we're talking about all levels of education.
Primary school, secondary school and university.
And in terms of bring more good than harm we think that ultimately this is good for all of the students that go to these schools and society as a whole.
So our first argument is that we think that these schools are uniquely empowering to women.
Studies show us, and personal experience I'm sure will inform you as well, that women tend to speak up less in classroom situations than men.
Men often assert themselves more and speak more loudly and get called on more often by teachers.
So when you have single sex schools, it's more likely that women or girls get called upon and are able to express their opinions and learn directly from interaction with the teacher.
And we think that this is a way for women and girls to have opportunities in education that they otherwise wouldn't have as a result of boys being called upon or speaking over them in the classroom.
Second under this, we tell you that this provides unique opportunities for female leadership.
For similar reasons that boys tend to be more boisterous and that societies tells us that men should be leaders more so than women, we see that oftentimes clubs and teams are going to be in bed by boys more than girls in mixed sex schools.
So we tell you that when you have more opportunities for women and girls to fill leadership roles, for instance, at the elementary and secondary levels, that you're more likely to get women as leaders in the workplace and in government.
We see that many of the men who go on to be leaders in business or government were the presidents at their debate societies or the captain of their soccer team and we think the same would be true for women who would go on to be leaders as well.
But single sex education offers many more opportunities for women to have these leadership roles because boys aren't able to exercise outsize ability to take these positions from them simply by being loud or because of gender norms.
We think that this is a massive benefit for society as a whole because there's a shortage of women in government, in business or in these leadership roles, and single sex education could help to solve that.
Our last point in terms of why this uniquely empowers women is that we think this increases their access to different fields of study.
When you have a an integrated education system were boys and girls are together, we see that oftentimes boys are funneled toward science and engineering and math and girls are funneled towards english and literature and history and things like that.
Ultimately what this means is that girls are being funneled into the subjects that have fewer, low paying jobs.
This is part of the reason why women make less money than men in society.
It's not just a matter of the fact that women make less money for the same work then men, but also that from a young age women are encouraged to go into jobs that pay less money.
For instance, primary school teachers are most often women in the united states and that's a lower paying job than university professor, which is most often men.
So we think that you could break up the sort of track mentality at a younger age by having single sex education because the best math student will always be a girl, and the best science student will always be a girl, so these girls will naturally be sent on to universities where as women they'll have more opportunities to get into these high paying fields and to diversify them.
Our second argument is about general quality of education.
We think that this is less important than the last issue, that empowering women is the biggest issue in this debate, but that it still matters.
Firstly, we tell you that the single sex schools are likely to have better discipline.
Particularly for secondary school students we think that having a mixed sex school can lead to a lack of discipline.
Oftentimes especially boys will be distracted by girls or will behave inappropriately towards girls and this means that teachers have to spend time dealing with those problems and you know, there might be bullying and other issues that go on that would be less prevalent in a single sex school.
We also tell you that it's easier to target the specific needs of students.
Boys, for instance, tend to develop more slowly in elementary and primary schools.
So we see that you would be able to introduce new skills in a more age appropriate level for the different sexes if you had segregated schools.
So we think that for these reasons single sex schools bring more good than harm.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is: we should adopt libertarianism.
What this means is that, a world, in which the majority of people in governments adopt libertarianism, is preferable to the world we live in today.
Two many areas of clash, the first, on the role of government.
We tell you that, the primary role of the government is to protect the rights of those who live under it.
This is the case, because when a citizen pays into a system of government, through taxes, through voting, and through giving up certain rights, in order to gain protection from the government, they expect something in return, IE that protection.
Because recognize that, in a world without governments, my rights can be subverted by someone else, because they are stronger or more intelligent.
But, the value of an individual, insofar as we feel the same things, hear the same things, and are capable of the same emotions, is no lower than someone who's stronger, smarter.
As such, the governments exist as aggregations that protect the rights we are afraid of losing by chance.
We tell you that, the purest form of government is one that that, instead of impeding moral ideals, focuses on protecting the the rights of those who live under it.
Because, even if it's not always possible to actualize this, recognize that, there are often times that we need to violate certain rights, in order to protect others, like IE, it might be fair to ban certain types of guns, because we want to protect other people's rights to life.
It is preferable to get as close to this is possible, because it prevents government overreach in its purest form.
We tell you that, in the status quo, someone else's desires are constantly pushed on people through the government.
Recognize recently the FCC act that was passed.
It allows large corporations to sell our data.
We see this as an overreach of the government, because it is behaving as a moral actor, rather than just a protector of rights.
It is taking away our rights, in order to satisfy some monolithic being, that has desires.
But recognize that, this is wrong, because it subverts our rights, for a much lower order pleasure.
In so far as everyone is equal, we think that it is problematic when governments allow bodies to exert rights over others, and we tell you that libertarianism is an ideology that pushes themselves as far away as possible from this.
Moreover, we tell you that governments are not moral agents, insofar as every single person has a slightly different system of morality, and the government cannot represent them all.
It is preferable government remains unbiased, and focuses only on protecting rights.
We tell you that, libertarianism works with this, most of all, insofar as it dictates that the government ought to intervene as little as possible.
We tell you that this actualizes and crystallizes itself in the government being more of a protectorate, rather than a moral agent.
Our second area of clashe is about minimizing government intervention, and why it's good for people.
Because recognize that, oftentimes, the reason that we have policies that are interventionists, and impede on other people's rights, is because the government behaves like a moral agent, rather than distancing itself from intervention, and acting as a protectorate.
Things like abortion regulation, marriage regulation for gay couples, all of these are things that libertarianism avoids, because it states the government ought not act as an agent, but rather distances its intervention, and allow people to live as separately as possible.
We tell you that, recognizing rights is the primary motivator for a government, prevents the utilitarian game of: ' well, maybe this is economically preferable, and therefore it is alright to impede on rights ' because it sets the standard as rights being the most important, and is more willing to forego unnecessary pleasures.
Because my right to life is fore front, it is unlikely that a libertarian government is going to be willing to sacrifice that right, in order for it to create a temporary economic boom.
We think this is the current problem that our current governments fall into constantly, when they're willing to say: it's okay to create sub par human work conditions, in order to get more money in the long term for the economy.
It's for these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should increase internet censorship.
By this we mean that countries in which the internet is basically laissez faire and not regulated should introduce limits on what content people are allowed access.
For instance we see that recently britain has taken steps to limit people's access to pornography and we think that that's the kind of thing we're debating about here.
Not a sort of chinese system wherein people don't have access to most of the internet, but one in which the government filters certain content and I think the debate comes down to what that content ought to be.
Our first argument is about limiting access to obscene material.
Now I'm not going to defend the conservative ban in britain of pornographic material, but I do think that everyone can agree that things like child pornography shouldn't be accessible in any country.
I think that you can use internet censorship to make it more difficult for people to, one, access, and two, distribute child pornography.
In doing so, you also reduce the incentives for its creation.
Which means that you can reduce the amount of child abuse going on within and without your country.
We think that this is obviously a huge end and that even if you lose out on some legitimate content, the benefits that accrue by limiting child abuse greatly outweigh them so we're willing to bite that harm.
Our second argument is about radicalism online.
We see that since the early days of the internet, radical groups have used it to recruit members.
Whether that be al qaeda in the early two thousands, isis in recent years, or now the alt right and neo-nazis in america and europe today.
Isis for instance has used twitter as one of their main resources to get young men in europe to join their cause.
Attackers in france, belgium, and britain have all been found to be radicalized online.
We think that at that point, when certain material online poses a real threat to the safety of a nation, that it is acceptable to censor access to radical islamic materials.
If fewer young men had access to these materials, then fewer would become terrorists because this is the means by which they are being radicalized.
So we think that this is ultimately a tool to fight against terrorism.
But moreover, the alt right has used the internet as a way to legitimize their narrative about white supremacy, racism, and bigotry.
Because the internet acts as an amplifying chamber wherein a few, hardcore, neo-nazi types can seem much more popular than they are.
This draws people in to think that their message is normal and ultimately makes more people think that this kind of discourse is acceptable even though it isn't.
At the end of the day we think that it's worth it to censor access to this type of material so that people don't think that being a fascist is acceptable nowadays, when in fact of course it isn't.
And that the harms that these alt righters pose to democracy, ultimately makes it acceptable for the state to take extreme action, like censoring the internet.
Our third and final argument is perhaps a little less important than those but still matters to some people, namely private property violations on the internet.
Now many people are not sympathetic to the big hollywood movie studios and the big record companies who are losing money due to piracy, but remember that this also affects artists and independent labels and indie film houses as well.
At the end of the day, piracy has greatly reduced the profitability of music and film.
There's much less incentive to produce music and film, especially to take risks on new genres or new artists, if you know that the amount of profit you receive is going to be much lower than it was twenty years ago before widespread piracy.
We think that this disproportionately harms groups that haven't had access to the media production in the past.
That it's less likely that we'll see types of media targeting new groups or groups that pirate more often, such as low income people, because there's no money to be made if everyone just gets everything on the pirate bay.
So we think that it would be acceptable to censor websites like the pirate bay if it means that more people are consuming media legitimately.
For all of these reasons we think that we should increase internet censorship.
Thank you."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should increase immigration to the united states.
For the model this gets interpreted essentially as just increasing the number of people that we allow to immigrate annually into the united states.
We can do this through any number of means you know increasing the number of visas that we allow you know taking measures to increase you know you know citizenship procedures and speed up that process.
What we're essentially defending in this speech is to say that the current rate is below what it should be and that there are principled reasons why we should be allowing more people.
So three independent points.
First is the economic contributions made by immigrants.
In the united states there is not a lot of willingness of people that currently live here to do work that is perceived as being beneath.
Them.
This is things like you know food particularly in the agricultural industry but also in food processing also a lot factory work things like that.
But like factory work that's not like perfectly lining up with like the american dream and like coal mining like really really dirty factory work.
This is like largely a product of classism but regardless of what the cost is we've tried for a long time to solve it and get people to take these jobs and they often just don't.
Immigration is necessary then for fulfilling these jobs because people that come from cultures that you know are much more you know comfortable with poverty or not comfortable but you know have much more experience being poor and being forced to you know take this sort of work and are less likely to have these classist attitudes towards manual labor they're much more willing to fill these jobs.
And this is something that's economically necessary for the united states to meet the labor demand that we have right now.
If there are unfulfilled jobs then you have corporations that just don't work, you have trade systems that just don't work.
So this is you know something was really vitally important for the country.
Our second independent point is that this is actually something that helps immigrants themselves really significantly.
You know they're they're coming here because they are seeking a better life often fleeing persecution in other countries that are war torn or experiencing significant hardship.
People don't you know just get up and decide they're going to go to the united states just because they feel like it on a whim like they have good reasons for you know giving up everything where they're coming from basically, abandoning their home and coming to the united states.
It's because of that promise of a better life.
Insofar as this has really profound impacts on the individual and allows them to just live a better life, we think that that's a noble goal for the united states to pursue.
To allow people to live in in in a happier life without caring too much about your country of origin because this is something that really fundamentally matters to you.
Our third and final independent point is that there are just sort of structural reasons when you look at the status quo to see why it is why we are letting less people in than we really probably should.
It's obviously impossible to pin down what the exact number of immigrants coming into the country should be like what is the maximally reasonable number but the only real constraint on this should be how many people we can feasibly support basically.
I think we're doing it just fine though with the current rate like if you look at the the current constraints on immigration it's largely a political constraint that comes from the far-right.
That is asserted xenophobic attitude towards people entering like that's what keeps visa rates low and things like that.
And at that point I think it is eminently reasonable to say these are artificial constraints, these aren't actually rooted in any sort of rational principle and at that point I think we should strike down these constraints and try to normalize a bit.
Again it's not really possible to say what the exact number should be but I think the fact that the current constraints are artificially constructed by xenophobic attitudes demonstrates that the rate that we're looking at right now is you know not reasonable.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should prohibit slum tourism, slum tourism being the act by which tours of usually wealthy people go into like slummy or less like more underprivileged, less wealthy neighborhoods to look at the way that the poor live and like take pictures, etcetera.
So, two main areas of clash, the first on why we think it is problematic that it benefits from the suffering of others and not only benefits, but actively often harms the people while benefiting.
We think it's important to set a framework by which you understand who exactly is benefiting from these kinds of tours, because we think it's never the case that this money somehow goes down to the people living in these areas, that somehow it actively helps people that there are tour buses moving through their cities.
The truth of the matter is that a lot of the time these tours are run by large corporations that pocket the money coming out of the tours, and never give anything back to the community.
At most, you get a couple of dollars trickling out per tour back into these slums but in the majority of situations, they get nothing, rather you're just helping these large corporate corporate tours grow and profit.
We think the benefits also go to the rich people who get to wander around these locations.
They get to look around, feel like bit feel like they're getting a different view of the world, without having to actively spend very much or give back to these communities or become a part of these communities and truly understand their suffering.
They get to be passing by and looking through the window.
We think the problem is that the people who are who are the who are at the core of this, the people who are getting looked at, the people who live in these neighborhoods, get nothing out of it.
Not only does the money not go to them, but it's also that they get actively harmed.
They're they are looked at by by people who are richer as though they are exotic.
It is degrading to their to them to be like animals in a zoo for the pleasure of those who are richer.
We think these tours exoticisize poverty and degrade the people in these areas, and that is unacceptable and ought be prohibited.
Our second area of clash has to do with gentrification.
We think that a lot of the time these kinds of tours draw attention to low income areas and draw rich people into them in a way that gentrifies and ultimately pushes out those of lower income.
We think exoticisizing the area attracts younger people for who, for two reasons, decide to settle nearby: either they think that they can help the area to grow and flourish and reach their conception of what a good area or a healthy neighborhood would look like, or they think it's cool to live around slums.
They're hipsters who want to feel like they are up and coming in this area.
We think the problem is that even the most well-intentioned of people who are moving into these area push the costs of living up.
They compete with with those who are already in the area for housing costs and because they can afford afford a higher cost, they often push the prices of houses up for everyone else.
They want their groceries to come of a higher standard and thus have a higher price, so what once was a stop and shop becomes a whole foods, and they push local businesses out because once local businesses can because once bigger businesses can see that they can make a profit in this area where they previously could not, they buy out the leases of those that are preexisting.
Slowly the area becomes gentrified and those people are pushed out.
The problem with pushing those who are poorer out is that there's not really a place for them to go.
We think this is another example of destroying an established community without ever giving back to them and benefiting off of their suffering.
We think it's a problem that what happens on their side of the house is the romanticization of poverty, the destruction of people's communities, and then the subsequent continual ignoring of there actually being a problem.
We think it is preferable then to just leave these communities alone.
Never touch them in the first place because at least then, you're not actively destroying what they're built.
For these, reasons proud to propose."
"We should prohibit slum tourism.
We believe that slum tourism is degrading to human beings and that it creates a false sense of solvency amongst those that tour these slums.
People go to the areas and believe that for some reason, because they've gone, because they spend some money there, because there's now this industry of tourism in the area, and because they become aware of these issues, that suddenly there is some sort of solvency involved in these issues.
Because they're able to escape those issues and move on and go back to their lives as they were beforehand while people live in squalor.
So that we're going to talk about in this round.
So firstly on why these this is degrading to human beings.
Slum tourism, in its very nature, treats human beings and their struggle as entertainment rather than as people that are actually suffering the degradation that slum living causes them to endure.
We think that people shouldn't view these other individuals, these other people whose lives have the same inherent amount of value as their own, despite their inequality in class level, we think that these people shouldn't be forced to be used as some sort of social experiment, as some sort of freak show in the way that they live their lives.
We would also say that this doesn't actually build empathy between those people that are touring and those people that live in these areas because they're not interacting with these people and a genuine setting.
They're not going into these people's lives and really coming to understand the struggle they live, but also seeing them as human beings outside of their struggles, outside of their poverty.
They don't do this at a long term manner.
There's no way to see growth in these people, to see changes in these people, to understand them as human beings as we would understand our friends as human beings, because we've been able to grow with them and see them change.
And they only see them as poverty.
As the human encapsulation of poverty.
Another way in which these people are are degraded because of this form of tourism.
And finally, people in these slums don't actually get any real money from from this tourism.
Yes, some wealthy people will be able to spend some money in these areas, and some small markets or some small store owners or these types of people may be able to make some amount of money, but as far as the vast majority of the people in these slums, they're not getting the money from this tourism industry, they're not getting this money from the tourist industries that run these tours, they're not getting money from the airports and from the air and from the the flights that these people take to go into these areas.
Most of the money goes to areas in which people are already wealthy.
So, it's using people that are in poverty to make those that are rich, richer.
We think that that is incredibly degrading to the struggle that these people go through and is a moral bad that we should not allow.
Finally, on a false sense of solvency.
As I explained, people believe that they become familiar with the issue and because of that they give maybe a little bit of money, but then they think they've done their part.
They think that they've gone through some sort of process that not only transformed them because of how they are now enlightened about the struggle of other people in the world, but also helped those people who's struggle they have become aware of.
But they don't take any real steps once they have this feeling the fulfillment.
Their likes and what this means is that they're less likely to take tangible steps in the future.
In a comparison between people that feel they have the sense of accomplishment and people that may not be aware of the struggle but don't feel the sense of accomplishment, we think people that are unaware are more likely to become aware through a better mechanism, through a way that doesn't give them this false sense of solvency, and then make serious changes than those who are already aware, have this false sense of solvency, are to actually change the situation.
For these reasons, we should prohibit slum tourism."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should further exploit natural gas.
By we we mean the US government, by exploit is that we think that like a significant amount of current resources that are used to buy oil from other countries or used to frack for oil in within the united states we would prefer would be used to exercise efforts to further like take out natural gas and like extract natural gas within the united states domestically.
With that, two main areas of clash, first on whites better for the environment.
Look obviously green technology is the ultimate goal like we would prefer a world in which everybody drove hydrogen cars that like used hydrogen gas to power them and produced water but the problem is that this is a world that is relatively far away and we live with an ever growing need for a different source of energy and one that is preferably cleaner than the current things that we have.
Like at the end of the day, oil is running out and it's probably not the case that hydrogen cars are developed enough for those to become the replacement so in the interim we need something that can be that can like serve us without forcing us to change all of the technology that we have pay like expect the average consumer to pay a lot of money to upgrade to a car that like that that like is experimental vastly in technology.
So I mean emmissions wise it's really important to note that natural gas is significantly less dirty than oil and other kinds of forms of energy that we've been using.
This is just like something that is like a characteristic of the compounds and so we've noticed that like cars that drive using natural gas produce less harmful emissions into the environment and don't contribute to global warming as much.
But it's also more environmentally friendly in terms of efficiency because recognize that like the rate at like the amount of time that you can like use the same gallon of gas also determines how much needs to be produced using methods like fracking that can often be damaging to the environment so if we're able to like use the same gallon for longer for more mileage that's preferable because it means that less has to be extracted per person which is necessarily environmentally friendly.
So we think at the point that natural gas is an also more efficient form of energy that is also preferable.
But our second area of argumentation is about why it's economically positive.
First it's good for the US specifically in that we have for a very long time relied on the middle east to supply to supply our energy needs because we personally did not have enough oil and had more environmental regulations on areas that did have oil and so we couldn't access them ourselves.
The difference here is that we have tons of natural gas and this allows to cut down the dependency on these four nations which is really good because for a really long time we were facing mass amounts of pressure from these countries to ignore their human rights abuses to ignore their antisemitism on the like the idea that we need we need them for gas and we can't afford to have them cut us off.
So once we are allowed to cut down on that dependency we're able to be politically free like maybe we're really tired of saudi arabia mistreating women and punishing people too harshly so now that we don't rely on them for the majority of our energy we're actually capable of expressing that through the use of sanctions or anything else.
We also think that it's like allows us to become an exporter which is something that is really positive in terms of energy because when you become an exporter you to also set the price on things like natural gas especially since very few other countries are able to export it to the same degree as we are because they have less access to it and have less like allocated market so we think it's actually really good when the united states gets to do things like say like look like now by our gas because it necessarily makes us richer but it also just creates a massive amount of jobs domestically and we think this is really important not just because jobs are generally good and we like it when people are able to earn their own money and contribute to the economy but also because of our existing in a world for automation is happening in amazingly high rates the same time more immigration is also happening to peak with refugees coming across borders so we actually it's really important that you're creating jobs that you don't necessarily need to be incredibly educated for but will still be able to provide for you.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"I'm proud to stand a proposition of today's motion that we should abolish the american jobs act.
To independent points: first is that the protections that were granted by the bill against hiring discrimination are harmful to the market and that we should roll them back.
So what the american jobs act did in terms of hiring discrimination was create a statute that banned discrimination in hiring against people based on their employment status.
That is if someone was unemployed, and basically employers sort of smelled a rat based on that, that they saw as a signal that people could not hold down a job and as such that they were less willing to hire them.
That that was an unjust reason to fail to hire somebody and as such that employers could not do that anymore.
I think the problem with this logic, however, is that it insists that employers just use this as an auto red stamp.
That being someone who is currently unemployed means that you just like cannot get a job.
I don't think that's true though, because I think it is reasonable to use this as a factor.
Unemployment is a signal.
Like it is a signal that someone was not able to hold down a job for a decent amount of time or even if it was something out of their control, like a recession, it means that they as opposed to other people in the country lost their job.
I think that's telling for a lot of companies.
Because it means that this person was probably a worse worker than other people at the time.
This is a problem then, that we are not allowing employers to make decisions based on that basis because it is a legitimate reason to think that someone might not be as qualified as another applicant.
It doesn't constitute an automatic x, but I really just don't think employers are doing that.
Is not a way in which employers take a look at an applicant say: "" oh you were unemployed previously therefore there is no way I will hire you "", rather they are much more inclined to say: "" okay, this is one reason why I am suspicious of this individual and one reason why I am less inclined in the comparative to hire this person. ""
But it is not an automatic disqualification.
My second independent point is that the tax cuts intrinsic to the policy don't work.
So, one of the main ways in which the american jobs act really tried to get by and was sort of the underpinning of the bill was a large amount of tax cuts.
Specifically tax credits for the long term unemployed as well as tax cuts on payroll tax cuts on payroll taxes, and as well as some other small business deregulation that resulted in some tax cuts as well.
This is all a problem.
Because the underlying logic for this is that essentially: "" oh well if we don't tax people they'll be more capable of working and then by extension those people will sort of have more economic activity which in turn will generate more tax revenue.
The problem is that this is been tried before.
In fact, that this is exactly what's going on right now in kansas and it's not going particularly well for kansas.
In fact, there is a economic basis for this called the laffer curve, that the philosophy behind it is that this exists on a gradient.
That if you tax people all of their wealth though stop working in you won't get any tax revenue, and if you tax none of them then you won't have any money to spend on social services.
So the ideal spot is somewhere in the middle.
The problem is that this bill's underlying philosophy is just: "" oh well median must be lower taxes than the status quo. ""
But there's no basis for making that proclamation.
And I think the long term what that results in then, it's just less tax revenue to spend on things like the social services that are actually the way in which we ensure that people can get their jobs back.
That's how you create the jobs programs.
That's how you create the infrastructure spending.
That's how you create the welfare benefits.
And I don't think you're going to be able to sustainably create those programs and continue to fund them without a steady tax stream.
Proud to propose."
"Global warming is a major threat, not just a major threat, it's an existential threat for three reasons.
First, because basic human habitability of our planet is on the line.
Second, mass starvation is on the line.
And third, super-powerful, wide damaging, natural disasters will be more frequent and more destructive, all things that are quite bad and certainly constitute major threats.
So let's start by talking about basic habitability.
Global warming is going to lead to glaciers melting and ice caps melting, and it's estimated that sea levels are going to rise as a result of this.
It's a phenomenon that we've already started to see happening.
So this is a problem because most people live on the coast.
You look at major population centers in the united states, for example.
You look at places like new york, boston, miami, florida, washington DC, you look on the west coast, you look at places throughout california, you look in places like in you look at places in like europe.
This is also a phenomena.
Tel aviv is on the water as well.
This is going to be a big problem.
So, these places can be under water if there's too much flooding.
There could be widespread flooding.
Parts of these cities can be uninhabitable, or entire sections can be uninhabitable.
For context of what this looks, like you could essentially imagine the devastation in new orleans after hurricane katrina where the entire area was flooded.
Imagine that but everywhere, and imagine that everywhere constantly and not just sporadically when there's a rare natural disaster like that.
This is quite bad and it will make basic cities that we've had unlivable.
This at worst means that everything that we've previously built there is going to be unusable and we're gonna have to leave.
So that's like very very bad.
At the best-case scenario you can imagine is that it's going to cost incredibly large amounts of money to fix this problem, things that we probably don't even have the access to, building levees across an entire nation, things like that.
But, an additional problem is the idea about starvation.
So, a lot of food can't grow outside of specific temperature rains ranges.
So if it gets too hot, wheat won't grow.
If it gets too if it gets too cold, maybe like fruit will stop growing or vegetables will die.
So this becomes a big problem because through global warming, you're also going to see a continued desertification as well.
So you're going to be seeing that certain like soil nutrients are gonna be more lacking.
So in addition to like temperature range going on, you're also going to see soil entire soil areas be less conducive to growing.
So a concept of what this looks like is you could look at things like the dust bowl in you could look at like dust bowl problems in oklahoma.
You could think about trying to grow an orange tree in the sahara desert or trying to grow wheat in the sahara desert.
It's probably not going to work very well for you.
Imagine this is a global phenomena.
Food is going to be more expensive and it's going to be less available.
This will lead to billion like millions of people dying probably, something that's very bad.
But finally, it's important to focus on natural disasters.
When you're talking about natural disasters, it's no secret that we've had record-high temperatures, and we've also had heat waves that have killed people.
So you look at the recent heat wave in pakistan that resulted in numerous deaths.
When you look at hurricanes, they're more vicious than ever, that are going to completely rip apart places.
When you look at storm surges that have never been as high before, when you look at historically destructive winters like the one that we had in boston a couple of years ago, these things are happening at a greater frequency than they ever had.
And these things happen because of climate change, because increases in temperature make it so that hurricanes can be more destructive and they can grow more frequently.
When you look at record cold, these things are global warming is not necessarily the most precise term, climate change is a better term, and oftentimes these things happen as a result of that.
This obviously can result in mass human casualties, mass infrastructural damage, mass like work in lack of productivity in a lot of contexts, all things that are quite bad.
So for all of those reasons, global warming is an incredibly major threat."
"School vouchers are beneficial.
So basically, the way that school vouchers work is people pay the normal taxes that they would pay that goes towards a fund, but parents have the option to rather than send their child to a neighborhood school, send their child to another school by turning in a voucher.
So that might be a charter school which is a kind of semi private school that started by a private group but funded by the state and held to certain government standards, or even a private or parochial school we're perfectly fine with people using these vouchers at catholic schools for instance, on our side of the debate.
So, two arguments for why these are beneficial.
The first is about maximizing individual choice.
We think that broadly speaking, governments or an institution that limits people's freedom we see that, you know in a state of nature, parents would presumably have the freedom to send their children to any form of education that they wish, with no intervention from anyone else.
That would be a state of maximum freedom.
Now obviously, we want to guarantee certain minimum standards and we want to be sure that children are being educated well enough to become functional citizens, so the state has a clear interest in limiting people's freedom in some respect, in as much as it requires them to have their children get an education.
But we don't think that government needs to intervene at the level of deciding which school the children go to.
We think that if parents want their children for instance to get a catholic education, ultimately that's not the concern of the government.
These people who come out of catholic school are just as able to be functional citizens.
The people coming out of charter schools are just as able to be functional citizens anyone else.
They can get jobs, they have all the skills that we care about, so it's not really our concern whether they have a religion class twice a week at the end of the day, and I think that that's really the comparative.
The other team might try to tell you that some charter schools are like this unregulated libertarian nightmare, but if that's the case we think that the solution to this problem is to regulate schools better, not to get rid of vouchers.
We think that by maximizing choice you also empower parents.
We think individual parents probably know what's best for their child better than the government.
Recognize that lawmakers can't consider what's best for every individual child.
Imagine if you had a kid for instance was being bullied in their neighborhood school, who needed to go into a different school to get away from that but their parents didn't have enough money to afford it, we think that vouchers could be a really powerful tool there.
We also think that if you had children with special needs those might be better met at a different school farther away than in your neighborhood, and school vouchers again could be a way to maximize choice in that respect.
So this would ultimately maximize freedom, and be better for children with special needs are who are facing special circumstances.
Our second argument is about integration and access.
We think it's likely that charter schools will be much more diverse than neighborhood schools.
Most people probably live in neighborhoods where their neighbors are similar to themselves.
The neighborhood I grew up in, most people were white americans, for instance.
I think that's probably true everywhere in the world people live with people who are similar to themselves given the choice.
It's unfortunate but true.
With that in mind though, we think that you would get more integration of people from different racial, ethnic, religious, cultural, language backgrounds, through these schools, because if anyone could turn in these vouchers then you'd probably have something like a lottery system, and you would have students who were from an immigrant background or hispanic or black or white, going to the same schools.
And we think that this would ultimately lead to a society where more people were empathetic towards those who are different from themselves because they're socialized with them at a young age.
And in terms of access, I think that these vouchers increase the access to really good schools for low income students.
Unfortunately right now there's a tendency that wealthy areas have good schools and low income areas have bad schools.
But with these vouchers if you're a parent and you know that your town doesn't collect a lot of tax revenue, so your private sorry, public school isn't that good, you can send your child to a better school, ensure that they get a better education, and ultimately we think it's more likely that those children will go on to get back to their community and help to make this a rising tide that lifts all boats kind of things, by investing that education in helping others, or at least that they're more likely to do so than people from outside the community.
So for these reasons, school vouchers are beneficial.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should increase immigration to the united states.
We're going to go all out here and say the way we're gonna implement this is through something like open borders.
Two main areas of clash: the first, on the obligation of the united states as a western liberal democracy and specifically as the united states.
First and foremost we think there's an obligation to recognize freedom of movement is a fundamental human right.
Before I get into what makes it a fundamental human right, I think it's important to establish the human rights exist outside of the states states and those laws that you're under.
Weeding that rather this comes from something that is innately human about us as individuals.
We see this in situations such as, even if like, in a different country such as, like even if germany decided to fundamentally a bridge things like property rights, even when we see something like in syria - where there are human rights abuses with regards to like shooting your own citizens, even though these are different countries that operate under different law systems, we still denounce these practices because we don't respect sovereignty above our respect for fundamental human rights.
Now that we've established that, let's talk about why movement specifically is a human right.
We think that insofar as movement is facilitative to me filling out any other of my rights, AKA I cannot fulfill the right to life, the right to the pursuit of happiness, anything else that we recognize as fundamental, unless I can move to the places that allow me to do so or move enough to I don't know, if there's a job somewhere that will like let me self actualize better than what I'm currently doing.
Unless I can move there I have no way of fulfilling them.
Insofar as that's all like, that is the only way I can access my other rights, we think it has to be considered a human right.
But more than that, we think that birth place itself especially arbitrary.
Insofar as I didn't choose whether to be born in mexico or the united states, whether to be born to a drug addict or to a doctor, we think that it is fundamental to being a human that you ought to be able to change your situation in any way possible.
And that if the states abridge this right they are bridging your ability to find equality regardless of where you are born.
We think that the foundation of what the united states is built on even more so makes it a requirement for the US to recognize this.
Insofar as the US is a country of immigrants, a country that gloats upon the idea of being built by people who escaped from their own countries, we think that because of this, the US specifically ought recognize this.
We think that when we don't see it as a human rights violation, it, when we don't see this as like a fundamental human right we force people to stay in unpleasant situations, thus committing human rights violation ourselves.
Our secondary of clash has to do with the pragmatics.
First, let's talk about innovation.
Because we think that when we allow youth and other people to come in from other countries, in a state where our population is aging dramatically dramatically faster than we are having children, we are increasing the amount of power and minds that are coming in and working in industries and contributing to the innovation of the nation.
We think that this increases collaboration between groups that think incredibly differently.
The way that I was taught to approach problems and view my life and my career here in the united states, is very different from the way that we approach society and careers in other countries such as russia or china.
We think that because this allows better communication between these different groups, it is necessarily good to increase immigration.
We also think that brilliant cultures come in from other countries.
Things that we've never experienced before contribute to things like food, festivals and other beautiful things.
Finally, on economics we think that low skilled labor increases competition and cheapens goods.
Currently, the problem in the united states is that corporations are either outsourcing to other countries or making their goods incredibly expensive, because they have to either pay a lot for they have to pay a lot for labor.
We think that when you bring in low skilled labor, the competition for who will who will accept the lowest wage increases and requires necessarily that goods prices go down.
We think in the end a lot of the time immigrants to the job that american citizens just don't want, and fulfilling these jobs is good for the economy.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"We should end mandatory retirement.
So, right now, in many countries, such as germany, people have to retire when they reach a certain age, like sixty-five.
We think that people should be able to continue to work as long as they do a satisfactory job and meet their employers' expectations, which is already the status quo in some other countries, like the united states.
So, with this in mind, we have three points for our side.
First, we think that mandatory retirement is discriminatory against the elderly.
We think that presumably these are people who want to continue working for whatever reason, at the point where they're being forced to retire.
People who want to retire are outside the scope of this debate, because they'll continue to do so either way.
We think that there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to work, given that you wish to do so.
Just because of your age, it seems arbitrary as a standard.
If you're forty-five or sixty-five, either way you might have bills to pay that you need to work to fulfill, or you might enjoy your job or find it personally fulfilling and want to continue it.
We think that you shouldn't discriminate against people who are sixty-five while you let those four forty-five do what they want.
We think that ultimately, the state needs to treat people fairly regardless of intrinsic characteristics, that is to say, things that are beyond people's control.
In the same way that we don't think that latino people and white people should have different standards for one when they're allowed to work, neither should people of different age groups.
Our second argument is that we think that mandatory retirement actually harms the work force and institutions.
So realize that, presumably, these are people who aren't being asked to retire in the status quo.
Because imagine right now that we have, I don't know, a manager in an office who isn't doing a satisfactory job because of their age, that person could be asked to retire or resign in the status quo because they aren't doing their job well.
So the only people that this debate is about is people who are still performing their job in a satisfactory way, and we can imagine many careers where people could work well into their seventies and still do a good job, such as university professors.
So at this point, we tell you that these institutions are losing out on workers who are doing such a good job that the company wants to keep them on.
We think that, ultimately, individual companies or universities or other employers better know who ought to be hired and who ought to be fired than the government.
As long as we protect against discrimination among employers, we think that ultimately they should have the final say on who they employ.
Because some government bureaucrat, who looks at the numbers on a piece of paper about a person, can't see if they contribute lots of unique experience or values or leadership in the office that might be lost if that person were forced to retire.
We think that ultimately, it's likely that you access things like leadership uniquely when you keep older people around because they have seen more problems arise and better know how to cope with them, and also because of the respect that they command within the workplace.
Our third and final argument, which I hinted at earlier, is that there's no fair standard for mandatory retirement.
Some countries, like germany, have one age for basically everyone, but this seems unfair because different jobs have different requirements.
It probably is true that you can't be a stone mason into your seventies because physical fitness would prevent you from doing so.
But why can't you be a university professor or a newspaper reporter, when those jobs are things that primarily rely on your thinking ability rather than your ability to do physical labor.
We tell you, ultimately, that you could make different standards for different types of employment, but then that discriminates against people in certain career paths.
We think that in order to win the debate, the other team needs to explain to you what a fair, clear standard is.
We tell you that if it's different ages for different careers that that's arbitrary, and so is one age for every career.
So we don't think that they'll be able to meet this burden.
For these reasons, I am proud to suggest that we should end mandatory retirement.
Thank you."
"We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons.
In this round, we're gonna make three main arguments about why we think that nuclear weapons are both unnecessary in our current world and incredibly dangerous to the survival of our species.
So, first, we would say that nuclear weapons are an essentially pointless weapon.
So let's break down that argument.
We think that a weapon is something that is ultimately supposed to be used for self-defense.
It's something that prevents other people from inhibiting your ability to live your life in the way that you see fit.
It's a way of protection.
It's a way of deterrence.
But the problem with nuclear weapons as a weapon, in this sense, is that there's no self-defense that is generated from these nuclear weapons, because there's no way to use these nuclear weapons in a way that won't invoke an attack against you that ultimately harms yourself.
We think that this is just clear by the state of the world as it is today.
There are international experts, there are people in the international sphere in public policy that fear that, in certain regions, hot spots could erupt that could decimate the world.
And it's not just if these regions, such as the india-pakistan border, it's not just if these two countries decide to have a nuclear war against each other that they're only harming themselves, but they harm the entire world.
If you launch hundreds of nuclear weapons back and forth across a border, you create nuclear fallout that affects the entire region and, in fact, the entire world.
It's a pointless weapon in the sense that it doesn't do anything to meaningfully deter action, because it doesn't deter conventional warfare, it only deters additional nuclear weapons.
So it's a it's a weapon that deters itself and, essentially, you could create the same effect of deterrence by just abolishing all nuclear weapons.
And the other issue one of the other issues, though, and our second point, is that these weapons are incredibly dangerous, because they can because one accident can lead to this sort of nuclear fallout globally.
If one person makes a mistake, if one nuclear weapon is launched accidentally, there's no time, there's there's no reaction that's going to stop nuclear weapons from being fired in response.
If the united states were to accidentally launch a nuclear weapon at russia or at china, we don't think that russia or china would just allow that nuclear weapon to decimate millions of people and damage its population and cause real destruction in its country without some sort of repercussions, and we think that that is almost certainly going to escalate in the in a sense of mutually assured destruction, which is, again, the premise of this weapon.
The premise is that it is such a powerful weapon, it is such a dangerous weapon that it can deter other people from using that weapon against you.
But at the end of the day, if that is the point of it, to deter the weapon from being used on other people, we would just have we would prefer a system of abolition, especially because of our third argument which is that in many places, especially the united states, the infrastructure surrounding nuclear weapons is incredibly outdated.
The infrastructure that we use in the united states in our nuclear weapons facilities is the same infrastructure that we had during the cold war era in the nineteen fifties.
You have people using floppy disks and people using computers that were developed in the nineteen fifties.
These are things that are not incredibly sophisticated, and they're prone to glitches.
In fact, there are a number of times in recent US history in which nuclear weapons were almost accidentally used, in which in and not even used against foreign nations, where these things are being transported and there is an accident that could have easily caused the nuclear weapon to explode.
And then, again, if a nuclear weapon were to go off in the united states, the united states would likely have to find some foreign actor to blame for that incident and, again, cause this nuclear war that would be so destructive to the public.
The infrastructure is outdated, the purpose of the weapon is nonexistent, and for these reasons, we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons."
"We should adopt teacher tenure reform.
So this debate is about tenure for primarily secondary school teachers in countries like the united states.
Presently in many school systems, like the one in chicago, teachers have tenure.
Which means that after they've worked at a school for a certain number of years they can only be fired for sort of gross misconduct.
Otherwise, generally speaking, they keep their jobs no matter how well they perform or what they do.
Two arguments for why we need to reform teacher tenure.
And by reform we mean make it easier for principles or school boards to remove teachers who have been at a school for a long time.
So two arguments.
First: this aligns the incentives of teachers with those of society and allows us to reward good behavior.
What do I mean by this?
Right now if you're a teacher who has tenure you don't really care if your students are succeeding.
Maybe you're a good person and you became a teacher for pure motives, and we certainly think that's the case for most people, but there are also people who become a teacher and don't really care if their students learn anything.
Maybe they just read out of the book in class or they show movies, etcetera.
But we tell you that by introducing tenure reform, suddenly you can make it so that teachers only succeed if their students succeed.
In other words you can attach things like salary increases or job security to certain performance by students on standardized or local testing.
What this means is that suddenly teachers have every reason to try to teach as best as possible.
Right now the only motivation that teachers have is intrinsic.
To do a good job because they care about the kids.
In our world, suddenly there's extrinsic motivation as well.
Namely the possibility of gaining bonuses or having job security.
And as an aside from this I'd like to point out that in our world we can reward good teachers.
We don't just have to punish bad ones.
We can give people bonuses if all of their students get into college, things like that.
Something that can't happen right now because tenure prevents us from awarding the good teachers as well because we're spending all of this money on the bad teachers.
And this leads nicely into my second argument about how this would improve the financial state of schools.
So the way that teachers salary generally works is you start out making a pretty low salary and then if you stay at the same school for a long time eventually you make a very high salary.
So what that means is that right now we have lots of elderly teachers who don't have a lot of incentive to care about the students who are collecting large paychecks.
Meanwhile there might be younger teachers who are better qualified or more able to actually invest themselves emotionally in helping their students who can't get jobs because we can't fire these older teachers.
We have to wait for them to retire.
So in our world we tell you that first of all, we could lay off teachers who are not performing and hire new teachers which would save money because we're getting more bang for our buck, so to speak, from a better teacher.
But on top of that, that it's more likely that we could hire young teachers to replace older ones who are no longer, you know, up to date on a certain field or no longer performing at a high level.
This is some huge impacts because money is so fungible within the school system.
If we spend less money paying bad teachers, and recognize, this isn't just a matter of paying someone ten thousand dollars more than someone else to teach algebra.
There are teachers in new york who can't be fired but who are so bad that they sit in a room all day and get paid for it.
To do nothing.
So we can get rid of people like that and reinvest that money into hiring people like special needs teachers, like ESL teachers, to fill gaps that we have right now in our education system.
At that point we think this will be a clear good for the children who should have our foremost consideration, because education exists to benefit them and secondly for the school system as a whole, because they can allocate resources more effectively.
So for these reasons we should institute teacher tenure reform.
Thank you."
"We should ban school uniforms.
School uniforms serve essentially no purpose outside of what regular regulation on clothes would actually do.
We think that you can prevent things like gang signs on clothes, scantily clad clothes, using basic regulation, but forcing uniformity through a uniform is far more likely to impede the ability for students to freely engage with one another and to essentially express themselves in the best way possible.
To that end, we would support the following model: that in the united states, no school be allowed to force all children to wear the same outfit, even if it's with just within their gender.
We are not going to say that schools cannot regulate exactly what children wear when they're actually saying what's not allowed.
We think that stopping people from just wearing their underwear or wearing slurs on their shirt is probably good policy, but if they want to express this sort of uniformity, that would be banned.
My first argument is that students have a first amendment right that should be protected.
Although the courts have ruled a few times that students do not have first amendment rights in schools, we think, first, that this is a problematic decision, and second, it should not extend to the clothes that students wear when it is not destructive.
So, first on just the morality.
We think that this sort of policy is largely informed by archaic and largely unknown nuanced perceptions of how students engage.
We think that, in the modern day, as technology becomes more prevalent, as discourses regarding rights abuses become more common at a younger age, students are far more effective at being able to understand and express their rights.
As such, they are also able to engage politically far more easily.
Any individual who has voted in the last decade was affected at least somewhat by the news they read online and the comments that people put on them.
As such, we think that even young students, those in early high school, may have had some effect on the politics of either their classmates or of the people around them.
Restricting their ability to freely speak by restricting their ability to wear particular clothes is a, then, a violation of their first amendment rights.
It prevents them, first, from self-actualizing, as they cannot be happy with what they're wearing, but secondly, it restricts their political speech as well.
We think that the only time that restricting political speech is justified is when that political speech disrupts the school itself, but we think that other regulations can cover this.
Now my second argument is that this puts unfair standards on students.
Where do we see this?
First is with women in schools.
We think that these sort of policies usually force women to wear more clothes and have their clothes at a higher standard.
We think that, in the winter, it largely means that they still have to wear these sort of dresses, these tights, and as such, they're far more likely to be cold.
They're far more likely to be scrutinized and chastised based on the outfits they wear.
Conversely, we also think it harms men as well as, during the summer, men are still forced to wear khakis, can't change into shorts and as such, are uncomfortable.
We think that the comfort of students is worth far more than the egos of administrators who attempt to force a uniform on students of the school that they're controlling.
Secondly, though, we think that this is a bad policy for kids in poverty.
Why is this the case?
First, damaged clothes are harder to replace.
When I was a kid, if I were to ruin my pants, I could go to a goodwill or another thrift shop and buy new pants incredibly cheaply.
Were there a uniform and I had to buy it through the same sort of organization every time, my parents would be incredibly hard-pressed to actually fulfill this sort of obligation.
We think that's unfair to put particular harms on students, even if it's not written into the policy itself.
If the effect is classist, it should not be enforced.
Additionally, we think that things like dirty clothes, we think that inabilities to essentially get to the laundromat at a particular time, are far more likely to be punished for students in poverty, pushing them into worse classes, pushing them through more disciplinary action, and largely harming their efforts in the rest of their life.
For this reason, we should ban school uniforms."
"We should increase immigration to the united states.
So by this we mean that the US should increase the quota for immigrants.
Right now there is an overall quota of about six hundred thousand people per year who are allowed to immigrate to the US.
We think that that quota should be vastly increased to as many as two and a half million people, much much higher than it is today.
Secondly, through out our individual country quotas, which means that it's much easier to come to this country from bhutan than it is from china, because the quota is the same for every country.
We think those quotas should be abolished completely.
If we have two million people who want to come here from india we say let them.
So three reasons why the US should do this.
First, we tell you that immigration leads to economic growth.
It's simple math that when you bring people to this country and have them get to work, that your overall domestic product increases because you have more people producing.
But on top of that we tell you that the kind of people who are likely to give up their life in their home country and come to america are the sort of go getters who lead to economic growth.
There's a reason that so many businesses in america are founded by immigrants or by their children.
We tell you that ultimately these are people with drive and initiative who are very likely to take risks to start businesses, to work harder, to put in extra hours.
That ultimately these are the kind of people that we want in our country: hardworking people who will ultimately grow the economy by having a greater output of their work than what we would have otherwise.
We think it's silly to cap the amount of people who are allowed to come here when it means that we cap our own economic growth.
Our second argument is about the humanitarian reasons, why the US should do this.
Right now there are hundreds of thousands of syrians who need a place to live and the united states is a mostly empty country.
We tell you that it is inexcusable for america, which has bountiful land and enough money to settle these people, not to let them come here to live in safety.
We think that it's inexcusable to let people die around the world in wars partially caused by american intervention and then not let them move to this country.
In particular, for places like vietnam and iraq that have been devastated by US intervention, we think that we owe it to those people to let them start a new life here because we damaged their ability to carry out their old life there.
But aside from this, at the point where people have a right to live in freedom and safety, and at the point in which the US is mostly empty, particularly much of the west, we think that we should be bringing these people in, helping them get established, and that ultimately this would be beneficial for everyone.
Our third and final argument, and I think that this is critical for the debate, is that immigration is part of what makes america, america.
Almost everyone here has ancestors who immigrated voluntarily.
We think that in the past the US has been an international center of economic growth and innovation because of the strong tradition of immigration.
I told you about why immigrants are likely to work harder than other people because they're go getters by their very nature, but on top of that every new wave of immigration to the united states re-entrenches that culture of innovation.
If you think about who goes to elite universities in america today, many people would say there's lots of asian people, but that's driven by the fact that the most recent waves of immigration have largely been asian.
A hundred years ago, many people were resentful that there were so many jews in american universities, but that was partly driven by the fact that there was a large wave of jewish immigration.
We tell you that ultimately new waves of immigration will ensure that we have more people pushing their children to succeed in the way that immigrant families tend to do.
That their children will go to harvard, yale, stanford, wherever, and ultimately continue to ensure that the US is a center of innovation.
But aside from that immigrants also bring a unique perspective to the united states, a global perspective.
The idea that we should care about what happens around the world, that we shouldn't just isolate ourselves and let dictators or other horrible things go on unchallenged.
So ultimately we think that immigrants bring a huge amount to the united states that makes us who we are as a country.
For these reasons we think that we should increase immigration to the united states.
Thank you."
"We should abolish personality tests.
Pseudo-science has no role in government action however, many government agencies rely heavily on personality tests when conducting interviews whether it be of a potential job candidates or of prisoners of the state, that is individuals taken by the police.
When we use personality tests, we say that the world can be concretely and easily separated into generic blocks and that those blocks deserve differing punishment based on how we fill in a simple and ineffective test.
Because personality tests are so insidious and they must be stopped immediately, would support following the model that all government agencies stop using personality tests.
To briefly define personality tests we would say that these are based on an over arching personality, that they're based on the idea that there are certain roles that people can play based purely on the answers to these tests.
What we are excluding from this is things like cop personality tests where we ask whether or not you are fit to hold a gun, if you understand the implications of your action.
We think that testing whether someone has a particular understanding of their own actions and how it affects other people is probably a good thing to do, but when we're trying to use personality tests to suss out what they think is most important, we do very little service to the person doing the interview or the person trying to get the job.
Two arguments today.
First, on how these personality tests are ineffective and second, that it lends a false sense of legitimacy to problematic power structures.
It is essential to understand that personality tests have no scientific basis.
There's no way that you can place people in these sort of neat boxes.
Additionally, there's a market incentive for these personality tests to be useless.
This is because both personality tests are created in order to have some profound revelation at the end of it.
You can't simply say this is an average person with average goals and ideals because that would seem disingenuous to the interviewer or would it offend individuals as they seem not special.
As such, there's always an incentive for the creators of these tests to blow these things out of proportions.
They much like horoscopes.
If your horoscope said you're gonna have a boring day, you're gonna eat oatmeal and then go to your job, you would stop reading horoscopes.
In the same way, personally tests must have profound and interesting results simply because there's a market incentive to misinform the public.
Additionally, personality tests are based on the day in which the test is taken and the opinions of the person doing the test and providing the test.
What we mean by this is that people get different results on the different day that they take a test and as such, they're completely arbitrary.
Given this, there's no information that can be gleaned from these personality tests and as such, they ought be abolished.
At best, they are simply a fun party trick which has no role in government and at worse they are a racist and sexist institution created by powerful individuals in order to entrench their own goals and place in society.
Now my second argument is that they provide a false sense of legitimacy to problematic systems.
Recognize that these personality tests have major effects on people's lives.
They are use for things like parole where we decide if someone's fit to go back to society.
Rather than sending them to a therapist, many time parole boards do simple personality tests which largest say that this person ought be put back in prison unless they give generic form letter answers that say I'm a reformed individual who will not harm other people.
Additionally, it can affect the kind of therapy you get to whether it's an institution and you're institutionalized or simply working with a therapist.
Worse quality of care is a problem and as such, we should abolish personally tests in these cases.
Finally, it can affect your placement in school.
Sometimes personality tests are used at a young level in order to determine if someone deserves to be in advanced placement or not.
As such, we would say that all of the uses of personality tests are problematic and lead to individuals making incorrect decisions based on bad information.
As such, we should abolish personality tests."
"Science is a major threat.
So the important context for this debate is to understand that while people may think that scientific and human progress is a linear event, scientific progress has actually seen an exponential increase over recent centuries.
The amount of progress that humanity has achieved in the last fifty years is equal to the amount of progress that we achieved in the one thousand years prior to that.
Human expansion is occurring at dramatically increased rates, populations are rising and science is rising with it.
What this means is that we live in a status quo in which we are facing increasingly new scientific prospects, but we also dramatically lack the infrastructure to deal with new scientific the problems that may arise with scientific possibilities.
But it also means that these changes are occurring so quickly that we don't have the understanding of the harms that may come with it and how to solve those harms.
We think that this pace of science is what poses a major threat.
And we're going to talk about four ways in which science poses a threat tangibly.
The first is the rise of AI.
With the rise of artificial intelligence there's a possibility that this intelligence will have control over the internet and have control over our spheres of discourse as well as to be able to develop intelligence that exceeds our own.
With this type of possibility comes of course possibilities that have been conjectured in science fiction from for a century, but are real possibilities that AI could end up posing a threat to humanity.
That AI may choose to turn against humanity and that through turning against humanity could use its increased intelligence to be pose as an existential threat to humanity.
And while we may not know if this is a real possibility, if the science behind this would allow this to happen, if you posed or if you created an artificial intelligence that is able to be to be smarter than a human, to do more computation to really perceive or to really behave as if it was human as if it had consciousness, which is what scientists are trying to develop now, the possibility for for continued exponential growth that AI could be devastating.
The second tangible flaw or problem that we face is the potential of super bugs and different types of disease and dirty bombs and things like this.
So the reason that this is a problem is that with the increased use of medication, with the increased use of science, of pharmaceuticals and things like this, we've been able to develop better contagions and better types of dirty bombs and dirty devices and with this comes the possibility that terrorists and other organizations could have massive attacks in urban areas without having to explode a bomb, without having to use different types of weapons or things like this.
They could simply go into an area expose an area to a virus, a super virus and what this could do is it could wipe out an entire urban area in mere weeks.
Now while this seems like a far fetched threat, with the development and scientific progress in investigating disease, we've also developed incredibly powerful diseases, viruses to understand how they function.
If these things were to get loose, they could pose real existential threats to the world.
There's also the third thing we're going to talk about, is the the increased availability of private information.
What we mean by this is that science, through technology, has allowed us to be increasingly connected to storing information on these magical devices called computers in which we're able to store infinitely more information, have access to infinitely more information.
But the connectivity also makes us incredibly vulnerable.
While it was very difficult to break into my house and steal my financial records before, it's much easier to hack into my bank account and steal or my or my email address and steal my banking statements.
What this means is that with the pervasion of technology in this the synonymity of technology with our modern society it makes it much easier for private information to be stolen.
If private information can be stolen en masse, it can lead to massive problems for large corporations which which could have dramatic implications on our economic system and it can lead to things it can lead to different sorts of conflicts between states if sensitive information could get leaked, say, information for the united states being leaked, about plans to do things in russia or vice versa.
These things can have dramatic implications on how the world functions and those three tangible threats are just one of the many that show that science is a major threat."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should subsidize journalism.
What this would look like would be pouring government money into major specific scholarships that would put you on the right track to go into journalism, it would provide grants to journalism groups so that they can conduct more investigative research, it would go into making free new subscriptions and free sites about the news, especially investigative journalism-type news.
Maybe it would do things like create subscriptions for free for any kind of like college student, or maybe it's based on your economic status, anything like that.
And with that, two main areas of clash: first on increasing access to free information.
Recognize that news is fundamental to our relationship with the state and the government in that it is the only way in which people can get information about the government that allows them to make educated future decisions or relate to the government on a personal level, right?
Like we think that even if the government is the most democratic thing in the world, does everything by the book, it still doesn't matter, if the people underneath that regime do not know about their government and do not access do not have access to the information that will teach them about it.
So, we think that in addition to the fact that if I don't know what's going on in politics, because I don't have access to the news, I won't be able to vote well in in elections, there's another layer that just says, "" hey, if you're a democratic regime, you better be letting people know what the hell is going on behind closed doors. ""
We also think that access can be a really unique problem in these situations, given that a lot of people just don't have wifi, or the money for a new subscription, or a regular internet connection, things like like very simple things, and we think that especially with the phasing out of print media, it gets more and more difficult for people to access a good, like non-biased point of view on the news that will allow them to make informed decisions into the long term.
So we actually think that getting access to journals, to people who want to learn about more things in the world, is really positive, and if you were able to increase this awareness through subsidization, you would let people see journalism as a valid media and profession into the long term.
So, rather than what's happening now, where parents will actively discourage their children from going into majors like english or journalism because they feel like it's unstable, we think we're promoting a world in which because journalism is so much more popular, because you can read different journals for free, or maybe it's subsidized, you're much more likely to actually respect the category as a whole.
Our second area of clash is about promoting truth-seeking.
Because recognize that journalism actually serves a really important democratic check in that if you want to make sure that your government is being democratic, if you want to make sure there aren't any kind of corrupt backwards deals going on in alleyways, then the only way in which you can check that or promote that is if someone is going to write something about it.
Not everyone has the means by which they can go and investigate a journal on their own or figure out a hot button issue, rather they rely on the news and the media to do that for them.
And so we actually think that one of the ways in which the government provides clear oversight over themselves is by allowing journalism to exist and not limiting it in the way that we've often seen people try to do.
And there there have actually been a few problems recently where the government is unwilling to cooperate with the journal when it is trying to go in for a story, and so we actually think that if you give it enough money to subsidize those investigations, you're going to create a working open door between government and journalists, so you don't have to jump through as many hoops next time you want to get factual evidence or factual things about like a certain case that you're working on.
We also think that the government needs to show that it is willing to subject itself to more oversight.
This is very much a trust-building activity.
Like, in recent years, we've had things like the snowden scandal, like the NSA has been doing some really shitty things, and so the only way in which we think we can actively counter that is by allowing the government to be transparent enough from the beginning that people don't have to work really hard or leave the NSA in order to show that.
We also think that journalism generally teaches people to think critically, especially about the government, which is really good in terms of creating a dynamic democracy that can adjust and change as people's needs change.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should fight the BDS movement.
We mean by this is that generally we think that other countries, we don't think that you necessarily have to like name a specific one, should should not agree or support the BDS movement.
We would prefer a world in which it didn't exist.
Three main areas of clash, first on why it is morally unjust.
Recognize first in first foremost that with the BDS does is that it imposes the entire blame for the continued israeli occupation and settlement of israel on the israeli government rather than recognizing the fact that this is a multi dimensional problem that has been contributed to both by the palestinian authority and by the israeli government, in that they like specifically divest from israel and they don't say like: "" okay, maybe we should be actually working for peace between, like working towards a compromise. ""
Rather they say: "" no.
Israel needs to be the one that gives in and figures this out. ""
The problem is that israel has, numerous times, already given in an already given up.
Right?
We've had at least three times where israel has offered to end the occupation and palestine has refused every time, even when almost all of their demands are met.
And they have refused only on the grounds that they do not believe that israel has the right to exist at all, and that they want more land than what was given to them previously.
This is incredibly problematic because regardless of whether or not you disagree or agree with with with israel's actions, or with the two state solution, it is necessary in international conflicts to recognize that there are multiple groups at play and to recognize the culpability for a lack of a compromise on multiple groups.
It is unjust that we require all of the compromising and all of the action to come for israel, insofar as the only solution that the BDS would be happy to embrace is one in which israel did not exist at all.
Or the palestinian authority would be happy to embrace and therefore the BDS.
But moreover, it's also unjust in that it emboldens the palestinian authority to keep refusing until they get to the ideal deal, because they see that they have infinite support from western liberals.
And this is incredibly problematic not only because it edges on some of the things I'm going to say later about anti-semitism, but also because it means there's going to be continued violence and continued rejection of any deal on the part of the palestinian authority until israel gives in entirely.
This is bad because in the at the end of the day whether or not you think that israel should have been established in the first place, it has been established and it would be unjust to kick out the millions and millions of people that call it their home.
Our second area of clash is about the way in which the BDS is just a veil for anti-semitism.
Recognize that israel is the only democracy in the middle east.
It is the best in terms of its track record with human rights etcetera.
The arab members are treated the best even out of other arab nations in the area, in that they are allowed to serve in the government, to hold any jobs they like want to and have free anti-israeli political speech.
The problem when BDS uniquely targets them rather than any other country, is that it denies all of those successes and says that regardless of that we would prefer that you did not exist or existed in a much more diminished state.
But given that it only supports the palestinian authority above the above above israel, and we've already recognized the palestinian authority will not rest until israel doesn't exist, it ultimately does only support the end of israel entirely.
It also it also blatantly is anti-semitic in that it denies the horror of the holocaust and other jewish oppression by claiming that this homeland ought not be deserved in the first place.
It is one thing to think that the treatment of palestinians is bad.
It is another to say to support a group that says: "" you ought not exist at all. ""
Knowing that that is the ultimate goal.
Regardless of what the stated doctrine of the BDS is the fact that they act in ultimate support and unending support for a group that wants israel wiped off the map is just a way for a bunch of liberals to pretend that they're jew supporters on paper while actually being vastly anti-semitic in terms of their political actions.
Our third area of clash is about why economic sanctions are very bad.
They hurt innocent civilians but also they hurt those who benefit from israel.
So people can no longer get access to medication that israel exports, or new technology or new military tech, all suffer because of these kinds of sanctions.
Proud to propose."
"We should adopt multiculturalism.
So by that we mean that we think that the practice of having multiple cultures exist alongside each other in a pluralistic fashion in a country, is preferable to trying to seek to integrate everybody into one monolithic culture.
So we think that basically the comparison here is between the idea of a melting pot, where everyone blends together into one culture, and a salad, where all of the distinct components remain recognizable.
Three arguments: first, we thinks it ultimately multiculturalism leads to more immigrants coming to your country which makes your country more competitive economically.
We see, for instance, that people are more likely to immigrate to countries which are more tolerant.
This is why places like canada actually have a higher rate of immigration than the united states.
We think that when people feel that they can go to a new country and be more accepted for their culture, and not have to worry about integrating into the dominant culture, that they're more likely to choose to move to that country.
You know, imagine that you're a sikh doctor in india and you want to move to the west.
Would you choose to go to a country where you're going to have to give up your religion and your traditional practices in order to fit in, or a country where you can continue any of those practices that are important to you, or that you like, and you'll still be accepted?
We think it's obvious that you would pick the second one given the choice.
At that point we think that you're more likely to bring in immigrants and highly qualified workers from other countries.
Why is this such a boon?
One reason why countries like canada, the US and australia are so much wealthier than the rest of the world is that they have brain gain and other countries have brain drain.
Many of the best and brightest in countries like india or pakistan choose to leave those countries and come to the US, canada, australia.
We think that this makes the countries that receive these immigrants more competitive, because they have you know better doctors, better engineers, better professors, at the expense of every other country.
So all countries should seek to have this big draw factor for immigrants in order to increase their own economic competition on a global scale.
Or competitiveness I should say.
Our second argument is about promoting tolerance.
We think that when there is a norm that everyone has to assimilate to your culture when they moved to your country, that this makes it easier for people to be intolerant.
If they see someone who's a little bit different, or who's sticking out, then they think that person needs to change to become more like me.
That's the melting pot model.
But when people experience multiculturalism, we think it's more likely that they're willing to accept others for who they are, to tolerate small differences and to try to learn to empathize with other people.
A huge driver of racism and religious discrimination and things like that is the empathy gap between people of different backgrounds.
But we think that if you live with the idea that it's okay for people to be different, then it's easier to bridge that empathy gap, versus if you live in a country where it's not acceptable for people to be outside of the mainstream culture.
Our third and final argument is that we think that a better national culture emerges as a result of multiculturalism.
Because recognize that if you have one culture that everyone has to assimilate to then ultimately you're going to have a harmful norms internalized into that mainstream culture.
People who immigrated in previous waves of immigration are likely to look down on current immigrants for instance.
We see this in america.
Many people who are third generation americans look down on people who are first generation americans even though their grandparents or great grandparents work from this country, and that's because they think: "" look, we italians or germans or whoever integrated.
Why can't people from latin america do it in the same way? ""
We think that when you have multiculturalism you end up with a national culture that's more focused on tolerance and accepting others, that's more willing to adopt things that are good from the immigrant cultures, and more willing to engage in self criticism about what is bad in the existing culture.
So for these reasons we should adopt multiculturalism.
Thank you."
"We should legalize the growing of the coca leaf.
So just to be clear what this debate is about, we're not saying that countries should legalize cocaine.
What we're saying is that the coca plant ought be legal in the countries where it grows naturally, places like libya, peru and colombia, where historically the native americans chewed the leaf as a stimulant for thousands of years and where many working people today still chew the leaf for a mild stimulant effect, which is nothing at all like cocaine and is not super-addictive, and it doesn't have the same health effects that cocaine does.
So with this in mind, three arguments for why we should legalize the growing of the coca leaf.
The first is that we think that this would actually undercut the illegal drug trade.
We think that if the coca leaf were available as an alternative for people to use that there would be less incentive for people living in latin america to consume cocaine.
We think that, in general, when you ban other substances, you make the worst possible substances more popular.
Why is this true?
Given that people face similar legal repercussions for using coca leaf as for using cocaine, and given that cocaine has much more extreme pleasurable effects, we think that in the status quo there's no incentive for people to use the less addictive, less harmful coca leaf.
By legalizing the drug we think that, ultimately, we make it more likely that people will choose to cultivate coca leaves for use in this particular non-addictive fashion rather than for use in cocaine.
This will obviously undercut the drug cartels in as much as it harms their ability to get access to coca leaves.
Now the other team might tell you that the cartels force people to grow coca leaves for them, in the status quo.
But we think that in our world, it is much more likely that the production of coca leaves will be normalized and regulated in such a way that the drug cartels will have greater difficulty doing this to begin with.
In other words, you undercut them because the production of the plant is no longer something that they have a monopoly on.
Our second argument is that we think that banning the coca leaf is an infringement on the rights of the native peoples of the andean region.
We see that these people have used coca leaves as a mild drug for thousands of years, similar to the cultural role that coffee has in places like ethiopia and turkey or that alcohol has in places like britain or germany.
We think that, ultimately, the reason why coca leaf is illegal, but tobacco or alcohol are legal, is an imposition of the colonial governments in this region.
When the spaniards first came here, they saw people using an unfamiliar drug and decided that it must be immoral, because they associated it with the way of life of the native americans.
We think that because these people have been oppressed for centuries, it is critical that we allow them to maintain their cultural institutions and allow them to flourish.
The only way to undo past wrongs, in terms of cultural oppression, is to encourage cultural tolerance now.
The harms of the past cannot be undone, only mitigated, and we think that we do this best by legalizing the growing of the coca leaf, particularly since this law disproportionately punishes native people, while not punishing the white settlers who go on to take advantage of the cocaine in the same way.
The last point that we would like to make is that there are many practical uses of the coca leaf that are being ignored in the status quo.
For instance, we tell you that there are likely many alkaloid chemicals within the coca leaf which have medical applications.
Recognize that this is why cocaine was first created is as a medication to be used in surgery and things like that, created from the coca plant.
But due to prohibition, we see that very little research has been done into the use of the coca leaf.
In our world we think that, ultimately, it would be better to let scientists choose to study this plant and its potential uses rather than to ban it.
So because of the harms this would do to the drug cartels, in order to preserve native culture, and because of potential research uses of the coca leaf, we should legalize the growing of these coca leaves.
Thank you."
"All women short lists bring more good than harm.
The problem that we want to address in this debate is that women are grossly underrepresented in parliaments around the world.
We think that the best way to solve this is with some sort of affirmative action that would increase the number of women elected to parliament, even if voters or parties are not willing to do this on their own.
And when we say bring more good than harm we think that there are certainly benefits and negatives to this policy but that the good ultimately outweighs the bad.
So what we're going to advocate for is a policy in which parties such as the the tories and labour in britain are required to list a certain number of women on their list and then when they receive votes, that they would be required to put a certain number of women into office.
So, two main arguments: the first is that we think that this would lead to more female leaders throughout society.
Why is this true?
We think that it is the case that business and academia and other institutions are likely to implement similar policies if they're implemented at this government level.
We think it's likely, in other words, that this affirmative action will trickle down.
Why is this important?
We think that women are systematically excluded from positions of power, not only in government but throughout society.
We see that in government, political parties tend to run token female candidates at any given time rather than a significant number of them in order to appear progressive rather than actually walk the walk as it were.
And we think that this only gets worse as you move further down in society.
Governments are subject to a certain amount of scrutiny in a way that private business oftentimes is not.
So we think that private business in particular is likely to discriminate against women and not to offer them very many opportunities.
What we do, on our side of the house, is first of all create a government which is full of women who will then eventually leave government and go on to fill positions throughout society.
But on top of that we tell you that these women are likely to appoint female officials to other positions and that it's likely that those officials will later hire other women etcetera and that this will trickle down through all layers of government and eventually when some of those people go to work in private business they will take these policies with them.
We think that the good of this greatly outweighs the harm of having perhaps women who might not always have been appointed if they were men, because at the end of the day if more women are being put into office then there will be better training available for women and more opportunities for them in education and in the workplace which will eventually lead us to a point where we don't need this affirmative action anymore.
Our second argument is that we think that governments that were close to fifty percent women would have better policies.
We think that old men are uniquely ill suited to govern when it comes to things like women's health or the needs of families.
We think that it's important that you have a broad swath of society represented in parliament to that right now the simply isn't the case.
If this were implemented, we think that for instance you might have more common sense resolutions that would improve health for women, you might see better sex education provided for young people, and you'd probably see more opportunities for families in need and things like that.
We could certainly see that a country like rwanda, which has a uniquely high proportion of women in parliament, has better policies then it's male dominated neighbors in terms of female reproductive health.
Things like banning genital mutilation etcetera have all been done at a much greater rate in rwanda then by their neighbors.
We also think that in terms of debate, that a variety of perspectives is necessary to reach the best outcome and when women's perspectives are absent from parliament you're likely to have inferior quality of debate.
If the best ideas emerge only from competition then the competition is stunted and so was the best idea that can emerge from it when women are excluded.
So for these reasons we think that all women shortlist bring more good than harm.
Thank you."
"Science is a major threat.
So in this debate the question is not is science good or bad only does it pose a threat to human existence?
We think that by major threat we mean some sort of threat that would pose a risk to millions or billions of people.
So with that in mind we have three arguments for you.
The first is that the ability to develop new technology or apply technology in new ways advances more quickly than ethics.
I think an example will be helpful here.
Consider genetic engineering, it is very likely that in the next decade or so we will be able to make designer babies for people.
You'll be able to go to the hospital and say I want a baby with green eyes and brown hair who is going to be five foot ten when he grows up or when he'll be a boy and all of these other things.
But we don't know yet if this is an ethical thing to do.
Society lags behind.
Our ethical systems are based on an older level of technology.
So questions like is it acceptable to choose traits about your children that in the past would have been left up to chance, that will determine their success in life, or different aspects of how they interact with others.
We also haven't really had time to consider whether it's right or wrong for people to play god in this way and I think that ultimately ethics always has to play catch-up to science.
The technology advances at a very quick rate and ethicists, and philosophers, and religious leaders, ultimately have to come to terms with things that they don't fully understand after they're able to see the consequences.
This poses a major threat to society in terms of our collective ethics, how we treat one another, and if you are obligations to other people.
So I think that the risk of societal upheaval is clearly a major threat.
Our second argument is about the existence of existential threats.
If you think about the kind of problems that might kill everyone in the world, global warming, nuclear war, some sort of rogue virus or something, none of these things exist in nature.
Back you know a hundred thousand years ago when everybody lived on the plains of africa nobody had to worry about climate change.
That was true up really until the last three hundred years.
That human beings weren't really powerful enough to make a long term impact on the planet.
But what we've seen in the last hundred years or so, is that the development of nuclear weapons, the acceleration of carbon emissions, means that suddenly we are making decisions about the world that will affect the future, not just for the next twenty or thirty years but for the next million years.
Ultimately, the use of a nuclear weapon might mean that a city is uninhabitable for a million years.
I think, I don't fully understand the implications.
I don't think many people do.
Climate change might mean that no one can ever live in new york city again come a few hundred years.
So ultimately science is a major threat because it has given us the ability to do much more harm than we ever had in the past.
This isn't to say that we don't get good things from science, only that the amount of damage people are able to do is much greater than it would have been back before the scientific revolution in the early modern period.
And our last argument is that science is unpredictable.
It used to be that the world changed very slowly.
If you were an ancient roman, say, you didn't have the perception that technology was that much different in your lifetime then your grandfather's lifetime or his grandfather's lifetime even.
But nowadays technology changes so quickly that even within the course of a single lifetime, people can't recognize the world around them.
We think that science is a major threat because it's unpredictable what the outcomes of scientific advances will be.
You know if you had asked your grandmother in nineteen thirty what she thought the year two thousand would look like, it probably wouldn't be very much like the real thing because technology has changed so much so quickly.
We think in the same way that it's difficult for people to plan for the future now because we don't know what it will look like.
So ultimately for these three reasons, we think that science is a major threat.
Thank you."
"Nationalism does more harm than good.
What's important to recognize about nationalism right at the outset is that it doesn't arise from anything natural about the peoples that express nationalist attitudes.
There's nothing about german nationalists or french nationalists or chinese nationalists that makes those types of groups uniquely combined to each other and in fact most of these groups grew out of a very distinct cultural subsections prior to the eighteenth century.
For example in germany there was no german state prior to the eighteenth century.
It was a conglomeration of many different german and frankish kingdoms that came together to form a modern state, and the modern state is about when these attitudes eventually arose within our society.
So it's important to recognize that there's nothing fundamentally human about nationalism, there's nothing that combines these populations in any unique way.
Between the fact that they neighbor each other and in some instances share cultural bonds though when you allow for nationalism and when nationalism arises in the way that it has in the last two centuries, it allows for new different cultural bonds to be formed which are frankly exclusive in many ways and most importantly arbitrary in their creation.
They're simply made in order to enforce this idea of national identity and national community that doesn't exist and is often a tool of those empowered by nationalism to use that nationalism as a guise for fascism.
But firstly, before I get on to that I think it's important to talk about why nationalism is simply a bad political force within the world.
Nationalism by its definition is exclusionary.
In order to celebrate a nation you must create distinctions between that nation and those around it and while some would argue for a cosmopolitan nationalism that allows for people to celebrate their nation simply because it's something that is diverse and beautiful, such as the united states and the idea of the melting pot, firstly, this isn't how nationalism actually arises in the world.
Nationalism is more often in more often the case, nationalism is the force that says: my national identity group, my my ethnicity, my regional nation, any sort of group is is better than other groups that border me, or that there's something that makes them distinct that makes them superior.
This false superiority creates a a sense of xenophobia throughout the world, which is one reason why there's, in the, in europe right now there's such a hesitancy to to accept refugees from syria, and from other war torn areas in the middle east and northern and northern africa.
This is because there's this idea that there's some sort of benefits that we read from our nation that are exclusive the benefits for our nation.
That because we are where we are we have earned the goods and resources that we get from these regions.
But we only get these benefits because of the arbitrary nature of where we were born and what our region happens to have and what it can give us.
There's no one more deserving of getting these sort of political goods whether it be a stable government or representative democracy than people that are fleeing to these areas as refugees.
It's just the luck of where they were born.
Given that this is the case we think that nationalism becomes an exclusionary political philosophy that only harms the most disenfranchised people like refugees, who are not able to access the goods that they desperately need.
We also think that it creates divisions within a society itself.
It means that people that have become part of this communities, say minority groups in in largely white european countries, feel excluded from their own society.
Whether it's through ideas of nationalism that simply don't create an image of the nation that includes them, or it's more overt and direct threats.
That come from largely far right groups that use nationalism as a guise for fascism.
And this the other problem with nationalism.
It's that when you create xenophobic senses within a state that creates this sort of false superiority that my nation is better than your nation, it allows for strong man leaders to stand up and say: I'm going to protect the nation.
I'm going to ensure the nation rises to its former glory, and these sort of robust senses of pride in the nation allow for these people to get away with crimes and other sorts of corruption that allow them to enrich themselves while at the same time creating strong men groups that create serious threats to democracy not just in developed but also in not just in developing nations but also developed nations such as greece where the xri'si party is rising, and france with marine la pen, in england with braxit and with united states and donald trump.
All of these people use nationalism as a way to try and fuel their political anger that their people feel and it only creates more divisions within our society which is frankly contradictory to the global ideas that have been set forth for the past for the past sixty or seventy years of post world war two, peace and prosperity that's occurred.
For these reasons we think that nationalism has certainly done more harm than good."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should further exploit green technology.
What we mean by this is that we would preferably have something like government subsidies for corporations that are exploring green technology or corporations that are trying to adopt green technology.
Presumably government buildings and government branches would adopt green technology, and you'd have generally like a larger acceptance in society.
You'd probably place more taxes on things that run on oil or don't use greener tech.
Three main areas of clash: the first on the environment.
We think that this is actually the most important thing in the round because people currently are dying and suffering from global warming and global energy increase.
Like even in the status quo, we're seeing that the oceans are slowly being pushed up the coastlines, storms are being created that destroy entire cities.
We think that the hurricane in texas is actually a really good example of a country of a state that hadn't really been impacted for a long time by storms of this size, but because of global warming, it's actually causing crises even in areas that hadn't previously been affected.
Meanwhile, areas like madagascar, areas like island countries, are suffering much more because their entire like borders are coasts, and so they're actually in a lot more danger and are suffering much more.
And so we think that actually preventing this suffering is the most important thing, given that it is so widespread and so immediate.
So, the way in which green technology protects the environment is by making cleaner energy.
Even if you're just adding green technology on to something that burns oil, you're making it so that the emissions coming from it are no longer as bad.
But green technology also encompasses doing things like creating green cars and making it so that your cars aren't emitting as much, and it prevents those kind of rollover effects in which suddenly you have smog hanging over the cities or like things like that.
So, our second area of clash is about economics, because oil is incredibly expensive.
But more important than that, it's foreign, which means that you're tied to other countries and those countries' mood swings in order to provide energy for your entire population.
We think really good example of a time where this really bit us in the butt is in nineteen seventy three when the middle east was unhappy with the way that we were treating israel and said, "" hey, we don't like that.
And since you're not like changing how you're treating them, we're just not going to sell you oil for a little bit. ""
We think moments like those really show us why the need for more green technology is is like so important because, in the end, being dependent on other countries means that it is just up to their preferences whether to completely destroy our productivity for like the foreseeable future.
Like if the middle east decided to stop selling us oil at this moment, completely, it would be very difficult for us to continue functioning as a country, and we don't think this is something that is tenable in the long term.
Meanwhile, green technology is actually preferable economically.
First, recognize that oil is running out, so even if the mood swings aren't happening, you are having a decrease in supply, which means an increase in price.
But when you have green technology, you're stimulating innovation, and you're making it something that humans can build.
So this is something that is an economic impetus, and you're actually creating corporations within the united states that can like trade with each other and create jobs.
But most importantly, you're attaining energy independence.
That means that your state can function without depending on others for technology or for the actual oil.
Our third area of clash is about how this is a response to population growth.
Lots of people are populating the earth right now.
We know that population growth is a pretty big problem, and this billions and billions of people need more energy than we currently are producing.
Like, we know that we're running out of energy right now and we're running out of oil, and so we think that green technology actually solves for this really well and is actually the only option that we have if we don't want to destroy the planet and ourselves.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should adopt to vegetarianism.
So, this is a debate saying that individual people have an obligation to become vegetarians, to swear off eating meat, and other animal products.
So with that in mind, we have two main arguments for you: the first is about the rights of animals.
We're going to tell you that, animals are worthy of moral consideration, and that it is unethical to eat them for this reason.
Recognize that, any moral distinction between animals and humans will always be arbitrary.
Many people might say that humans deserve more consideration than animals, because they're more intelligent, but this clearly isn't always true.
We see that, an adult dolphin, for instance, is much more able than a baby human to make certain decisions.
The other side might retort that, no one eats dolphins, but the point is that we do eat animals that are very intelligent, like octopus, and that on top of that, all animals clearly would prefer not to be in pain, rather than to be in pain.
We think that, this is indicative of some level of intelligence, and that we ought to respect these wishes.
In the same way that we don't force people to do things, that make them uncomfortable whenever possible, we view those as moral harms, we ought not force animals to do these things.
And recognize that, it's not just the act of eating the animal that causes so much suffering.
We think that, you know oftentimes it's possible to kill an animal painlessly, so they don't understand what's going on.
But the industry that supports the creation of meat, for our consumption, is deeply unethical.
We see that, you have chickens who were born into tiny cages, that are barely larger than they are, and then kept in dark buildings for their entire lives.
They grow so fat, that they can't walk around, and that are pumped full of chemicals, which prevent them from developing in a normal way.
We think that, it's extremely troubling that society is completely willing to overlook the horrifying, frankly, treatment of animals in the meat industry, in order to continue to satisfy a basic human instinct to eat meat.
We think that, people have an obligation to overcome these baser instincts, in order to respect the moral considerations of others, even if those others have hooves or feathers.
So because animals are deserving of moral consideration, because they're living things with preferences, we should become vegetarians, rather than continue to exploit them.
Our second argument, even if you don't care about animals, is about the environment, and I think it's clear that if you care about human beings as moral actors, that you'll care about this.
Realize that, the production of meat is tremendously resource intensive.
If you imagine a big pyramid, and let's say that there's a million calories worth of corn at the bottom of the pyramid, so, corn plants produce a million calories worth of food.
Every time you go up a level of the food chain, ninety percent of those calories are lost.
So, we go from a million levels at the bottom, to a hundred thousand calories, at the next level, at the cow level, to ten thousand calories at the human level.
That's all humans are receiving is ten thousand, because ninety percent of the calories are lost at every level, because digestion is inefficient, and because animals and plants consume a certain amount of calories as you move up the food chain.
So what we see is that, whereas you could feed ten times as many people, with an acre of land producing corn for human consumption, you feed only one tenth as many, if an acre of land is devoted to corn for cattle's consumption.
So ultimately, we think that in a world where people are starving, in a world where too much land is devoted to agriculture, and it's destroying our environment, that it is deeply unethical for posterity, and for people starving right now, to eat meat.
But, we also see that the environmental degradation, caused by the monoculture of corn and crops used to feed the livestock, is deeply devastating for the environment, and is causing irreversible damage, which means that future people, who we think deserve equal consideration with current people, are going to live in a worse environment, so that we can eat chicken nuggets.
For these reasons, we should adopt vegetarianism.
Thank you."
"I'm proud to support the motion that we should ban primary elections.
Three independent points, first is that these elections allow for more elite control over political systems.
What I mean by this is that in the status quo, we see a significant amount of elite influence.
So for example, established higher members of a party or like wealthy donors that sort of thing have a lot of control over the political process.
Who makes it to the ballot even at that really fundamental level is often controlled by just how much money wealthy people are willing to donate to them or how much support they get internally from within their party.
We think that while this influence is going to exist at pretty much every level because of how systemic it is, it is significantly worse with primary elections.
The reason for this is twofold.
First, a primary election, like say the democratic primary election or the republican primary election or whatever, is going to be much more controlled by that group of people because you have distilled the population of people that actually invest themselves into these elections down to that base.
So if you are concerned then about elites within the republican party making decisions about who the republican nominee will be, the primary is going to be an even more concentrated subset of individuals that will still entirely include republican party elites.
But secondly we think that there are problematic way for elites to get control and specifically a better avenue because of the low turnout.
When there is lower turnout at primary elections as there often is because there's less coverage because there's less discussion because it's seen as less high stakes elites can more easily control with things like donations because you're talking about less of a concerted opposition base of say poorer individuals within the party that could actually provide some sort of meaningful opposition to them.
Our second independent point though is that these these primary elections create artificial constraints on the voting population.
Specifically what we mean is that the primary election says okay we're going to take this field of say you know five candidates, whittle it down to one, and that's who we're going to put in the general election.
The problem is that this really really really alienates moderates who could feasibly vote for either party.
So say the democratic party is going to put through somebody and they decide amongst democratic voters, that is members of the party, they're gonna put someone that's pretty far to the left.
The problem then that when you get on to the general election is if the republican party also did that that is they also put someone who is fairly extreme in this case pretty far to the right moderates are left in the center with no real choice.
We think this is a problem because a lot of people in most countries are independents, people that don't see themselves as wedded to an individual political party and would like to see themselves participating in the process more directly but are stuck out of it because they would have to register with the party in order to vote in a primary election.
As a result of this then as a result of that alienation we think that moderates, independents, the large majority of people within most countries, are pushed out of the political process and are forced to then vote for the lesser of two evils when in reality a lot of people would be able to get behind a more centrist candidate.
Our third and final independent point though is that these elections have really low turn out and as a result in a lot of places extremely important decisions are made without the consent of the majority.
Take a state in the united states for example that consistently votes to one side or the other, say alabama.
Alabama does party based primaries so they have a republican primary and a democratic primary.
The problem is that because alabama is so firmly red the democratic primary doesn't matter.
Whoever wins that primary isn't going to win in the general.
Functionally, the republican primary is the election because the republican is going to win in such a like a uniformly conservative state but because these primaries have such lower turnout that means that you have a very small portion of the electorate participating in a very fundamental and important decision about who's going to get through, about who's going to be the next candidate.
As a result then we think that it is better to just have all the republicans in the general election to ensure the turnout is higher and that the governed are providing the most consent possible.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should raise the retirement age.
Currently it is around sixty five we're talking about the united states so we would probably raise it to about seventy to seventy five years old, but I think the debate is more broadly about whether or not this is a good idea.
Two main areas of clash, first about accommodating the age range shift.
Recognize that two things have occurred, first that people are becoming adults later.
They're leaving the house and their family a lot later, they don't oftentimes people don't exit college till their early to mid twenties and even then they often live at their parents' for a little bit longer than that.
It used to be that individuals would start to leave the house at like eighteen as soon as high school ended like they would start working right away and they would get married right away.
But in a society that has started more and more to value college education and to have less and less jobs that someone can acquire and live off of right after high school, it has like caused individuals to have the average age that is much higher for becoming financially independent of their parents.
This has become from like eighteen to like twenty one to twenty four-ish.
This means that people are getting their jobs and becoming contributors contributors to society a lot later.
The second component is that people are dying a lot later.
The average age of death used to be around sixty to seventy five, but now it's a lot closer to eighty to ninety.
It means that people have to live on retirement benefits for a lot longer if the window has shifted it makes sense that the retirement should age should accommodate that in order to reflect the needs of individuals and society.
We think that the problem is that when you have a retirement age that is lower than the general population, you're not actually accommodating what that society needs or making sure that people are properly taken care of.
We think it's important that the that like the legislature reflects what actually happens within society which it doesn't in the status quo.
But our second area of clash is about maximizing social productivity.
I think first we need to talk about avoiding the social security network crash.
The social security system is already overloaded and it gets a lot worse when people live on it for longer because they retired earlier but lived also for longer.
Like these systems just weren't created to keep people going for more than like five years than the expected age at which they should die was a lot earlier.
So what happens is that regardless of how much someone contributed into that system and regardless of how long it occurred for and regardless of whether or not they can keep working, they're able to collect social security benefits which necessarily takes it away from the generation after.
It means that the money takes away from these consecutive generations and they're stuck with a mass once they hit retirement age and they actually have to work for longer not by choice and not by legislature but rather because they have no fiscal ability to stay stable otherwise.
A lot of people are also forced into retirement early by this age.
We think that individuals have a right to keep working if that is what the preferr to do and what happens in the status quo is that a lot of industries will instantly push out individuals who happen to be of retirement age just because they can and can have replacement.
We think that a lot of stigma exists around someone being older in a certain field that is incredibly unfair and oftentimes especially in like companies that want to appear young and hip people get pushed out even if they're fully capable of meeting their responsibilities and the age and like the retirement age is used as an excuse.
We think first that we need to like we need to confront this ageism on face but also that we think that a lot of the time it's a lot more fiscally rewarding to keep working, like a lot of people leave sectors that are going to pay them a lot more than social security benefits would and I think that it should be up to them to make that calculus.
But also I think general productivity also gets affected.
We think we prefer for people to be contributing to society as long as possible.
Every person retired when they could be contributing is a net loss to society.
Old people often suffer from loneliness and what happens when you retire when you would prefer not to or before you like should is that you spend a lot more time being alone and like suffer from the epidemic that we see a lot with old people where they don't actually get like the attention they want and they are at much higher risk for healthcare problems than people of their age who are still working and like happy.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"We should legalize prostitution.
So, our side of the house we're saying that in countries where prostitution is illegal right now, such as the united states, it should be decriminalized.
We're fine with regulating it.
In the netherlands for instance prostitution is legal but brothels are very closely regulated by the state and there's no pimps.
We think that that would be a particularly good model for countries to follow.
Three big arguments for why we should legalize prostitution: the first is about personal freedom.
We think that in general government should defer to allowing people to do what they want.
Realize that in the state of nature, if there were no government, then people would be perfectly free to go into prostitution or any other line of work.
We think that in general government should strive to allow people to do what they will, particularly given that there are no real harms to others from this behavior.
Let's consider a few examples of when the state should intervene to limit personal freedom.
The first would be if there was a lack of information.
But we think that most people full well understand what it means to be a prostitute, particularly in a well regulated environment.
On top of that we think that the state could provide people with information rather than simply ban the activity, and that that would be less restrictive of personal freedom.
Giving out pamphlets, things like that, making people read and sign an agreement before becoming a prostitute.
We think that there are lots of ways that we can ensure that people weren't misled or taken advantage of.
And since, under the best sorts of models, people would be working for themselves, they would be free to stop being a prostitute if they decided that they didn't like it.
It's not like we're locking them in for a ten year contract.
The other time when we would want to limit personal freedom is when there are harms to third parties but we think that prostitution is fundamentally a victimless crime.
Recognize that, you know, that john isn't hurting anybody they're entering into a business agreement freely since there's no pimps on our model, and that the prostitute obviously isn't being harmed by this.
They can take precautions to avoid the spread of STD's, we could require that people wear condoms, things like that.
So we see that there's no good reason for the state to intervene here.
We think that the reason why prostitution is illegal right now is because some people think that it's unethical.
But the business of government is not to enforce ethics on others, it's to protect people from one another and given that no one is being harmed by prostitution, even if it means that some people think you won't go to heaven, we don't think that it should be the government's business to step in and prevent people from doing something for that reason alone.
With that in mind, our second main argument is that we think that the black market is worse than regulated legalization.
Because realize that as long as there's a demand for prostitutes, there's always going to be prostitution.
Even if it's illegal.
So what does it look like?
First of all, if prostitution is illegal, then it means that if somebody harms a prostitute then the prostitutes can't go to the police.
For instance if someone were to sexually assault a prostitute, they wouldn't feel comfortable going to the police even though they obviously need help, because they would be afraid of being arrested or of putting their business in jeopardy as a result of cooperating with the police.
So we think that you would see lower rates of sexual assault if you were to legalize prostitution.
But on top of that, organized crime often steps in to set up prostitution, given that it's illegal, because they're the ones who can move people from where there's a supply of people willing to be prostitutes, or even people who are unwilling whom they could human traffic and force to become prostitutes, to places where there is demand.
So we think that these organized crimes are criminals are responsible for a lot of human trafficking and pressuring people into becoming prostitutes.
We think that if you legalize the industry, that legitimate businesses would replace organized criminals, there would be less human trafficking because you could monitor the industry better and prevent it from happening.
So ultimately these would be great benefits to society.
So, in order to maximize personal freedom and to stop the black market we should legalize prostitution thank you."
"We should further exploit geothermal energy.
What we mean by this is that we think it would be good if the government encouraged its adoption.
We're fine with this coming in a monetary way, but generally this is a just a debate about whether or not we prefer a world in which we use more.
Two main areas of clash: first, on climate change.
I've established this over and over again: global warming is bad.
It leads to the destruction of coastline like populated villages and towns.
It like leads to the spread of diseases as climates that were previously inhospitable to specific strains become more hospitable and vice versa.
The destruction of crops and crop cycles occurs when some places become so much hotter or so much colder that it can no longer grow the same crops that it used to, which disrupts economic cycles in the way that human beings live their lives.
It kills people and animals, it causes droughts, the list of impacts is endless.
And the cause of all of this is the release of greenhouse gases as a by-product of the burning of oil, gas, and other kinds of energy.
These things go out into the atmosphere, they interact with the ozone layer, and it leads to a global energy increase, in fact, that causes severe climate change in both directions of extremes, cold and hot.
So this this like happens with everything, whether we're like heating houses or running companies or driving cars.
And recognize that like the solution to this is about changing the way in which we derive our energy.
So if we stop using oil and gas, if we replace it with something that, like, geothermal energy, that is significantly cleaner, then we are able to cut down the amount of greenhouse gases that are let into the environment, and we are able to come up with solutions for them.
So, we think that like if you can replace oil and gas-powered machinery with geothermal energy, you end up with much less pollution, which means less global warming, but it also means less air pollution, which we think becomes incredibly important when people live in cities that are very densely populated.
Like we've all seen photos of the smog that hangs over cities in china and japan and even los angeles, and this is really bad for the people who live there.
We see increased rates of asthma, we see increased rates of specific types of cancers, and so we think like the problem that happens on their side of the house is that they're not ever able to diversify their energy for like fundamental, like what provides that energy, so they're not actually able to fix the impacts.
And so we think that when you get cleaner air on our side of the house, that is also good.
Our second area of clash is about why it's better for the population.
Recognize, first and foremost, that it is renewable.
This means that it is naturally replenished and there's no way for us to exhaust energy when it is properly managed.
We also think that like the sheer amount that we are able to access is estimated to be absurd, like something like two terawatts worldwide.
This is a lot of potential, like enough to fuel the globe.
It's also just a lot cheaper to provide to larger groups of people.
First, it is a lot more available.
We see with gas and oil that countries that have pockets of it are infinitely more likely to get economic benefit from it.
They're able to restrict it from other countries that might need it.
And so we think that like renewability also lowers the market price as well as availability, so it's just cheaper.
But also, because you don't need any specific machinery to harness it, there's less cost fluctuations and like stable electricity prices, which is also really important when we're considering day-to-day operations of the average family.
So you're just not likely to get a situation in which suddenly saudi arabia decides they really hate you, so nobody can drive cars for like the next four million years.
We also think that it's just specifically very good for the kinds of common-day activities that like and the average person could benefit from.
It's really specifically good for heating and cooling systems, so it would be used for smaller households as well of large corporations.
This benefits the average consumer, and it's much more available worldwide than any kind of other source of energy, including sunlight or wind energy.
Proud to propose."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should ban corporal punishment.
Three independent points: first is that corporal punishment is abusive and creates harm.
This harm is manifest in two particular ways.
First is the physical harm, you know, that's intrinsic to corporal punishment, something like, you know, being physically assaulted is obviously, you know, harmful.
It hurts.
That's the point.
But secondly, there's psychological harm intrinsic to it that when someone undergoes repeated or even individual acts of corporal punishment, it often scars them permanently.
This is because it represents a broken sense of trust between the child and someone that is supposed to be their caretaker, that when their parent, someone that is specifically supposed to be protecting their safety and looking out for them, becomes an abuser, becomes someone that is hurting them and damaging them and breaking that trust, there is a break of sense then with the child, who needs structure in their life and needs protecting and their capacity to feel that they are being protected by anyone.
This is an issue and can often manifest itself in ways that stretch long beyond childhood, with trust issues, lack of willingness to, you know, associate with senses of authority and many other problems.
Given that this is a lot of harm that's pretty intrinsic to corporal punishment, the government should obviously do its part to reduce net suffering for people that live under the reign of that government, and as such you should ban corporal punishment.
Our second independent point is that children cannot consent meaningfully into corporal punishment.
Generally, when we talk about things that are harmful, the question about whether or not we should institute a ban is basically whether or not that harm is so significant that there's no way that the government could feasibly allow people to just consent into that harm based on, you know, just the ability to consent into harm generally through, you know, arguments that are mostly contention upon autonomy.
The problem though is that children just can't consent into this type of harm.
It's not a decision made by them.
They're being abused by an other person, so the only argument then that can be made on autonomy is whether or not, you know, it's just the parents' right to decide how to parent.
I think the problem here, though, is that there is a significant amount of , you know, variability that you'd be giving to abusers then if you were to make the decision based on, you know, just saying this is the parents' right to choose.
Because the reality is that there are just genuinely abusive parents, even if you think there is some sort of line in the sand where this is a legitimate parenting tactic.
Given that, I think that if you don't have a mechanism for cracking down on that abuse, you'll never get around to actually helping the kids who are just genuinely suffering at the hands of parents or caretakers who are not acting in their best interests.
This isn't something children agree to so we shouldn't make them beholden to the consequences of these actions.
Our third independent point is that a ban normalizes reporting.
So, I think in a lot of places where corporal punishment isn't already illegal, there's kind of this general standard that a lot of people who are potential witnesses to corporal punishment just don't say much of anything, because they think of it as a private affair.
This is often then reinforced by the fact that the government doesn't actually see this as, you know, something that should be illegal and as such, this isn't even when it is really serious abuse that would go beyond what we consider to be corporal punishment, it's not reported because people think of it as a private affair.
When the government though puts a ban on corporal punishment, I think that normalizes the idea that this is a problem, that this is something that you should bring to the attention of the like to child protection services or whatever.
Because this is something that there is a serious likelihood of abuse, when you have that ban, you signal that this is a problem and that this is something people should speak up about.
And that goes a long ways in ensuring that children don't have to suffer at the hands of abusers.
Proud to propose."
"We should adopt multiculturalism.
Multiculturalism is the appreciation and respect for a variety of cultures within a single state.
We do not think that any particular culture has claims to the welfare and well being of a state, as every state in our newly globalized world depends on one another to actually survive and prosper.
We believe that putting a single culture above all others and forcing individuals to assimilate or be removed from the state ultimately is oppressive and removes the ability for the state to improve meaningfully.
With that in mind we would support the following model: that all states -duce the total amount of money and total amount of policy which goes to promote a single culture and instead invest in cultures in general.
Three arguments for why this is good: first is innovation.
We believe that if we can prove that multiculturalism is good for the individuals of the dominant culture then there's no reason not to adopt it.
Why do we think it is good for society and good for the economy?
Individuals from a variety of cultures have different lived experiences.
They different cultural understandings and different cultural practices.
In terms of the service industry this means that individuals can provide different forms of service, different forms of massage, hotels, food, which would otherwise be inaccessible by individuals of the dominant culture.
We generally think that a marketplace of diverse options is preferable to homogeneous societies where you don't have a meaningful choice between a variety of places.
So first we think this'll this will improve the well being of individuals.
But secondly, innovation is based upon the lived experiences.
It is based on the experiences you've had and the education you had as well.
Because different cultures educate individuals differently, and provide different lived experiences, we believe that multiculturalism generally leads to a greater amount of innovation.
If I can be an active discourse with people of the variety of cultures, I am far more likely to learn from them and be able to innovate meaningfully.
If there's a particular kind of tool that is not used in my culture but is used in other cultures very prominently I can then use that tool to actually improve my quality of life.
As such we think this will lead to a better quality of life for all individuals and it's clear that we should adopt multiculturalism.
Now my second argument is just about the the right to respect.
Why individuals have a right to articulate their own culture and be respected for it.
We believe that individuals are only meaningfully empowered if they can follow what they believe is the good life.
By adopting multiculturalism and allowing all individuals to actually follow their culture we allow individuals to define and pursue their definition of the good life.
This is always preferable to a state enforced or community enforced idea of the good life where individuals are forced to actually fight for things they don't truly believe in, and to waste their time and money on objects that provide them incredibly little benefit.
Because we think that all individuals contribute to a state, whether it is direct or indirect through whether it's taxes our trade, we think that individuals have a right to actually articulate themselves and have power in every single state.
My third argument is about egalitarianism.
Because we believe that adopting multiculturalism on a domestic level will inherently lead to greater rights respect on an international level as well.
Why is this the case?
As individuals adopt multiculturalism more ideas can get to places of power.
This is both economic as individuals can start new businesses and get more money, but additionally they're more likely to get votes in the political sphere.
Because if I am, say a muslim in a christian society, that will not inherently disqualify me from office.
We believe that as more diverse people get into power they're more likely to push for egalitarian policy.
This will help the poor this will help individuals of a variety of different creeds, but it will also help the global poor.
That is to say, it'll put money towards developing states.
These are the states that have largely been attacked and exploited by the larger states, and as such we believe there's a reciprocal obligation to fend to help them and help them continue to prosper.
For this reason we should adopt multiculturalism."
"The motion for today's debate is the united states should abolish the electoral college.
Two main areas of clash: the first on the true representation of people and what it means to be a democracy.
We tell you that at it's core, a democracy is about providing equal representation to all people living underneath that system.
Obviously the system isn't perfect.
It is impossible to get every single person living within the united states into one room to come to a consensus on policy decisions.
This is why we have systems that elect our representatives to make those decisions on our behalf.
But this doesn't change the fact that those representatives ought be as representative as possible and actually represent the people who are voting them in.
Just as we recognize that it is bad when those with more money are able to lobby their way into more policy we also tell you that is antithetical to democracy to give people more votes based on their location.
At the point that it is the fifth time that the electoral college didn't match up to that of the popular vote and someone was elected who wasn't truly chosen by by the people through the majority.
It is time to institute a system where the leader is truly chosen by the people.
More than this, we tell you that the old pragmatic arguments for the electoral college no longer exist.
Current technology allows us to make it for votes to be counted effectively with very low risk of fraud.
Which means that currently it is completely possible for us to have a more direct election of our presidents.
More than this, we don't we think the winner takes all policy destroys individual voices and leads to the kind of apathy that we regret in the current status quo.
I am unlikely to vote, unlikely to care about the presidential election outcome, because I live in a in a state where the vote is already decided because my state always votes blue.
What this means is that even if I am a hardcore republican, I'm unlikely to show up to the polls because I know that my vote will not be represented in regards to what president actually gets chosen.
Secondary of clash has to do with what we think this affects societally.
We tell you that the system in which every single state gets two representatives in addition to their population based electoral college vote undervalue cities and allows rural areas with lower populations, such as states like wyoming, to have every individual person's vote worth more than other people surrounding them.
We tell you this is a problem on two levels.
First, it's probably bad if just because I live in wyoming, my vote matters four times more than someone living in new york.
But more than just the principal reasoning as to why this is bad, it's also problematic because wyoming is almost eighty five percent made up of white people, whereas the majority of people of lower classes, the majority of people of color are living in much more urban areas, in cities such as new york, portland and philadelphia.
The problem is that the electoral college system systematically undervalues the votes people of color and minorities insofar as it places more votes on those who are living in less populated areas, traditionally that are less populated as well by people of color.
More than this, we tell you that the way that this changes campaigning means that instead of advocating for all states and all people equally, what happens is that individual political parties will choose to advocate only to swing states because they know they are the only ones truly making decisions about the election in regards to the electoral college.
It means you pander your not only do you only campaign in those areas but you also pander your policies to specific blocks that get you those states.
For example, getting in any given election where florida is a swing state, it is much more likely that candidates will pander to the floridian elderly in order to try and get the electoral college state rather than looking at rising demographics of young liberals living in highly populated cities.
But more than this, the next step to this is that if you are a president who's trying to go for a second term, there are certain stances you cannot take even they might if even if they might be politically preferable because you're afraid that you won't get elected for the next term because of swing states.
For example, few presidential candidates are likely to actually like actually repair our relations with cuba because they are afraid of losing floridian cubans and thus the floridian vote.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"Multiculturalism brings more good than harm.
So in this debate, by multiculturalism what we're talking about is when new communities, predominantly immigrant communities choose to keep plots of elements of their own culture rather than completely integrate into the new culture of a country that they've just moved to.
So if you think about chinatowns in some parts of the world, for instance, that would be a good example.
And by bringing more harm than good we mean that there are probably benefits and harms to either side of the debate but we're going to prove that the good is outweighs the harms.
Two big arguments then: the first is about the tolerance that multiculturalism promotes within a society.
We tell you that in order for people to become more tolerant you need to bridge the empathy gap.
In other words, people need to be able to empathize with those who aren't similar to themselves.
The best way to do this is to have them interact day to day with people who are from a different background from themselves in a really obvious way.
We see that, for instance, people who don't know anybody who practices islam are probably more likely to be islamophobic than people who live in a neighborhood where there are muslim people.
In the same way we think that this is especially important for young people.
If you want young people to grow up being tolerant of others, being willing to accept people from different backgrounds and judge them based on their merits rather than their intrinsic characteristics, then you need to socialize those young people with people from other cultures at an early age.
It's very difficult to overcome entrenched biases later in life, it's much easier to just normalize young people to the idea that different people have different beliefs and that's okay and it's something that we can all tolerate and celebrate.
We think that multiculturalism does this better than pure integration because if you think about really integrated immigrant communities, think about italians in america, say.
It's true that there is some element of distinct culture that remains to this day but the celebration of that culture takes place entirely within the context of the dominant culture which means that young people aren't actually being normalized to accepting a different culture when they learn about italian american culture.
They're just seeing their own culture reflected in a different light.
We think that you need people who don't completely integrate in order to build this sense of tolerance.
You need this multiculturalism so that people have to come to terms with something that's outside of the dominant culture of their own country.
And we think that the reason why all of this tolerance is so important is that it will make it easier for people to work with people from different backgrounds, make it easier for people to be accepting of immigrants, and ultimately make your country more united and stronger.
Our second argument is about the exchange of ideas.
We think that there is no one culture that has everything figured out in the world.
We see that different places around the world have different norms for how they treat elderly people, how they treat people of different sexual orientation, how they approach religion etcetera and we think that different cultures have different strengths, might be a good way to think about this.
In other words, western culture, where lots of people are emigrating to western countries, the dominant culture's at these western countries still have lots of cultural ills.
They have baggage from previous eras that they haven't shaken off, they have shortcomings.
For instance, the way that elderly people are treated in a lot of western countries is shocking to people from other regions because the elderly are left a pretty much fend for themselves in retirement rather than being taken care of.
Using this as an example, we think that if people come to western countries and bring elements of their culture with them that include better ways of treating the elderly or better ways of engaging with people of different religions, whatever it may be, that this will make the culture in the western country ultimately superior to what it was before because it can adopt the best traits of these cultures that come in from around the world.
So we think that this exchange of ideas leads to a marketplace of ideas, where the best ideas ultimately will win out and you get a stronger more beneficial culture for the people who live there as a result.
So for these reasons multiculturalism brings more good than harm."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should fight illegal immigration.
We're talking about the united states.
Were fine with this coming along with increased quotas for immigrants, were really happy to have plenty of legal immigrants, we just don't think that we should accept illegal immigrants.
Or stop the like fight against having illegal immigrants.
Two main areas of clash, first on preventing conservative backlash.
Recognize every time the united states is soft on illegal immigration conservative groups and individuals make the lives of all immigrants, legal and illegal ones, very difficult.
We see rises in vigilante actions, the vandalization of businesses, like town become inhospitable, there are towns that will put signs up that they don't want immigrants there.
We see children being bullied in schools, we see people refusing to hire them which forces individuals into less regulated fields that are often more dangerous and don't provide a good payment.
And these are actions that hurt both legal and illegal immigrants in that like if I'm someone who has an accent than the person who hates me doesn't care whether or not I came to that country by illegal mean.
And we think these these backlashes have other very like firm political impacts as well, if you don't think that these kinds of impacts are bad enough, in that we see that like when a certain population feels particularly unheard, they tend to elect a lot more extreme presidents and rulers.
Like we think the way that trump got got elected was massively because a large population thought that obama had been too soft on things like immigration, too soft on drug policy, and so they said: "" okay we're gonna over adjust into the opposite direction. ""
And we think that these kinds of politicians do a lot worse for future policy than being harsher on illegal immigrants in the short term will ever do.
Recognize that this is like the difference between like just like regular old policies, like: "" oh yes.
We just don't want you here.
You'll get deported if you get caught. ""
Things like that, verses like walls and ICE raids and like a very intense like looking into fighting illegal immigration in other ways.
Or like tightening of quotas that these kinds of politicians often do which prevents legal immigrants from coming in as much.
So we think that insofar as like not fighting illegal immigration and being soft on illegal immigration actually creates a worse world in the future, we would prefer to have a baseline that is bipartisan in the status quo in then just build from there.
Our second area of clash is about the importance of the rule of law.
Because recognize that the laws of a country exists to maintain order.
In that I'm willing to like go along with these laws because I recognize that I'm going to be protected from other people who break the laws.
In a world in which there is no enforcement of laws there's never an incentive not to do things that are bad.
Because I know I'm not going to be punished for it so I might as well do things like steal or harm or do all of those things.
And regardless of how arbitrary borders are, recognize that they are also very necessary to maintain national separation and efficient use of resources.
It would be really really difficult for a single nation to support a population that is rushing across borders in terms of just like how many jobs you have available, things like that.
And we think that's like quite bad.
But the other problem we think like what happens on their side of the house is that it's also just like worse to have an unenforced law than no law at all.
Once a law exists it needs to be followed.
Otherwise people don't know how to predict their lives and they lose trust in that law, which feeds into all be pragmatic impacts of the first argument.
People who feel like their country is being ruled by lawlessness are infinitely more likely to elect extremists, they're infinitely more likely to take justice into their own hands.
And we also just think that people ought to be able to predict how their lives are going to go.
There needs to be an incentive to immigrate here through legal means.
There needs to be an incentive to like generally respect the the law that of like a nation you're going into.
And not enforcing one law oftentimes indicates a lack of enforcement in other areas as well.
So we think that this has like flow over harms in terms of how much people trust that nation.
Proud to propose."
"We should privatize ports.
What do I mean by this?
We tell you that ports are just what they sound like.
It's where you load unload ships.
There's a huge amount of infrastructure that goes into this process such as cranes in places where ships can dock and infrastructure to deal with containers.
So these can be massive industrial centers that employ huge numbers of people and in most areas, especially in the united states, these are publicly run.
So you have, for instance, the port authority of new york and new jersey that runs the new york city ports.
There's a combined port authority for los angeles and long beach.
Those are the two biggest ones in the united states but we see similar ones around the world as well.
On our side, we think that when they're owned by governments that they should be sold off to private operators rather than operated by the government directly in the future.
So our first of three arguments this evening is that governments are ill-suited to run these ports.
Government bureaucracies have no special knowledge about what it takes to run a port and what the shipping industry actually needs.
Government bureaucracies are often very conservative and unlikely to change anything with an attitude that if it ain't broke don't fix it but unfortunately, oftentimes that means that they fall behind and fail to adapt to the needs of the industries that they claim to serve.
There are many reasons why this is problematic and we'll come back to that in just a moment, but we think that ultimately the biggest problem with having the government run these ports is that there are actors who just know better how to run them.
We think that in our world, it's very likely that you would have a handful of companies buy up many ports and that as a result they could consolidate bureaucracy to reduce overhead and also share expertise and knowledge from larger and smaller ports.
It might be the case that new york city has a well run port.
I don't know if that's true, but we can imagine but that other smaller ports like baltimore are less well run.
Again, we can imagine.
And if that's the case we can share expertise between the well run and less well run ports and help to improve them to ultimately drive down the cost of shipping as a whole and I think that that's the biggest impact in this debate.
If we can drive down the cost of shipping, we can reduce the cost of almost every consumer good and this has huge benefits for everyone in society especially those who need cheap consumer goods because they're low income, or fixed income, and can't afford to pay higher prices.
Our second argument is that port management is just a poor use of state funds.
All government money is fungible.
If we don't spend it on one thing we'll spend it on another.
We think that at a time when governments are struggling to pay for things like education and healthcare, that they should prioritize these essentials over auxiliary expenses like managing ports and airports.
On our side, we would prefer to let private entities take on the day-to-day cost of maintenance and not worry about doing it for governments especially since governments tend not to see a huge amount of revenue from this.
We're still okay with having taxes on things that enter through the port but we think that the cost of maintenance and any profit from operating the port itself should be privatized so that governments can focus their resources on essential goods.
And our final argument is that this would ultimately lower shipping costs.
I've already mentioned why this would be good, but I want to explain more clearly why it would be the case.
If ports are privately run, then now you can negotiate port-to-port on where you want to bring your goods much more easily.
If a port is owned by the city of new york they don't have any real incentive to cooperate with you because why does the city of new york care if a big shipment of pens and pencils from china comes in through their port instead of through baltimore?
They probably don't have a big incentive to make money especially the bureaucrats who managed this.
Where as a private port has much more incentive to be profitable and therefore they'll do everything they can to drive down shipping costs so that people will ship through their port and this will help everyone.
For all of these reasons, we should privatize ports.
Thank you."
"We should adopt a zero tolerance policy in schools.
So a zero tolerance policy is a very strict enforcement of school rules that bans the possession of certain items or that prohibits certain behaviors.
So an example of this might be that if we had a zero tolerance policy, we might suspend anybody involved in a fight, no matter whether they started it or why the fight ultimately began or their role in participating.
We would suspend everyone equally.
That would be an example of a zero tolerance policy for fighting.
So a couple of reasons why we should actually implement these policies.
The first is that existing punishments are likely to be arbitrary without a zero tolerance policy.
And we think that this is likely to break down on certain biased lines.
For instance, right now, basically when you don't have a zero tolerance policy, you rely on teachers or principles to make a value judgment about whether a student deserves to be punished.
Maybe they make good decisions sometimes, but other times they likely make very poor decisions.
It seems quite likely to me that white teachers and administrators might be more likely to punish young black boys in school for fighting than they would be to punish white boys because of the empathy gap between people of different races.
They're more likely to be charitable towards someone of their own race than other people.
So we think that the only way to implement policies that are not left up to the racism or internalized biases of administrators and teachers, is to have the same policy for everyone.
Namely a zero tolerance policy.
The other side is going to say, well that just hurts everyone it doesn't help anybody.
But I think it's quite likely that if you implement these policies that you'll see a reform of school rules to reflect common sense better.
In other words, if you suddenly have a wave of boys being suspended for fighting, then maybe the penalties for fighting will be made less severe.
I don't know, they'll have to write, I will not get into fights, on the white board a hundred times or something like that.
So we think that ultimately this is less arbitrary and will lead to better policies in terms of actually preventing disciplinary infractions.
Which leads nicely to our second argument about better deterrence.
In order to prevent young people from misbehaving in school you need to offer some deterrence.
We think that extrinsic motivation is important to getting young people to do the right thing because they haven't yet had the kind of moral education that leads them to have this intrinsic motivation to do the right thing.
So how do we deter people?
If you know that being charming or funny can get you out of an offense, because there's no zero tolerance policy, than many students will do the wrong thing and then be able to get away with it.
We think that a zero tolerance policy means students will have to accept the costs of their actions, be responsible for what they've done, and not be able to weasel out of it.
And that this will lead to a stronger deterring effect than what you would see if you didn't have such a policy in place.
When students think that they can just weasel out of anything they've done wrong.
Our third argument is that we think this helps students out on the aggregate.
Realize that if you think about the eighty-twenty rule, probably twenty percent of students cause eighty percent of the problems.
We think that at that point it's important to remove trouble makers from the classroom so that the majority of students are able to learn and benefit themselves.
We think that right now if you don't have zero tolerance policies, then the students who act up, who get into fights, who cause trouble, are likely to continue that behavior to the detriment of every other student who just wants to learn and try to get ahead in life.
So we think that while zero tolerance policies may fall harshly on certain individuals, that they benefit the aggregate because most students wouldn't be affected by this policy because they behave and don't cause trouble.
At that point, we should adopt this policy because it allows us to reward good behavior, punish bad behavior, and allocate more resources to the students who actually want to learn as opposed to students who want to cause trouble and mischief.
So for these reasons we should adopt a zero tolerance policy in schools.
Thank you."
"We should subsidize massive open online courses.
So these types of courses are often taught in a college classroom or taught by a university professor but they're published online.
There's informational material that's published with these courses so that you can follow along.
It often allows you to take classes along with the students in the class and we think that these are hugely beneficial and definitely deserve a subsidy.
So we're going to talk about how why lifelong learning is not only incredibly beneficial but is going to be necessary for the current generation.
Let's talk about the modern world: the modern world is changing at an incredibly fast pace.
This is the fastest rate of human expansion of exploration, of growth, in the history of humankind and we have grown more in the last decade as a species than we did for thousands of years from our inception to the industrial revolution.
In the past one could get an education or learn a trade and they can work off of that education and that baseline training until their retirement, until their death, but the same isn't true today.
As the world changes the the job market changes.
More technology becomes available that makes old human jobs obsolete and also spurs the creation of new jobs based around that technology.
We think that if you do not have a world in which people are constantly creating new skills for themselves, in which they're constantly learning and becoming more informed, you fall massively behind and we think these courses provide crucial information.
Three things: first, a framing in an understanding of where the world is headed technologically and socially.
Taking courses isn't just about building skills but is about building an understanding of the world that we currently live in, the potential of the worlds that we could live in in the future, and it allows people to plan for the future, it allows them to not only decide which future they want to live in and know the possibilities, but to actually plan based on what's what is likely to happen ahead of time and to become more informed as an individual.
It also provides well taught education that instills new skills that can be applied to new markets.
It insures that as jobs and the requirements of jobs change, people do not themselves become obsolete.
If I'm working in a particular field in which technology is moving in, but I can learn enough to use that technology to my advantage, to leverage that technology to open new career paths, then I am not going to end up unemployed.
I'm not going to end up in a situation which I can't afford to feed myself.
We think that when you when you amplify this from the individual level to the societal level it becomes clear why this is good for society.
It's better to learn on the job rather than to lose a job and have to enter the unemployment market.
If you learn while you're employed you don't need to worry about the stress and time scale of acquiring a new skill at the same time as having to find a new job entirely and also feed yourself, feed your family, all of those things.
It's also good just for the labor market of the state to have many dynamic workers because as more workers that are skillful become available more technological jobs migrate to the united states because they require those type of skill levels in order to actually do the labor that they need to have done.
Having dynamic workers means businesses are more able to fill new roles and it also means that you're likely to have higher wage workers because you're not just some person that can be easily replaced but you you are a dynamic individual back into a number of roles.
We think it's the job of the government to protect the well being of its citizens and the well being of its citizens are intrinsically tied to their financial and economic well being.
In a changing economic environment, in a changing job market, new skills are crucial and massive open online courses are an immense benefit in learning how to change with the world.
We think this is a fantastic use of a subsidy given the trade offs that are possible and for these reasons we should subsidize massive open online courses."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban extreme sports.
What we mean by this is that there would be no competitions or public events in which extreme sports are featured or promoted.
We think that there are two scenarios in which a government can ban something: first, that it has uncontextualized personal harm and the government is protecting their citizens essentially from themselves, or in a situation in which the spillover harms society.
This is because the government has a interest in the good of society, given that this is what they are first created to protect, but second, because a harm to society oftentimes then impacts the stability of said government or the stability of said state.
Any one of these can be met in order to justify a ban, and we tell you that extreme sports meets both.
First, let's talk about the personal harm.
When you do an extreme sport correctly, there usually is no physical harm, because it's as simple as maneuvering a mechanism and at the end of the day, that machine, if maneuvered properly, will not hurt you.
Because it is like a matter of technique rather than a matter of like anything else, people often imagine that they're going to be okay because they cannot contextualize themselves making these mistakes.
This is oftentimes called the god complex, and a lot of the time it is basically just that people think that they are unlikely to make mistakes or essentially unbeatable.
The problem with this is that especially in terms of extreme sports, people are very, very accident-prone and oftentimes miscalculate how successful they're actually going to be.
As such, extreme sports has one of the highest death rates of any other more brutal physical activity, even exceeding those such as boxing or wrestling.
It's also an incredibly useless sport pragmatically.
There isn't a physical fitness aspect and it's very expensive in that you have to fund like bikes and other like mechanical equipment.
It also specifically targets kids, using like children's sports equipment and like starting events at a very young age.
These children are even dumber and are more likely to make mistakes, but they also have but they're also much more fearless than an adult.
Whereas an adult might look down a cliff and like sometimes question their ability to go down it, a child is likely to just drive over it, especially if no one is watching.
We think that at the point that the government is justified in banning bike riding without helmets, they're also justified in banning driving down a cliff on a child's bike insofar as both of these actions are equally stupid, and one of them is actually much more dangerous than the other.
There's a much much higher risk of me dying as I jump off a cliff rather than me dying because I fell off my bicycle while I was riding down my neighborhood path.
Our second area of clash is why extreme sports specifically promote bad societal norms.
First, we'd like to talk about toxic masculinity, because extreme sports embody this in their purest form insofar as the entire sport is literally whoever can do the biggest trick and the most dangerous trick gets the most credit and, like, is the best person at this thing.
This promotes this concept that in order to be real men or truly masculine or truly masters of the sport, you have to put yourself in danger and prove yourself to be better than others.
We think this is mentally problematic for the people participating, but it's also a very patriarchal institution.
There are very few women who participate in these kinds of circles, and it breeds very sexist views because it is so closed off.
In the same way that trump can defend his locker room talk, we think the same kind of thing occurs in these circles, because when you don't have women in a certain circle to contract problematic norms or call out bad behaviors, you're going to have men supporting each other in these bad behaviors, because they like to have these taboo moments with each other.
It also creates a dangerous future for kids to aspire to.
As we told you earlier, they uniquely market to kids, as they use children's bikes, scooters and skateboards, and they're easily accessible, because most children have a scooter in their garage from a fairly young age and have access to training youtube videos.
As such, we don't think these things should be allowed in society any longer.
Happy to propose."
"Humanitarian aid should be subsidized.
Basically what we're saying is that western liberal democracies, so areas that tend to be more privileged and have more developed states, should be putting money into the subsidization of humanitarian aid whether it is within their own countries or I think with this debate more importantly discusses is maybe about putting that money abroad and into humanitarian abroad in other less developed countries.
Three main arguments, first on promoting good in the world.
I think first and foremost these kinds of arguments are always going to win this round because even if the other side might come up with some political arguments about why there's going to be backlash or even why they might discuss why there are other citizens who are harmed, as long as we show you that the people who help are being helped to such a magnitude that it is bigger than any kind of support that could be provided in other areas, we win the round.
And I think that this is the type of thing that just automatically close to our side because when you put money into humanitarian aid you're providing people with the basic necessities that otherwise oftentimes would not have survived without them.
So you're doing things like supplying basic medical care, you're sending food, you're sending like medication and professionals to do job trainings and these are really situations in governments where you don't have the infrastructure the way you have in a lot of western liberal democracies to have those be government duties.
What I mean by this is that in the united states we do things like put money into programs that accomplish these things for the citizenry in the status quo, but these other countries don't have that so sending humanitarian aid and subsidizing that process makes it more likely that you save those people's lives which is always just going to be a very big deal because those are exactly the kinds of things that are taken care of in more developed states.
We also think it facilitates economic and societal growth.
Aid can educate and provide start-up materials like that you have things like heifer international that like will give a live animal to a households that they can then proceeded to sell the milk or breed of breed livestock and make a living off of that and what this does is it essentially creates a procyclical effect in which you cut the cycle of poverty and allow them to start growing and developing on their own.
And it also does things like encourage globalization and global cooperation.
When you provide humanitarian aid, it's a sign to other countries in the world that you are willing to do your part to help out each other, that you're willing to be cooperative and that you prioritize humanitarian aid because you're subsidizing it which makes it more likely that in the long term you're going to be able to foster good relations with those countries in other ways like through trade and through research and all of that.
We think this is generally a good thing for western liberal democracies like the united states to participate in and promote.
Our second argument is about making up for it with the past actions.
Recognize that a lot of western liberal democracies have participated in colonialism whether we're talking about british taking action in african states and in india or we're talking about the US in south america, all of these things have essentially been situations in which these more powerful countries have just kind of gone in, messed a lot of stuff up, asked countries to change all of their economic development and growth for markets that oftentimes were never willing to consume enough so destroying their economies, and engaging in wars that devastated those countries' economies land and people.
And this was often done for the economic and political gain of western liberal democracies even as it came at a massive cost to the countries where this was happening but barely impacted those WLD's.
So we think that when we do things like subsidize humanitarian aid all we're doing is compensating for the problematic systems that we've participated in in the past in allowing those systems to recover from the damage that we have done.
Our third argument is about can and so ought.
Subsidizing humanitarian aid would be a tiny amount of money in the context of US government expenditures or any western liberal democracies.
It wouldn't hurt the citizens of that nation at all, but would make a massive difference for the people in those other countries.
So hence by not providing the money that we can and have the ability to provide, the US and other western liberal democracies directly contribute to the suffering of the people in those nations and we should stop doing that.
Proud to propose."
"We should abolish eminent domain because it's a violation of people's property rights which is incredibly important.
And the reality is that oftentimes what the government seizes isn't even going towards a good genuine public purpose anyway.
So let's start by laying out just what on face is wrong with eminent domain.
And it comes from the fact that the government is basically forcing you out of where you live, where you've lived possibly your whole life and for generations, and is trying to like say: "" oh well we'll make it up to you by just giving you some compensation, just giving you some money. ""
And I don't really think that that's an okay thing for the government to do because your, where you live, your home is one of the like most important things to you.
You can have like a whole lot of money invested in that location, you can really have like deep ties to the community.
There is a whole lot of things that keep people from wanting to like stay in the place that they're currently living in.
So that's why it's important to make sure that we have really like strong norms against just like taking people's houses away.
But eminent domain is something that is widely abused right now in a lot of ways.
Most notably the legal standards that are in place for eminent domain it only requires like a rational reason it has to pass rational basis constitutional test, which is pretty basic kind of a thing.
What it does is it considers does the government have some kind of vaguely rational reason, and if so they can basically just give you a bit of money and take away your house and whatever else they want.
So I think that the entire system as it exists right now is pretty abusive in a lot of ways.
Moreover, I also think that these like like limited amount of money that the government does end up giving you, especially because it's like a forced government sale, so you're only going to be able to get so much money out of it and the government can force you to surrender your property, then whatever like limited amount of money it may not be enough.
It may not help you with relocation, it may not help if you're like in a place where it's already affordable and you can't really afford to move to a lot of newer places, maybe you bought the house like a while ago and you've owned it for now, for like a while, but even with like the current value of it you couldn't maybe afford to buy a new place even if you got compensation, there is like community ties and things like that that simply are going to be easily replaced, so all of those are really bad as well.
But the next thing that I wanna talk about is how we're actually, like what's the benefit of eminent domain in the first place?
Because if there's all these harms that are existing, what's the point of even doing it anyway?
There aren't really always that many.
The idea that eminent domain is used to build like schools or various public necessities is kind of a is like a fiction.
You have like recent supreme court cases like kilo vs.
City of new london which established that it doesn't necessarily have to be some kind of public good or public necessity that you're using eminent domain for.
It can just kind of vaguely fulfill a public purpose and that's still enough.
So if your vague public purpose is like spurring the economy by like giving a corporation some new place to build its own like headquarters, like what was happening with I believe it was like a phizer plant in new london connecticut when this was happening, then basically it can just be used like the government as an arm of corporations and other kind of vaguely public interest but not really, taking away your property.
Or like like development companies that are basically just able to profit off of these like take your property for like really minimal value and then try to flip it in like they can make all the profit and they have your land and you don't really get left with all that much.
So I think for all those reasons we should abolish eminent domain."
"The right to internet access should be protected.
So, we want to start by making the model for this round very clear in explaining why we think this model is important and why it should be upheld.
So firstly, two parts.
First, we think that the right to publish, host and do other things on the internet should be unlimited within the current boundaries of free speech law.
So, we don't think that the internet should be a place in which laws don't apply, in which individuals aren't held to the same restrictions that they otherwise would be in our civil society, but this doesn't mean that you can deny people the ability to host things that you may think are problematic if they would otherwise be able to do these things in their own private lives, be able to do these own these things in public discourse, within the current boundaries of free speech law.
So we don't think that the internet should be given additional restrictions outside of that free speech law.
We also think the access to content should be guaranteed.
You should be allowed to have a public connection to the internet, and people should be guaranteed the right to interact with the internet, to have a forum and a face and a place on the internet, and people should be guaranteed internet access.
All right, so why do we think that this is a right not just a a good that people can have, but a right that they must have?
We think that the internet has become ubiquitous.
You need it in your everyday life for employment, for socializing, for commerce, etcetera.
In order to live a well-rounded social life in our modern day society, you must have an internet connection.
You must have a presence on social media or at least the ability to interact with various outlets in which our social society has become so interconnected, whether it's twitter, whether it's reading the news online, whether it's facebook, whether it's being able to connect with people through blogs or on reddit or on any other type of forum.
These are all necessary parts of our current social sphere in the same way that going to public forums a hundred years ago was a necessary part of interacting with the social sphere, of going to political rallies is a necessary part of the or being able to access those types of things a necessary part of your political enfranchisement.
The same thing goes for things in the economic sphere.
In order to get a job in the present time, you must have a presence online, whether that's being able to have a profile on linkedin, whether it's being able to have an email address so that businesses can contact you and you can contact them in reverse, or being able to access job posting sites.
All these things are necessary.
And furthermore, commerce is obviously something that, again, has become entirely driven through the internet, whether it's big websites like amazon or being able to connect with small businesses through their own sites.
All of these things are part of our human lives.
All these things are part of our human connections and all these things are fundamental to being able to live a fulfilling life.
If you're crowded out from the social, economic and employment spheres of your own life because you do not have a guaranteed right to the internet, because you don't have a guaranteed right to access the internet, we think that your ability to function within society is massively undermined.
We think rights are determined by their underlying necessity for people to actualize in life, to have a high quality of life.
We think that that is the underpinning of all rights that are guaranteed within our society.
Given that that's the case, we think that the right to internet access clearly falls along those lines.
While maybe you won't die if you don't have a right to internet access, you also probably wouldn't die if you didn't have a right to free speech, but you can't self-actualize if you aren't if you aren't able to express yourself in the way that free speech laws require.
The same thing is true of the right to internet.
You cannot be a fully interactive, a fully connected, a fully maximized person that maximizes their employment potential, their potential in the free market and their potential to socialize with human connectivity, if you do not have access to the internet.
This is a modern need, but it is a need nonetheless.
And given that that is the case, the right to internet access should be protected."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should end progressive taxation.
So, the model for this is going to be a flat tax.
That is to say that there will be no tax brackets, so none of the like, you make a lot of money, you get taxed at thirty five percent, and you make a small amount of money, you don't get taxed at all.
We would just say that everybody gets taxed at whatever the average of the current tax rate is.
So we would try to make this revenue neutral, at least in the status quo.
I will provide arguments for why in the long term it will actually be revenue positive, but we will basically say whatever the average person is taxed right now, tax everybody at that level.
So probably something in the middle like like fifteen to twenty percent.
So, two arguments under this.
First, that it will simplify the tax code in a way that improves collection efforts.
And secondly, that the status quo penalizes wealth in a way that is both unfair and economically harmful to the country.
First on the simplicity arguments.
I think it's important to note that with a flat tax, there won't be loopholes.
Things like tax shelters are going to be less proliferated, be under the realization that there is no incentive to change the definition of what bracket you're in.
So, in the status quo, somebody who's just over the line for going into the next tax bracket up, has an incentive to hide a little bit of their wealth to wind up in the next bracket below.
We think that that therefore is going to go down when you have a flat tax, because there's no incentive to just throw lots of your money into this illegal thing.
Now, I think it's worth noting that obviously opp is going to say oh, but people just have an incentive to hide wealth because that wealth won't be taxed if it's hidden.
I think people make a risk calculus that when they hide wealth.
Because generally speaking, this is an illegal thing, and you can get in a lot of trouble with the IRS, so there has to be a large payoff in order to do this.
By eliminating the bracket system, and eliminating the ability of people to easily jump brackets by hiding comparatively smaller amounts of their wealth, we minimize the reward that is intrinsic to the risk reward calculus.
So I think we decrease pretty significantly the amount of tax evasion that occurs on our side of the house.
But secondly, we would say that there's income smoothing in the simpler system, and that benefits particularly poor people.
So in the status quo, generally poor people just pay the regular amount of taxes that would be expected of them, through like money that's taken out of their check and things like that, and then they just get a big refund around like april or may.
The problem with that is that it's not smooth income, it's very like erratic, and you get your incompetent inconsistent rate.
That has a harm in terms of budgeting, because it makes it unreliable for people to like it gives people an like an uneven source of income, that is difficult to smooth out into things that are generally recurring payments that take up the majority of poor individuals paychecks, like rent and food and utilities and things like that.
But secondarily, that refund scheme actually incentivizes economically poor decision making, like splurging your refund and just having a smaller budget for the rest of the year.
My second independent argument is that the status quo penalizes wealth.
First, through cash flight, we would say that, you know basically these high tax brackets that exist in the status quo result in like an exodus of wealthy people from the country.
This means that there is less tax revenue to help the less well-off people at the bottom of the tax bracket, but also that there's less employment because generally these people are like entrepreneurs, business owners, things like that and they take those jobs with them.
But secondly, we would say that penalizing wealth in this way is just unfair.
Like I think it's pretty intuitive to say that like oh, if I like make a lot of money, that's not something I should suffer for, that's not something I should be penalized for.
So I think it's just fair to say then, that like everyone should pay the same amount of taxes, insofar as everyone has the same desert claim to the infrastructure of the state.
Like I don't think being rich makes you undeserving in any particular way.
So for all of these reasons, I'm proud to stand in proposition."
"We should ban organic food for a simple reason.
It is less safe than conventionally produced foods.
So in order to establish why this is true, when I first talk about how this about how organic food is because of the fact that it doesn't use industrial pesticides, and because of the fact that it lacks additives, it's going to make you more likely to be sick.
The reasons why this is true is for a few reasons.
First and foremost, the importance of pesticides.
Pesticides are incredibly important for controlling diseases, whether it's e coli or salmonella or other kinds of naturally food borne diseases.
This is the reason why you saw the recent disease outbreaks at chipotles across the united states of america that led to numerous health problems for people.
The reason this is true is because due to the lack of industrial strength pesticides, it's more likely that diseases are going to be able to be kept.
But furthermore, because of the variant methods it's also more likely that the diseases that the variant methods of manufacturing for these foods in a very growing methods for these foods, it's also more likely that these diseases are going to prop up in different parts of production facilities and are less likely going to be able to be controlled for.
But additionally we also think that the presence of additives in food is important to you because it reduces spoilage, and while spoilage is obviously important for making sure that food can be consumed for a longer period of time, spoilage is also important because spoiled food simply isn't safe to eat, and unsafe food to eat could be quite bad for people.
So the reason why we think that food safety is obviously incredibly important to consider as an issue is because we don't want people to be getting sick.
That obviously can lead to strain on public health resources or the individual health resources of people, it leads to less productivity in the workforce, and it's just something that it seems like the government should have an obligation to help people with.
So why do we think that therefore this risk of organic food being less safe is an unnecessary risk.
Because theoretically this risk could be outweighed or if it was shown that there were actually long term benefits of consuming organic food, long term benefits like you're less likely to get cancer maybe from these pesticides, you are less likely to get other kinds of long term illnesses that could come from using these manufactured goods.
So we actually don't think this is very likely though, because while there is rock solid evidence and there is truth to the fact that these pesticides make sure that the food is is more safe in that you're going to be getting less diseases, the science behind the benefits of organic food is quite flimsy.
There isn't really any clear scientific consensus that there's actually any benefits to organic food.
So there's no real point to deferring to that logic.
But even if you don't believe that, even if you do think that there is still benefits to organic food, we don't actually think that the average consumer is going to experience these benefits.
And the reason for that is because this is dependent on the way in which that food is actually produced, first of all at facilities.
And this is a problem, because oftentimes facilities will be using varied production means, there's not going to be a unified system like with industrialized farming that is going to ensure quality control for these foods.
So this means that you're not necessarily going to even get the greater nutritional values or health attractions, because you can't actually confirm that you're going to be getting the organic food that experiences these benefits, even if some organic food does.
But finally this is also dependent on health regulatory agencies.
And the problem with this is that health regulatory agencies are oftentimes able to operate outside of the public eye and outside of public scrutiny.
But the scrutiny that they do not operate away from though is the scrutiny of people, of lobbyists, and the scrutiny of the corporation that they're supposed to regulate.
Throughout the entire world, especially in developed countries, you see revolving doors of politics, you see people who are former members of the industries become regulators of industries.
This is a problem, because it means that it essentially creates a system in which people are misled to buy organic food under the assumption it is healthier for them, and that that in reality it is less safe for them and just cost more money.
And it is for those reasons we should ban organic food."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should increase internet censorship.
What we mean by this is that we would like for there to be solid definitions set by state agencies for regulations on hate speech, illegal activity, sites that encourage mental illness such as those that are like pro or pro self-harm sites and that this would like occur as like a censorship of content that someone could like click to remove if necessary like some kind of barrier censorship.
Two main areas of clash, one on the ineffectivity of current censorship.
A lot of things that are currently supposed to be unavailable to kids are not in that all they have to do is like click an enter button to still access the site.
If we were able to remove this content we would be able to protect children and other individuals that do not desire to see it or accidentally ended up on that site.
This isn't even about porn on porn sites as much as pornographic or hateful elements hidden in seemingly safe sites.
For example, on youtube certain people post automated content that is created by aggregating content on the internet via an algorithm and a lot of this ends up being really really hateful because a lot of the internet is dominated by dark corners in which people discuss incredibly racist or incredibly xenophobic or really really violent things that probably ought not be discussed.
But and like even if you don't buy that there's a lot of content producers that do this on purpose.
They overlay sexual and racist themes on animated characters that target children and when these pop up in cues parents don't really know to prevent it because it looks really harmless and it looks like something really familiar or has the name of a familiar cartoon.
We think that there's a lot of garbage on the internet and regardless of whether or not individuals have the right to spew garbage I think we ought be protecting those who do not necessarily want to view it but are forced to because a simple click can push you into a world that you never consented into entering when it comes to the internet.
Our second area of clash however is about creating safe spaces.
There's a problem where forums like reddit, tumbler, etcetera become a cesspool of hate speech sometimes becoming forums for planning attacks, meetings, and other incredibly rights violative activities against people of color, women, muslims, etcetera.
This ups the amount of fear and attacks individuals and makes them feel incredibly unsafe and what the government is currently doing is that it prioritizes the right to free speech over the right of individuals who are feeling unsafe and like have the right to like have their own speech and we think that in situations of competing speech claims the question is just whether or not one group is being utterly silenced as compared to the other.
We think that the right to spew nonsense and garbage and hateful things at other individuals is not a right that is infinite.
We think that we often see these regulations occur in schools or universities or in a lot of public spheres where we know that large concentrations of individuals from other diverse backgrounds are going to be and we do this to protect those people because we recognize that they are often disadvantaged by society and not given the tools with which they could protect themselves.
And so we think that it's really important to make sure that these people don't have to like prioritize other people's right to be hateful over their own right to have speech or like even live peacefully.
It's also true that in cases of sites encouraging mentally and physically damaging behaviors.
There's a lot of pro anorexia and pro self-harm sites that target people with mental illnesses and purposefully either because like the creation of a mental illness or the relapse into it.
We think it's really problematic when fifteen year old girls can look up a hash tag on tumblr and stare at people who are calling themselves beautiful who are painfully thin and like to the point of death and to the point of incredible illness and like glamorize that for themselves.
And we think that regulating these things isn't taking anything away from society.
If anything it adds back the individuals that would have been tied up in these kinds of communities and would have been harmed by them.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should ban piercings and tattoos for minors.
In this round we're going to take a principled stance that minors are unable in a very fundamental way to internalize the long-term repercussions of their actions.
That minors are incredibly vulnerable to the mistakes of their past and that fundamentally the government should check for these for these poor decision making skills.
So first, let's talk about a lack of knowledge that minors have.
Children simply lack the life experience minors lack of life experience to actually understand and internalize the long-term outcomes of their harm and when it comes to piercing and tattoos these are long-term commitments.
Yes, you can get rid of these things if you really want to but those are costly and painful procedures and for the most part these are permanent effects on one's body.
You can't internalize the length and understand the permanence of something going to be on your body forever when you've barely lived.
If you're a sixteen-year-old you're going to have that type two way longer than the amount of time that you've been alive in the world already and we don't think that children can meaningfully consent to those long-term impacts.
Their future selves cannot meaningfully consent to those impacts if they can't internalize what those impacts are going to mean.
There's also a social stigma that exists around piercings and tattoos that need to be taken into consideration.
Children oftentimes don't understand the stigma because they're not in an adult world in which they interact and they see the discretions that go against people that have piercings and tattoos.
They don't see the stigma in their daily life because these things are cool an edgy and they seem like things that people would want to have but they can prevent you from getting a job.
They can prevent you from getting into a university.
Having a piercing or a tattoo can have a real implication on your long-term life prospects.
Things that you likely can't even understand are going to be impacted in the future because you haven't been placed in a situation to even know what the future holds for you yet.
Adults are just better able to understand what those negative impacts are because one, they've seen the stigmas more likely and two, they have a better sense of their future, of what their future holds and so people that are adults have a better understanding that maybe I'm going to enter a job where having a piercing is going to be problematic for my future, it's going to undermine my credibility, do all these types of things that you simply don't know about as a minor.
Many people regret the way they behave as a minor.
Most people don't think that the way they behaved as a teenager or the decisions they made were particularly wise or things that they would go back and do again.
We think it's in the best interest of the future person to prevent bad decisions and that's what the government is doing here.
Secondarily, there's no there's no rights restriction going on, so we don't think that this is violative of anything that minors have due to them.
There's no right to get a tattoo or a piercing.
Yes, you have a right to your bodily autonomy but you don't have a right to do anything you want your body.
That's why we restrict things like drug usage.
That's why we criminalize things like suicide.
There are limits to what you can do with your bodily autonomy if it's going to have a detrimental impact on you.
If you want to do this thing so badly you can still do it as well.
It's not like we're banning piercings and tattoos entirely.
We're just saying that if you're a sixteen-year-old that wants to get a tattoo of your favorite band, well you have to wait a couple of years to really make sure that you want that tattoo before you go ahead and permanently put ink on your body that's going to impact you for the rest of your life.
We think the government is entirely within its rights to act in these situations.
We don't think it's a very important or a meaningful detrimental impact on a minor's life that they have to wait until adulthood in order to make this decision and in fact we think their future selves are going to thank us.
For these reasons, we should ban piercings and tattoos for minors."
"We should privatize postal services.
In the united states, which I'm most familiar with, the postal service is an independent corporation entirely owned by the government.
Some other countries, I believe, have like government ministries that manage the postal service.
On our side what we envision is either privatizing the existing postal service or allowing privately owned companies to take over the service that's provided.
So in america we might just have a stock offering for the existing postal service.
In a country where there's a ministry that manages this we might solicit bids for private companies to come in and take on those duties.
We will argue that this will provide better service and save money for the government overall.
First, why will this create better service?
If you ever shipped anything using something like DHL or UPS as opposed to the post office you probably observed that it gets where it's going much faster.
There are many fewer packages lost.
The employees are much more professional.
Nobody's going to steal your mail.
It's generally just a better experience.
This is because private companies have to compete with one another.
So at the end of the day, we think the most important issue in this debate is going to be competition.
If the post office is privatized it will have to compete with other businesses.
They won't just be guaranteed to have money coming in from the government.
We think that this will force them to improve the quality of their service and also to be competitive on price.
Know that this will actually probably lead to the price for consumers going up.
Right now in america postage is pretty heavily subsidized but we're okay with making people pay more money to send a letter or send a package through the mail because we don't think it's a good use of your tax dollars to subsidize it.
Realize that every time I mail all my books from one apartment to another because it's cheaper than hiring a shipping company, your taxes are going to subsidize that assuming you pay taxes in the united states.
We think that people should have to pay their own shipping costs.
Ultimately, the post office serves as a subsidy effectively to a lot of businesses especially companies like amazon and ebay that ship huge volumes through the postal service at rates below what the market should demand.
We don't think the public should be subsidizing this.
So you'll get better service and ultimately you won't have to pay as much to subsidize that service on our side of the debate.
But we also think that this will save the government a lot of money.
First, I just talked about how this is a subsidy for private business and how the government won't have to pay that out anymore but we also think that because you can close down the bureaucracy that exists around the postal service right now, the government will be able to save a lot of money.
Realize that a lot of postal workers are union people who have really good pensions and we don't want to take that away from them but this is a huge expense for the government to have to maintain these people's pensions, to have to work with this union.
We think the government should honor its existing pension contracts but that it should stop taking on new ones by privatizing the postal service so that they're not responsible for it anymore.
In addition, right now the governments of most countries require that the post office delivers to every address.
So in america you could have someone living in rural maine two hours from any real city, an hour from the nearest post office, and that person gets mail for the same price that I do living in boston.
We think that this is a huge drain on government resources and basically a subsidy for people who have unsustainable lifestyles by living out in the boondocks and demanding the same service that people get in a major metro area.
We don't think that the government should be subsidizing anyone's lifestyle if they can avoid it especially rural people who are receiving basically more service for their money than urban people.
We think that's unfair.
So at the end of the day, on our side we will lead to better service, we will save money for the government over all, and for these reasons, we should privatize the postal service.
Thank you."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition in today's motion that governments have the right to regulate the internet and censor what they deem to be dangerous material.
Three independent points.
First, that you don't have an affirmative right to social media and as a result, there's no actual harm internalized by people as a result of this.
Second, that there's high risk activity that occurs, especially on social media websites, that is worth censoring.
And third, that it enables government crackdown on extremist ideologies and extremist groups that are going to create harm, because it gives them more legal latitude, especially in courts.
On the first point, that there is no affirmative right to social media: recognize that this is a thing that is new.
Life was fine before facebook or weibo or twitter or whatever social media you'd like to list came around, so I don't really see what the harm is then in limiting access to this thing that we had no access to ten, fifteen years ago.
The reality is that there are ways for people to engage in a day-to-day life without this item.
And furthermore, the unique benefits that this is supposed to bring are things that can largely exist on other platforms, things like information sharing.
There is already conversations, there is news media, there are things that exist external to social media that fulfill a lot of the functions of it that are considered vital.
So, limiting people's access to certain functions of social media isn't a massive harm.
It's a very low burden, then, to beat back these harms and demonstrate there is a thing that the government can prevent.
If this thing is worth worrying about, it's probably more significant than somebody's ability to use x function on facebook.
The second independent point is that there are a lot of very risky things that can happen on the social media websites that are worth mitigating the probability of happening.
So, for example, you can learn where to buy an assault rifle, you can learn how to build a bomb, you can learn new radical ideologies that create things like terrorist organizations and other groups that inflict massive suffering among large amounts of people.
It's important to recognize that these are things that are uniquely proliferated through things, like a social media platform, that are particularly capable of allowing people to become aware of these ideas and these methods and these ways of inflicting harm.
And the government has the capacity to step in.
The government has the capacity to be, "" no, you can't talk about x ideology that says we should kill every member of a certain race. ""
That's fair game because it mitigates the number of people that are exposed to these ideologies and by extension, limits the ability of these organizations and the people creating this harm to actually act upon the ideology and create the suffering in the first place.
My third and final point is that it enables governments more latitude in cracking down on these organizations.
So, groups that are particularly, particularly harmful, things like in the alt-right in the western world and in more the developing world, more radical groups, such as like terrorist organizations, isis, etcetera.
It enables the government to effectively crackdown on these groups.
Because when you have the legal statutory capacity to limit their ability to interact online, courts are usually going to take that as a precedent to do a lot more extreme things, something like warrantless searches or things like that that enable more effective fighting against these groups.
It enables you to actually step in in a meaningful way, that you don't get caught up in bureaucratic red tape and actually make that crackdown, actually engage in affirmative action against these groups and decrease the societal suffering that they create by their continued existence.
Look, there's not a lot of harms that are generated by this policy.
The ability to use facebook in x function is not a serious right.
The ability to talk about x thing on this specific platform is not a serious right, is not a serious benefit that can get weighed against these really tangible harms.
The types of tangible harms, the mass suffering, violence and death that is created by really extreme groups is something that's worth taking action against, and something that is worth disposing of a very, very tertiary low impact benefit in exchange for that level of security.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish the national security council's veto in the UN.
Two many areas of clash, the first in on representation of other nations, and their desires.
We think, the spirit of the UN was to create a global community, in which people get to voice their concerns in a peaceful manner and pass resolutions, that promote fairness, legality, and peace, among nations.
The the the problem is, that in order to create discourse among nations you first have to have equality, and currently the system is incredibly unequal and unfair, insofar as five nations effectively control which resolutions will get passed, and which don't.
We think that global acts should reflect other majority desires.
Recognize that the UN works massively similarly to the way that the united states works, in in so far as every state gets an amount of representatives, and in the end the constituency is are the people of the nation, and all of their voices ought be represented in the way that we pass policy.
We would think it would be incredibly unfair, if texas, california, ohio, and missouri, got veto votes, just because maybe they were bigger, or they were around first, because just because you're around first, and just because you're bigger, does not mean that other people's voices do not matter, and does not mean that, if there is a majority overwhelming you, the act should not pass.
We think that, in the end, what ought happen in the in the UN is very similar to the way that we work within democratic society, but this time your constituency is the world, and the representatives are those sent to the UN.
Those representatives need to be able to pass policy that the majority agrees with, not just the permanent five.
More than this, we think that the original reasons no longer stand.
Originally, the permanent five were those that had the biggest nuclear interests, and were the most developed with regards to nuclear technology.
But this is no longer the case.
At the point that most countries are now involved in nuclear tech, we think most of them ought also get more of a say on the UN security council.
Second to this though, another often used like piece of rhetoric, for why we ought to keep the UN veto, is that because these groups pay more money, they should get more of a say.
The problem with this is that this isn't the case anymore.
Shirt the US technically pays the most, but they haven't paid their dues in a couple of years now.
At the point that they're not being fiscally responsible, they definitely don't deserve a veto.
More than this though, countries like japan and germany pay more than most of the permanent five, but still don't have a veto.
At the point that there's no reason for these countries to remain singled out as vetoers, we think the veto ought be abolished.
Second area of clash has to do with why we think this is used to support selfish interests.
In situations where there is conflict, and obviously something must be done, resolutions often do not get passed, because the permanent five have special interest tied into this.
This is why, for years, when the UN when the UN council was trying to pass resolutions against israel, US would veto, because they were allies and they didn't want this happening.
Other examples include any kind of resolution regarding china and taiwan, obviously china will not allow for them to be regulated, when they are one of the vetoers, and can just say no to the resolution.
We think the only way, in which you get any kind of accountability for these larger states, is by allowing the UN to take actions against them, which is only possible when you remove their veto power.
More in this, we think that we think that the veto power is often used to punish these countries, other countries.
Take the example of china, when they wouldn't allow peacekeeping forces to be sent to guatemala or macedonia, because of of their support of taiwan.
At the point that this is this is often used in ways that only benefits these permanent five countries, and does not benefit everyone else, and does not reflect the wishes of everyone else, we think it ought be abolished.
More than this though, we think that it often stifles discourse.
A lot of stuff just never gets discussed, because other countries know that it will get vetoed.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should adopt open-source software.
Open-source software is software that provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone for any purpose.
It's software that can be edited by people that haven't created it.
It's software that can be changed through collaboration and we think it is the future of programming and the future of technology.
So there are two big benefits that we see through open-source software and why we should adopt this type of software.
The first is that it increases collaboration which we think leads to be better products and the second is that it increases innovation in kind of a distinct way.
It's not just that it increases innovation in the planning stage, in the creation stage of the software, but that down the line having open-source software opens doors for more innovation because you have a platform that you can edit and you can make changes to in the long run.
So first on collaboration.
When software is created for the intention of sharing and building off of the platform, we think that it's built in a spirit where you're more likely to get collaboration.
It fosters an environment of critique and growth.
It fosters an environment of openness in criticism.
To say that this software is something that can be appended by anyone that has the technical skills to do so and that they can make it better and they can make improvements on it shows an openness of development that we think is more likely to foster collaboration between people of different backgrounds, between people who are in different geographic areas.
We think that when you have a this also means that you are more likely not just not to take ownership of the software, but you're more likely to invest deeply in the software because you don't have this fear when you're developing and when you're when you're putting your ideas forward that someone is going to take your ideas and profit off of them and leave you behind.
We think that tech is a world that can be incredibly cutthroat in the status quo and because of that people are often unwilling to share secrets and ideas between each other.
So this is not only collaborative in a in a normative way but also in a comparative way.
It's much more collaborative than what you get normally in the tech world in the status quo.
We also think it's easier to actually get collaboration when anyone around the world as is able to tinker with the software.
We think this leads to a few things.
First, you get better software because you just have more technically skilled minds on the job.
You can put this idea out to the public.
You can put this idea out on forums and with other technical innovators and you can say this is what I'm working on help me build it, help me make it better.
We also think that the software is more likely to solve problems that are currently being ignored because you're more likely to get fresh perspectives into the development process.
You're more likely to get people that may not have the skills to build an entire platform by themselves, but have the skills to build key parts of a platform that really improve the software that's being created.
Finally on innovation.
After the software has been released to the public you're much more likely to get innovations that grow off of that single platform because in the status quo, for example, when microsoft releases its software you can't tamper with it.
You can't tinker with it.
You can't change microsoft word and then re-fashion it for your own purposes.
We think that when you have open-source software it's easy for anyone to make changes in order to improve consumer needs which means that when the software goes out there, you don't just have a company that's trying to continue to sell and then makes exchanges based on the idea to sell, but it actually can change based on what consumers need.
If consumers of this product needed to behave in an entirely different way, people can come together and make those changes.
There's a capability of taking a software framework and building it out to fulfill new purposes.
So in this sense open-source software creates more innovation.
Not just that it comes up that people come up with better ideas to begin with, but it also means that people are able to branch off of ideas that they have from the software they're using and they don't have to go through and build an entirely new framework just to mimic what is already being done through the software.
Because you get more collaboration, because you get more innovation, because you ultimately solve for the consumer much more with open source software, we believe that we should adopt open source software."
"We should abandon coal mining.
In this round we're gonna make three main arguments about why it's important not to coal mine any further.
The first is about global warming.
Recognize and we think that this is ultimately the most important point in this debate.
Whether you our other arguments doesn't compare to the importance of global warming.
Global warming is the biggest threat to humanity.
It is indisputable at this point that global warming is being caused by human actions and by COTwo and fossil fuel emissions.
Global warming is doing things for example like raising sea levels which is especially impactful because it destroys economic hubs in cities which are largely located in coastal regions because these coastal regions are historically the most economically viable because they open trade routes.
There's also more extreme weather events which in addition to costing hundreds and thousands of lives every single year from things like hurricanes and tornadoes and blizzards and these other more extreme weather events that we've seen especially in the last few years, it also cost millions and billions of dollars in economic damage when a city like houston is totally ravaged by a hurricane that it was simply unprepared for.
Global warming is also causing a lack of food and clean water.
The reason for this is that when you have increased heat it leads to more water being evaporated from fresh water sources and ultimately that water is more likely than not going to result is going to end up in salt water sources which means we're losing reserves of fresh water but also seasons become far more irregular because of the global warming patters we've seen which means that you can't have predictable farming seasons and you have a lack of food.
We are rapidly approaching a tipping point of no return at which our projections to of global warming will exceed a certain certain amount of temperature over the next fifty years and it will be impossible to reverse the damage that we've done so far.
We need to care about global warming and we need to care now not only for our own survival, but the survival of the children that will be born into the world following us, children that had no control over the harm that we've brought on our planet and had no control over being born into this situation.
We only have one planet and one opportunity.
Sustainable energy in the form of clean energy is essential to make this change happen and coal mining is entirely counterproductive to this occurrence because obviously coal mining does not burn clean.
It burns and increases the problems that we're seeing in our society.
It's increasing its it's increasing our rates of global warming.
That is unacceptable.
Secondly, we think that there are fungible resources for energy.
There are fungible resources that can be invested into any type of energy output and we think we need to shift to green energy.
It's so it's obviously first and foremost, it's obviously the case that there's only a fungible amount of resources in the world that's going to be spent on energy.
We think that if you move that resource from coal mining to green energy, you're likely to get far more efficient production of green energy moving forward.
We're able to expand more and more money and things like solar or wind power.
The technology that uses the technology that grows from those fields, the the solar cells that we're able to produce, the efficiency of the wind turbines that we're able to produce, these things get better and better and it means that not only does the energy green energy become cheaper to produce but it also becomes more efficient over time and more competitive as far as per unit output of energy with coal.
Finally and lastly, coal mining is simply a dangerous job.
So even if you don't think that it's important to shift to green energy funding, given the fact that we are increasing our harm from global warming, we also think that it's important to recognize that these jobs are dangerous and can often lead to the death or injury of people that work in them.
We think then on all levels coal mining is simply not a part of our current society that needs to continue.
It's a harmful and detrimental aspect of our economy and we should abandon coal mining."
"Boarding schools should be abolished.
In this debate, when we're talking about boarding schools, we mean primarily schools in which children are sent to live at the school for extended periods of time.
They usually come home for holiday breaks and over the summer.
The amount of time is not important, but what's important in the debate is the fact that the children live at the schools while the school year is going on, at the very least.
Okay.
So we have two main arguments about why boarding schools should be abolished.
The first argument is about emotional trauma that comes from this, and the second is about social harms of the children in these institutions.
So, on emotional trauma: it's important to recognize that when children are sent away to these schools, even if it is often the case that they are done that they do so during their high school years or early teenage years, it's important to recognize that these people are still are in the point of emotional development that is incredibly important for long-term emotional well-being.
A person experiencing abandonment issues in an early part of their life can lead to long-term fears of abandonment and long-term emotional trauma that can make it harder for them to form close bonds with people, that can make it more difficult for them to be kind and open to other people in their everyday activities, and can make them angry at the world and have long-term problems with socializing with other people and can form antisocial disorders.
So, why is this relevant to boarding schools?
We think that there is an important stigma associated with boarding schools as well as a signaling effect from parents.
When parents who, recognizing that private schools in an area are often have at least equal value as these boarding schools end up being, if not of at least of similar value, so there's no real massive educational benefit to boarding schools.
And given that this is the case, the child sees themselves being sent away as a sign that they're unwanted or that they're the troubled child, and as the troubled child, they they must go to the boarding school.
And that's the stigma that's associated with boarding schools in popular culture.
It's that if you get sent away to boarding school, it's because you are a problem that your parents do not want to deal with any longer.
When someone internalizes the notion that they are a problem, this can lead to them acting out in any number of ways in their future life, but it also lets them know that they are unwanted, that they are an other within their social circle and within their own family, the tightest of all social circles that individuals can be brought up within.
And given that this is the case, we think that boarding schools, more often than not, lead to this type of emotional trauma in children that leads to them facing antisocial disorders in the future and leads to them having less emotionally well-balanced lives in the long run.
So the second thing we're going to talk about quickly is social harms.
We think that a major problem with boarding schools is they form an echo chamber of those that are within the boarding school.
And while we recognize that people in boarding schools still have access to the internet and still have access to outside interaction, when you spend the vast majority of your time with the same group of people and you don't return home to an outside environment, when your work, your your daily environment is the same as your outside environment and the stimuli is the same, we think there is an immense likelihood that an echo chamber forms in which normal which norms and mores of the of that group are not able to be challenged by an outside force.
And we don't think that's the case that most boarding schools have bad norms and social mores being taught to their students, but in cases when this is the case or in cases in which the students themselves start to form these bad habits and bad social mores, we think that they are self-replicating systems in which people who are put into these boarding schools have no real way of breaking out of that echo chamber.
We think that this is a bad environment to learn your social learn how to create social interactions.
We think that this increases the long-term likelihood of antisocial behavior as well as harms those by inculcating them with bad ideas and bad mores while they're in the school.
Boarding schools don't provide any sort of immense educational benefit, but they open students up to immense trauma.
For these reasons, boarding schools should be abolished."
"Internet censorship brings more good than harm.
So in this debate we acknowledge that there are good and bad things about internet censorship.
We think that our burden is to tell you why the good outweighs the harm, not that there are no harms, and that the inverse is true for the other side.
Three arguments for you.
The first is that internet censorship is a powerful tool to maintain government authority.
We tell you that many countries around the world have governments which would face extreme opposition if people had access to information available from other countries media.
We tell you that countries like russia and iran, for instance, have people who have limited access to the internet who may not fully understand the implications of their country's actions abroad, or things that their country is done on their behalf.
The other team might tell you that it's good if people have this information so that they can remove harmful governments, but we tell you that no good is likely to come of people trying to overthrow their governments or rise up against a dictator because of information that they see online.
We tell you that it's very likely, first of all, that these uprisings will fail like many of the arab spring uprisings, or that even if they succeed that ultimately the new governments changes that they put into place will be worse than what preceded because of the harms incurred during the transitional period.
Again I would point to the arab spring.
We see that back in two thousand eleven people were very hopeful about the outcomes of the arab spring but that ultimately what ended up happening was not very much positive change for people and we see that it probably would have been better in most cases if these governments had remained in place without the conflicts that emerged.
We think that if internet censorship is a tool to avoid future arab spring-esk conflicts that we would be okay with that on our side of the debate.
Our second argument is about protecting people from dangerous information.
So the distinction I want to make is that while the last argument is about political information, this argument is about pragmatic information.
We think that governments are well within their rights to censor access to things like information on how to build a bomb, or steal a car, or otherwise put society at risk.
We tell you that a lot of trouble making behavior is limited by people's access to information.
That once upon a time only people who are gang members or part of organized crime would have been able to learn how to steal a car, or how to build a bomb, things like that, but that today because of the internet things like the anarchist cookbook had been widely distributed and everyone in free countries has access to this information.
We think that ultimately it would be preferable to live in a world where fewer people knew how to partake in antisocial behaviors or potentially violent behaviors and that because the internet facilitates those things some censorship is in order to prevent access to them.
So we would be broadly in favor of censorship of things like the anarchist cookbook or similar antisocial behavior promoting materials.
Our last argument is about preventing cultural conflict.
Recognize that things like the consumption of internet pornography have created large divides in many countries around the world, that we see that families have put a lot of pressure on people to not consume this material and that ultimately many people from conservative backgrounds want to ban it entirely.
We think that in countries where many people are in favor of banning pornography or limiting access to it that ultimately it would be, first of all, correct for governments to do so because it reflects democratic will and second of all, because if a certain culture is very conservative, we think that it's not beneficial to have material that will create cultural descent.
Ultimately we think that this will just lead to infighting and divisions within a country which might otherwise be more unified and thus have less violence and other problems.
So for these reasons, ultimately, we think that internet censorship brings more good than harm.
We think that the benefits to state stability will outweigh the limitations to personal freedom and we think that limiting access to troublesome information will also be a on balance good thing.
Thank you."
"We should not subsidize the cultivation of tobacco.
So, essentially what we're arguing in this debate is that in countries that currently provide government subsidies for tobacco farmers, that policy should be ended.
So we think that these subsidies might involve the government setting minimum prices for tobacco or providing grants for farmers to purchase new equipment, things like that.
And we think that these policies could be phased out over a period of time.
We don't have to cut them all off, you know, a week from tuesday or something.
We're fine with phasing them out over a period of years to allow people to adjust.
Two big arguments for why we should not subsidize tobacco.
The first is that the use of tobacco is undesirable in any country.
Recognize that a subsidy fundamentally is government sanction of a given product.
We see that governments, for instance in the US, subsidize the production of dairy, because we want to keep the cost of dairy low so that low-income families can afford to buy milk for their children.
Things like that.
When you subsidize tobacco, similarly, you drive down the cost of tobacco, because the public is bearing part of that cost in place of the farmer, which means that you're facilitating access to tobacco for people who otherwise wouldn't be able to consume it at all, or they wouldn't be able to consume as much.
But why would we ever want to facilitate the consumption of more tobacco?
We see that as individuals smoke more and more, they place a greater burden on public health.
Why is this so?
In virtually every country around the world, the public picks up the bill for people's medical expenses or at least, those of people in need.
You see that in places like britain, things like national health are going to pay the tab if someone develops emphysema or mouth or throat cancer as a result of consuming tobacco.
Basically, what you do when you subsidize tobacco, therefore, is encourage people to develop medical conditions that will then cost the public a fortune in order to treat.
We think that this is completely counterproductive, that you should take every step possible to improve public health in order to minimize the cost of providing these services to for the government.
At that point, if anything, we should be trying to drive up the cost of tobacco rather than subsidize it.
And realize, that many governments are doing both.
There are high taxes on cigarettes, for instance, in many countries around the world.
How does it make any sense to subsidize a product so that it is cheaper to produce, and then tax it so that it's much more expensive to consume?
Effectively, you are canceling out the subsidy with the tax.
We think it would be better if you just cut the spending on the subsidy and keep the taxes where they are, so that fewer and fewer people smoke in the long term.
Our second argument is that it would be preferable if governments let dying industries die.
Now the other team's going to tell you that the tobacco industry is growing globally and that's true, but it is not growing in many of the countries that provide the highest subsidies.
In america, for instance, tobacco production has been going down over the years.
There's less and less consumption, and as china and india are producing more and more tobacco for internal consumption.
The same is true in europe.
Tobacco consumption is going down.
Tobacco production also needs to go down.
We think that governments, rather than intervene to prop up businesses that don't make sense anymore, should focus on making it easier for people to transition to more sustainable businesses.
It is cheaper to teach a man for to fish than to buy him a new fish every day.
So, we think that government should phase out these subsidies and encourage farmers, through grants or different subsidies, to produce other products instead.
Almost any other crop that they could grow would have more social utility than tobacco since, presumably, it would cause less cancer.
And on top of that, we think that it would encourage farmers to switch over to products which don't require the same level of subsidy in order to be profitable, thereby decreasing the burden they place on the rest of society.
For these reasons, we should not subsidize the cultivation of tobacco.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should end athletic scholarships.
Basically what we mean is that that you no longer have universities offering students reduced fees for their education, based on their participation or skill in sports.
Rather, we think it would be acceptable to pay people who choose to participate in athletics once in college, given that it is exactly the same as any other job.
So, two main areas of clash: the first on the purpose of college.
We think it's important to note that college is not about the here and now but rather is about the future that you are planning.
What this means is that it can never it should never be about what you accomplish within the university but rather what the university prepares you to do in your future, and whether it will create a long term career.
The truth of the matter is that very few people can make a successful career out of being an athlete but that more than this, their success and potential at being an athlete ought not define whether they get to go to college or whether they get to stay in college.
We think that it is fundamental to the purpose of higher education that the priority be your education and not the athletics that you have to do in order to keep your ability to stay there.
More than this, we think that athletic scholarships force students to compromise their future in order to ensure that they can stay in that university.
They have to choose the short term, choose to go to that practice instead of do their homework, and choose to put hours in instead of studying for that test in order to somehow try and stay in that institution.
This is antithetical to what college is about given that it is it is supposed to be about learning to prioritize your education and preparing you for your future.
We think that all the all that these scholarships are is a way for the old men running the institution to benefit off of the disadvantage of impoverished students.
They take advantage of the fact that these people have no other way to get into college in the first place in order to and by doing so force them into playing sports and getting more money for the school through it.
We think that it is fundamentally unjust that they benefit off of the poor circumstances that students and up in outside of their control.
Our second main area of clash has to do with how it traps people.
We think that a lot of the time these kinds of scholarship target poor populations by saying that "" look, you thought that higher education would not be accessible to you because you do not have enough money, here we will allow you to do so. ""
They act as though it is a gift bequeathed upon these groups and make them feel like this is how you break through.
What happens then is that hundreds of of children train for these kinds of scholarships and only a few get in.
Rather than focusing on academics and focusing on getting a merit scholarship, they assume that based on their background this is unlikely to be achievable and focus on athletics because this is the message that is sent to them over and over and over again.
We get hundreds of success stories even though very few actually exist about that poor kid who then went to play football in college and got to have an education.
The truth of the matter is that athletic scholarships create incredibly difficult situations for students to actually learn.
You spend hours training and you have to compromise your physical health and safety in order to maintain your scholarship.
We think that first, this is physically very unhealthy.
A lot of college students who played who have to be heavily involved in sports to their to due to their scholarships often end up injured and often end up in the long term not with long term like bone injuries and like leg injuries.
But more than this and more importantly, we think this is often bad for your grades.
It makes their future uncertain and forces them in a situation where they are like depending on their physical health in order to keep them in college and in education.
The other problem with this is that oftentimes students can lose the scholarships due to circumstances outside of their control, so if someone gets an injury and suddenly can't play anymore, because you were at that university on an athletic scholarship you are oftentimes kicked out even though you couldn't actually control having an injury.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of today's motion, that we should ban hydraulic fracturing.
I think the model here is pretty simple, just that you know, basically at the federal level, we would just institute a ban on this particular practice in looking for, you know, natural gas.
Essentially, that is what we're getting here, it is very rarely anything other than natural gas that is then piped along to refining plants, and you know redistributed for energy purposes.
So, three independent points under this: first, water pollution, second, air pollution, and third earthquakes.
But first, I want to set a standard for when a ban is justified by a government, because I think that this is important to enumerate: we justify bans by externalities, that, generally speaking, free action is a good thing in a liberal democracy, but we limit action by individual people or corporations when there are large externalities on the population.
That's something that's weighed against the benefits.
So, for example, economic benefits, that might be present from larger amounts of gas, or cheaper gas, or domestically produced gas, have to be weighed against things like environmental concerns.
So what I want to do today then is weigh those environmental concerns out, and explain why they are more significant.
First on water pollution.
So, hydro fracking isn't definitionaly an an practice.
It is something that actually breaks up large amounts of like rock base, and like the you know basically the geological structures, that separate under water water aquifers, that are generally the basis for most rural water supply, from the environment above, and the pollutants that it contains.
The problem with hydro fracking is that it breaks that barrier, that, not just the gas that is being pumped and the fluids that are being used to fracture the area, but also outside pollutants come into the water structure.
Now this isn't necessarily blowing a hole through like, the wall or whatever, and allowing whatever to come in, but those fractures mean that things can trickle down onto the water supply.
So, we see this with like really dramatic examples, like what was in the documentary gasland, where people in pennsylvania had like, what was essentially oil just coming through their their faucets.
These are really extreme examples, but it's worth noting that insofar as shale basins are often close to rivers, and other water sources, because of the geological way these basins are formed, generally speaking, these worst case scenarios are actually quite common.
Second independent point is air pollution.
This is just an intrinsic factor of natural gas, that when you know engage in actually harvesting something, that when you burn it produces CO two you inevitably increase like long term pollution, that goes into the atmosphere.
So, I think it's important to recognize also, that this is like not a zero sum equation, that when we engage in hydraulic fracturing, and create energy in that way, that has to come from somewhere else.
So, the comparative then is probably, if these, to some extent, bring an investment right?
That like, there is less pressure to research green technology from a political standpoint, if you can always fall back on the cheap availability of natural gas.
So, even if in the short term, there are economic benefits to having that natural gas.
I think it's more important to take the long view, and say: okay, but that's going to mean that we don't get green technology, that is financially feasible on a large scale for a longer amount of time, and as a result of that, global warming intensifies in the short term, which has a profound long term impacts.
My third independent point is earthquake.
Hydro fracking creates earthquakes.
I'm not going to go into the science of this, because I don't have much time left, but I think it's just worth recognizing that this is like an intuitive thing, that you can probably just reason for yourself right?
Like you blow up a lot of land, you weaken the geological basis that you're standing on, over time that means like movement within the earth's internal structures just more likely to send shock waves up to the surface, because the individual plates that are between the bottom and the top are looser.
So, and earthquakes are bad, people suffer, buildings collapse, there's large infrastructure damage, things like that, also, pipelines first, and then there's more pollution.
So, for all these reasons proud to propose the motion, that we should abolish that we should ban hydraulic fracturing."
"I'm proud to support the motion that we should ban fraternities.
Three independent points.
First is the culture of abuse that exists within frat life and greek life in general.
We think that because fraternities are often hierarchies that are this that put students at the top that particularly put like adolescents that often don't have a good sense of you know control over how like a party might go or even have much experience and sort of managing this type of things, things can often spiral out of control.
It is difficult for a frat to say essentially you know we are going to draw a line in the sand during the party, this is something that is going on that we don't approve of something like under age drinking something like sexual assault.
We think then the because frats don't have the institutional basis to actually intervene meaningfully in the situations they are ill equipped to supervise these types of scenarios.
But what we specifically see is frats as being significantly worse at doing than just like your standard run of the mill party is the culture that surrounds greek life.
We think that there is often an assumption that you know frats can just sort of have a no rules approach to things that it's all like this very hedonistic kind of mindset but the problem with that of course is that like when you take this mindset, when you take the mindset of being in a frat means having whatever you want, that often enables very pernicious behavior.
So things like sexual assaults are significantly more common at fraternity parties than other types of parties because they are being run by people who are operating under the assumption that anyone who is at the party is essentially subject to their will, that they are running the show and as a result are entitled to individual people who are present there.
We think this is inherently problematic and we think that this is inseparable from the nature of fraternities and as a result justifies a ban.
Our second independent point though is that fraternities as institutions in general result in regressive networking.
So what we mean by this is that a lot of what op is probably going to tell you is that fraternities are good because it provides networking opportunities to young professionals that people who are trying to meet individuals with similar interests like particularly in the business sector often use fraternities to establish those ties.
But we think this is inherently an issue because fraternities being the basis by which these networks are created being a symbol of like elite rigor in institutions inherently tilts that perception of this is a person who is in x organization thus has credibility in favor of men.
If this is something that fraternities uniquely access it becomes something that gives an advantage to men unjustly.
We think that by banning fraternities and by extension by banning these networks from being disproportionately tilted towards men we reduce the fundamental basis for inequity in the workplace that is that from the starting gate men often have networks that enable them to get into positions of higher authority and higher employment that women just don't have access to because of the tilted nature of greek life.
Our third and final independent point though is really to preempt something that we think op is going to say that is that by banning fraternities are just like push them off campus they're just going to do even worse things without university supervision.
We think in general that argument is something that falls because universities don't do much to supervise them right now but more importantly is that we think that the ban on fraternities will send a valuable signal that is the university is specifically putting a stamp of disapproval on fraternities as an institution saying this is something with problematic, this is something that is dangerous.
We think that is a, going to help a lot of students who aren't in fraternities particularly like incoming students say maybe this is something I shouldn't associate myself with maybe I shouldn't go to these parties because this is something that has been explicitly labeled as problematic and dangerous for me.
But secondly we think it's useful because even if fraternities will continue to try to exist off campus, we think that stamp of disapproval that societal signal from the university will be valuable in in the long run mitigating their influence.
Proud to propose."
"We should end cheerleading.
When we're talking about ending cheerleading, we're not saying that the government needs to ban it, we're not saying that it's something that needs to have an explicit prohibition against it, we just think that as a society we should end the practice of cheerleading.
So let's talk about why.
We think that cheerleading is a largely antifeminist and antifemale activity.
We think that what this means is that for the vast majority of people in society given that half of people are women we think that this activity demeans them in ways that is unacceptable and that as a society we should move on from.
So let's talk about what those ways are.
Firstly we think that cheerleading is a largely female activity so that's why we think that this a largely impactful thing that has to do with women and that we think it was created through the male gaze as a hypersexualization of women and you can just see this empirically when we look at the practice of cheerleading.
Cheerleading is women putting on scantily clad clothing going out there and cheering and cheering at sporting events during halftime and breaks in order to enjoy the largely male audience that are at these events and it's a way of hypersexualization women it continues a historic trend of hypersexualization and objectification of women that we view these women exclusively for their bodies rather than rather than what they're actually doing while they're cheerleading and this is massive because it overlooks the work that cheerleaders actually put into cheerleading because when we say that cheerleading is anti is antifeminist and antiwoman it's not that cheerleading itself is something that isn't impressive that the act of acrobatics and dance and the the use of working with a team that comes cheerleading all those things are incredibly impressive but none of those things are respected by the audience that's viewing cheerleading because they're their for a different event and this is hugely problematic in tangible ways mainly in the fact that as professionals, cheerleaders are dramatically underpaid based on the hours they put in in order to be a professional cheerleader to cheer at a sporting event for professional sports team that's something that takes hours and hours of work to get your routine right to get your physical fitness to be up to its peak to get your body in the best shape possible all those things and it's a largely neglectful industry that harms the cheerleaders.
People that put in the work of cheerleading often have to do other jobs in addition to being cheerleaders just to make ends meet.
We think that given that this is that a large reason for this harm is because cheerleading is created through the male gaze that it's not viewed as something that is respectable or important or impressive and therefore it's undervalued.
We also think that cheerleading symbolically subjugates women.
Cheerleading is done is done at mostly male sporting events.
The objects of this is that women are sitting on the sideline while the action is happening cheering for their male counterparts and come on during the break to root for their male sports players.
We would prefer a world in which women are able to be the ones that are being celebrated even if doing dance is what they want to do there are other ways to express that and celebrate the hard work in female achievement that comes through cheerleading.
In the status quo, it sends the signal to society and especially at schools where cheerleading is happening that condones this type of subjugation.
It says that this type of power dynamic, the one in which women are sitting on the sideline cheering for men, is a power dynamic that we want to have taught to our children and that we want to pass on to our society.
We think that the government in the state has a clear interest in preventing this and that as a society we don't want our we don't want half of our population to feel subjugated, to feel lesser than, to feel like they are supposed to be on the sidelines while men go out and achieve.
We think that this is a repetition of horrible past historical injustices that we must undo and that while cheerleading is only a part of the problem it is undeniably a part of the problem and that we should avoid it in our societies.
For these reasons we should end cheerleading."
"We should further exploit geothermal energy.
In this round we're gonna make two main arguments about why we think it's important to start utilizing geothermal energy to its fullest potential.
The first argument we're going to make and we think the most important, is about global warming.
We think that it is an undeniable fact at this point that there is significantly that there is significant man caused impact in increase in temperature that has led to global warming and widespread environmental change.
We think that global warming is probably almost certainly the biggest threat that humanity will face in the next one hundred years.
So let's explain why that's the case.
First, global warming and the melting of ice caps leads to rising sea levels which are likely to destroy many economic hubs in cities.
The reason for this and the reason that this is particularly detrimental is that these hubs in these cities because of historical benefits of being built on water, were primarily built on water.
The largest cities in the world are not inland cities which means that our economic hubs are the population centers of our planet are the ones that are most are most at impact due to the increase in global warming, due to the damage in global warming which means not only is this going to cause massive harm to lives and people in these cities, but it's going to cause massive harms to our economies.
It's going to cost immense amounts of upkeep in order to either build dams or to move people inland.
All this is incredibly detrimental and all could have been avoided if we had switched and turned our and had changed our behavior.
There's also simply going to be more extreme weather events.
We've seen this happening in the last number of years and when these things occur, real damage happens.
Look at the hurricane season that swept across the united states and the and the and surrounding islands south of the united states in the caribbean.
These are areas that were dramatically impacted by hurricanes and storms and those storms are only going to get more frequent and worse, costing thousands of lives and billions of dollars in damage every year.
There's also going to be a lack of food and clean water due to the changing seasons that we're going to see and the changing seasonal behavior which means crop yields are less reliable and the greater deterioration of our fresh water supply from rising temperatures and we are rapidly approaching a tipping point of no return.
Something that we need to care about first and foremost right now, is changing our behaviors because we only have one planet and our own survival relies on changing and moving away from fossil fuels and one of the great ways of doing that is through geothermal energy.
It is an alternative and a viable alternative for making energy in many areas and we think that because there are no emissions from this, because there is no fossil fuels that are and carbon dioxide emissions that are coming in this, this is a great resource that we can use to shift away from our current trajectory of global warming.
Even if you don't care about global warming though, which you absolutely should, we think it is more economically utile to exploit geothermal energy than not to.
It's comparatively more there's comparatively more economic potential in geothermal energy than exist in fossil fuels.
Many fossil fuel jobs in the status quo are low paying and easily replaced labor and there's little potential for technological development in things like drilling because it's already advanced so much over the last century that we think it's unlikely that it's going to advance much further which means there's fewer high paying roles that are available.
But the new technology of geothermal energy requires new ideas, developments in manual labor.
It opens a large new sector of the economy that leads to more growth with likely little trade off for our existing economic situation.
In general, we would rather have a more expansive energy economy and even if there are loss of jobs in fossil fuels one, fossil fuels is going to need to die if we're going to prevent the harms of global warming and two, we think that better jobs will replace them in the geothermal energy sector.
For these reasons, we should further exploit geothermal energy."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban cosmetic surgery.
We think that, generally bans are conducted for two reasons, which is why our two areas of clash are: harms to the individual, and harms to society.
Because, we think that, if we show you that there is enough reason to paternalize either individuals or society, because the harms are just too large to internalize, and too large to justify from short term gains, then we win the round.
Our first area of clash are about harms to the individual.
We think that cosmetic surgery is usually used to obtain a standard of beauty, but the standard is ever changing and ever rising, which means that every time that I go and get cosmetic surgery, I will always leave with a sense of inadequacy, that I cannot deal with.
But more than this, we think that it is often used to patch over larger issues, such as anxiety, or depression, or any other like kinds of like, mental or emotional problems.
But there are two problems with it.
So we think first that money is a trade off: the money that I spend on cosmetic surgery is money I do not spend on going to therapy, or actually dealing with my problems in a more effective manner.
But secondly, that surgery allows for a temporary rust pipe, that then plunges you back into whatever problem you were dealing with.
If I'm struggling with major anxiety, because of the way that I look, or major depression, and feel like this is something that can help me deal with that, I'm going to feel better for all of the week, or all of the month, until I realize that these problems are emotional, and they all just keep coming back.
What this does is plunges people into addictive cycles, that they cannot get out of.
Because I do feel a little bit better, I go back and get more surgery, because I want to catch that feeling of being better, again.
In the very least though, if you don't buy any of that, we think that you go to get cosmetic surgery, because you're unhappy with something, and not dealing with it entrenches instant gratification, that always causes you to go and pursuit unhealthy habits, rather than healthy ones.
For instance, if I am overweight for a reason not due to, like, your thyroid or other unchangeable conditions, but just because I am overweight, we think that dealing with it through liposuction, rather than going out, and learning to live on a healthy diet, learning to exercise regularly, is bad, because in the end, that liposuction is going to leave you with a long term scar, and a long term lack of stomach, that can come back with bad conditions later.
But also, it means that you're still unhealthy, you're still following bad habits that cause things like diabetes, or other conditions.
Second though, let's talk about harms to society.
Because, we think there's a barrier to entry, obviously due to cost with plastic surgery.
At the point that only some people can afford it, but everyone are affected by the propagated stereotypes, we think that you ought protect those people who cannot afford it, rather than deferring to the rights of the few to pay for it in the first place.
We think that in the end, plastic surgery sends the message that you, individually, are not enough.
We think this applies on two main fronts: first, broadly, there are certain characteristics that are found to be generally more attractive than others.
For women, a lot of the time the target of the cosmetic surgery advertisement, this might be the size of your breasts, the with of your hips, the size of your eyes, the curve of your nose.
We think at the point that, these are things that are advertised on billboards, at the point that large celebrities, that serve as role models to young children, all participate in this, all that young girls and young boys are getting is the message that, you, as you are born, is not enough.
The issue is though that, cosmetic surgery does not change your genetics.
The things that people are embodying are physically impossible in the natural real world.
What this means is that, we are actively advertising to young children a standard they can only achieve through millions of dollars spent.
But second, we think there's a more specific message, at the point that specific features are targeted as good or bad.
We think that, when asian children are inundated that a double lead is the only thing that is beautiful, this leads to a surge in surgeries for those who are of asian descent to change their eye shape.
It sends the message that, your racial features, features that are unchangeable, and also central to your identity, are bad, and we think this ought be discouraged.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should increase student financial aid in the united states, a topic that is near and dear to my heart, I assure you.
We have two main arguments for our side about why we think more financial aid should be available but, first, what does this look like?
We think that rather than the federal government offering more loans or grants than they do right now, that universities need to offer more financial aid, particularly universities with large endowments.
I've gone to tufts university which has a billion dollar endowment and only five thousand students, and I received financial aid, but it certainly could have been more generous, and the university of california, which has a two billion dollar endowment and a hundred thousand students or something like that, and could also be more generous given that it has this money.
So we want these funds to come from universities rather than from the government.
That said, we have to main arguments.
The first is that college is now required for students in the same way that high school used to be.
Yes, it's true that many people go on to have successful careers working in trades and the like without a college degree, but the average job in a western country now requires that you go to college, and a college diploma is treated as just a proof of your competency in the way that for my parents' generation, a high school diploma was.
A high school diploma doesn't get you anything nowadays.
We think that because this is necessary for someone to be a fully fledged functional member of society if they're from a younger generation, in the same way that high school used to be, that there needs to be the same access that high school used to have, right?
A hundred years ago, it cost money to go to high school, and then it was made completely free.
We think that perhaps that's less likely to happen with college in america right now, because this is such a big business.
We do think that colleges have an obligation to increase access so that their students are able to go on and become successful, because this isn't just about getting more people to go to college, it's about letting people graduate.
Less than half of the people or fewer, I should say, than half of the people who begin a university degree in america graduate.
Oftentimes, this is because of financial stressors, because they're working a lot or because they're not able to afford their education.
So if we dramatically increase financial aid by diverting money to financial aid from other sources, we think more students will graduate and be able to get the education that they need to work.
Our second argument is about how this breaks down class barriers.
Right now a lot of financial aid is given to people who aren't really needing it.
Sometimes it's given for merit which we think is really bad, because the people who are most likely to have good high school grades and win merit aid are the wealthy, but we also think that you can help to break down class barriers when you allow students to go to the best universities.
Now, the best universities in america tend to have the best financial aid anyway.
So, right now, we have a class structure where if you are very smart and get good SAT scores, you can go to college very nearly for free, like many of my peers were lucky enough to get to do, and if you're a b student, you have to pay a huge amount of money to go to college because you're not able to get into those very low cost universities, like harvard, which is actually free for the average american.
So we think this is creating a new class.
There was a great atlantic article called "" the new aristocracy "" that talked about this, but we think that you can break down that barrier by making financial aid accessible to average students, who also have to go to college, remember, but are saddled with a lot of debt for a worse degree right now.
So by increasing access to financial aid at ordinary colleges like umass boston or other schools that aren't as prestigious but still give people an important education, we can prevent a new aristocracy from developing around the graduates of the country's best universities.
So for all of these reasons, I am proud to say that we should increase student financial aid in the united states.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban hunting.
Two main areas of clash.
The first on it being an unethical practice, because recognize that regardless where you stand on the idea of animal rights, the majority of individuals except that animals have some rights.
Given that animals still have very human-like emotions, even if not necessarily human like sentience in that they still feel pain, they still feel suffering, and these are still disfavorable conditions to them right like an animal doesn't want to suffer, it wants to avoid pain and it wants to garner pleasure.
So even if it is ethical to kill and eat an animal, even though they're arguments against this as well, it is definitely unethical to do so in a way that causes unnecessary pain.
Like we think the only ethical way in which one can kill an animal is in a way in which that animal does not feel the pain of their existence or leaving them.
That we think that this is the case because humans don't actually need to eat animals to survive, they do it because they enjoy the taste or they like think it's easier for it's like an accessibility thing and it's easier for them to hold this kind of diet but it's essentially for the pleasure of the situation.
However, we think that animals have a much higher order kind of pain here in that it literally ends their life and prevents them from being able to actualize other rights in the future, and so we think that there's actually we can't we don't think that the human pleasure can ever outweigh the pain that you cause an animal.
And moreover though we think that you especially don't right have a right to hunt to that animal down to eat it because hunting is the most in humane way of killing animals.
You can't control where your bullet hits completely, the animals oftentimes end up dying in much slower death, certain requirements of hunting often require the hunter to start training the animal before it has completely died so you are especially hurting that creature as well.
So at the point that like you're causing such a large pan in terms of killing it, you this is definitely an unethical action.
But I think to add insult to injury in the scenario, you humans often don't even end up using all of the components that they take when they kill an animal so we think that if hunting is an ethical thing to do the most ethical way to do so would be to use every part of the body such as in the way the native americans used it and because we don't even meet that minimum minimum minimum barrier we definitely should be ban that's definitely not ethical to hunt an animal.
But are second area of clash is just about why it's a lot more dangerous and why it's an unnecessary danger that we should be preventing.
So recognize that hunting always requires you to have a gun and so at minimum the effect that hunting has is that it brings guns into more guns into people's homes and it oftentimes brings guns into the homes of people who wouldn't use guns otherwise as they are uniquely and only using this gun for hunting.
And because you are keeping a firearm in your house, you are much more likely to have an accident then were you not.
Like imagine someone gets a specially inebriated and grabs the gun or you have a small child who gets a hold of it.
You it's much more likely that you'll have an occidental misfire.
The only way in which you completely avoid the danger of guns is if you don't keep them in your house and so the less guns in a house the better on side gov.
But besides just this like vague notion of putting a lot of guns in a lot of people's houses we think that it literally gives guns to children because hunting is often seen as a family tradition or family activity and so children are oftentimes starting to hunt at a very young age with their parents.
We think that it is obvious why children should not be using guns, they often don't take very good aim, it's very dangerous toy and it's much easier for a kid to make a mistake that that leads to an unfortunate accident.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should further exploit small modular reactors.
So in order to make sure this is a clean debate, we want to say that when we mean further exploit we think that this refers to building factories to produce these small modular reactors and encouraging their adoption around the globe.
So we're not talking about something marginal.
We want to see wide scale adoption of these small modular reactors and just as a bit of background, these are basically small nuclear fission reactors which are produced in a factory and then can be sent anywhere in the globe and be installed and start producing energy.
Kind of like the use of oil based generator power plants right now in some isolated locations but nuclear.
So with that in mind, we have two big contentions.
The first is about how do we spread green energy?
There are many locations that in the status quo don't have access to alternative forms of energy.
Some forms like solar power require that you be in a certain part of the globe so that you get enough sunlight.
Others like geothermal power rely on you having access to volcanoes and other similar sources of geothermal energy.
So we see that lots of forms of green energy aren't practical everywhere in the world, but people living everywhere still need power.
So how do we get power to them?
We think that because you can deploy these small modular reactors pretty much anywhere in the globe, that you can install any power plant, that they can replace these dirty forms of energy like oil based power plants in many rural areas of the globe and many isolated areas of the globe and recognize that right now these are some of the dirtiest places on earth.
Think about greenland for instance, basically all of their electricity is produced by oil burning power plants.
So it's the equivalent of running hundreds and hundreds of cars all day in order to produce enough electricity for tens of thousands of people who live in greenland.
Now you might say oh greenland doesn't have that many people, it's not that big a concern, but ultimately, the harm of burning that much oil is much greater than the harm of using traditional power production methods in a place like new york where we have economies of scale.
We think it's important that in these places the ones which are the dirtiest per capita that we can replace fossil fuels with something cleaner.
Now why do we get that on our side?
We tell you that fundamentally these small modular reactors are the first form of alternative energy that can be applied here and that even if it's expensive it will be worth it for the international community to subsidize these reactors in order to reduce the dirtiest types of energy production around the globe.
The ones that do the most outsized amount of damage to our common environment.
In particular under this I'd like to talk about how this would affect developing nations.
Consider that many countries the problem isn't energy production its energy distribution.
In a country like pakistan that's very mountainous with lots of disparate communities spread across a large geographic area, we think that it's very difficult to provide electricity much less clean electricity, but these small modular reactors are an easy solution.
If we can install them near a group of villages then it would be easy to one, improve people's quality of life by providing them with clean energy and two, to do so without having to connect them to the larger electrical grid which would reduce the cost of providing the electricity to them.
So at the end of the day, we think that these will be particularly useful in the developing world and for that reason that we should further exploit them.
Our second contention is about why green energy is a necessity?
So you've all heard on TV about peak oil and global warming.
Basically we can't keep doing the same thing and expecting different results in the future.
Burning oil and coal and natural gas are not long term solutions to our energy problems and as more and more people expect a higher quality of life as their countries develop, we're only going to need more and more energy.
This is just going to create a feedback loop where the earth heats up more and more as more people's countries develop and ultimately more people will be put at risk because of this increased energy consumption.
It is therefore extremely urgent that we provide clean energy around the globe to people outside of the global north who don't have access to clean energy right now if we're going to have a safe earth in the future.
So for these reasons we should further exploit small modular reactors.
Thank you."
"We should ban racial profiling.
So, racial profiling is when the police or other security officials stop, detain, even arrest somebody, solely because of their racial appearance.
So, this might mean that you're at an airport and the security choose to stop one person who, looks like they might be arab or even is wearing some sort of muslim head covering or otherwise appears like they might be part of a group that a stereo typically associated with terrorism.
And by ban we think that should be categorically ruled out as a policing tactic and we think that this should be the case in liberal countries around the world.
So two big arguments.
The first, is that racial profiling is unjust.
We have a few reasons why.
Recognize, that race and related factors like religion in many cases are immutable characteristics.
By this we mean that people don't choose to be a certain race and they can't change it.
If you happen to be born as an arab or black or hispanic, you didn't choose that and there's nothing you can do to change that about yourself.
We think that these immutable characteristics ought be protected classes, because at the end of the day it seems wrong to punish people for something that they had no control over.
Next, we think that it is unjust because it's arbitrary to use this sort of racial profiling.
Many people who are white americans go around committing crimes, many terrorists in the united states are white christians, not arab muslims, so it seems arbitrary to go after this one group, even if perhaps in the past some members of that group have committed a crime.
At the end of the day we think the law cannot be arbitrary, that it needs to have the same standards for everyone otherwise there is no rule of law, it's just punishing some people unfairly and unjustly.
And lastly, we think it's unjust because it's racist.
Recognize that, implicit in the kind of thinking that goes into the sort of racial profiling, is the idea that a particular race is dangerous or more likely to commit a crime than other races.
I mentioned earlier that most terrorists in the united states are actually white not arab, so we see that it's fundamentally unfair that in airports and elsewhere around the country, arab americans are harassed and mistreated for something that they have nothing to do with, these people haven't been involved in a terrorism and they're not very likely to be involved in it compared to their american fellow citizens who are white.
So we see that at the end of the day this is racist, just punishing one racial group and ignoring the things that another group does because of pre conceived stereotypes.
So for these reasons, we see that racial profiling is principally unjust and we think it should be done away for, with for that reason alone.
Next, we tell you that we want to ask you how we actually prevent crime.
So first of all we think that you need intelligence, not stereotypes to prevent crime.
If for instance you know that a given airport is at risk of terrorism, then you need to think about who in the community is likely to conduct terror attack.
And it might be that you find out that it's a muslim extremist group, or you might find out that some sort of white nationalist group.
You need to really be looking into what's going on in the community, and what your intelligence is revealing to you, rather than just relying on stereotypes.
Because at the end of the day, even if stereotypes are sometimes correct, it's because even a broken clock is right twice a day.
Stereotypes are also based on unfounded information and anecdotal evidence, and we don't think that you can use that to make important decisions about law enforcement.
It won't help you to prevent crime, and if you really want to stop bad things from happening, then you need to be gathering evidence, not relying on outdated notions about certain races.
But on top of that, we think that bigotry makes criminals.
If you're a young person who gets profiled by the police, you have less of an incentive to be part of the societal systems to prevent crime.
You're going to be more skeptical about the ability of the police to be fair and unbiased, and ultimately you're not going to buy into the criminal justice system.
And we think all of those are factors that lead to people being more likely to commit crimes in the future.
And lastly, we think that this will lead to the police ignoring covert criminals.
It'll be easier basically for members of a majority group like white americans to get away with crime if the police are only looking at minority groups.
So for these reasons, we think that you won't stop as much crime, and that it's unjust to use racial profiling.
So we think that it should be banned.
Thank you."
"We should further exploit solar power.
We're fine with coupling this with the exploitation of other green sources of energy as well, we just think that there should be more money and more like energy companies built around solar panel than there are in the status quo.
Three main areas of clash, first promoting good use of resources.
Sunlight is free and available for portions of the day in the vast majority of places.
This is unlike gas and oil that are often restricted to specific areas of land in different countries that tend to be relatively inaccessible to the united states.
We think that it is just smarter to use what is more and more cheaply and more easily available which happens on our side of the house when we go for the thing that literally any country albeit in varying amounts if I am in norway where it is dark for half the year it will be more difficult for me to run a solar panel system but I still can then maybe in the united states but we still think that it's like preferable and the more intelligent decision.
Recognize that oil and gas energy monopolies are a combination of first mover advantage and political lobbying for tax cuts.
When the playing field is level, the choice becomes incredibly obvious: that more exploitation of greener energy sources is both cheaper for us moneywise but also a lot cheaper for us environmentally.
The only way in which we usurp preexisting hegemonies is by the normalization and the exploitation of this kind of use.
We need groups like the government and more powerful actors to say that this is the preferable decision, to advertise on their behalf, and to provide money for research so that it stops being a risky investment for consumers.
Our second area of clash is about clean living.
Recognize that there are massive byproducts to gas and oil in a couple of ways.
First there are large amounts of air pollution we see in cities across japan even in cities across the united states cities literally everywhere that you will have days where there is smog, that asthma rates are going up, that it is just not a like habitable place to live when you are living in a world that is so air polluted as the status quo.
The other issue is that these kind of things leak into our water supply flint michigan still can't get clean water like we see in portions of northeastern new york that because of fracking individuals are finding large amounts of problematic minerals in their water.
But perhaps in the largest way we see that global warming and like greenhouse gas production is created by gas and oil.
Solar is incredibly clean, it doesn't hurt the consumer in the same way it allows individuals to reduce their carbon footprint without any cost to their standard of living as we might see with any kind of other green energy.
Recognize that stopping global warming is also incredibly important.
I don't think I have to tell you about how bad global warming is.
The ways in which it allows the spread of diseases to places those diseases had never previously existed, the way in which it wipes out coastlines and destroys farms, like we think that this is actually one of our top priorities and until we start exploiting other forms of energy then this isn't something that we're going to be able to change and that is very bad.
But our third area of clash is about cost.
We think that solar energy is really good for the consumer.
It is much cheaper because solar panels are a one time purchase rather than a monthly requirement but also there are a lot less cost fluctuation in that maybe every now and then there's a technological update so that the lost generation of solar panels is cheaper than whatever the new fangled technology is but realistically the majority of the time you can rely on solar panels to stay at the same relative cost because the materials that are used to make them are relatively stable.
The problem with oil is that depending on a country and that country's political desires we can have massive fluctuation in price of oil because there is much less of it and the countries that control it have much more of a monopoly on where it goes.
On a larger scale though, there is no cost to extraction for solar energy in the same way that it costs money to create fracking mixtures or pay for it to be transported across country alliance.
Proud to propose."
"If you're not a socialist before you're twenty five, then you have no heart.
But if you're still a socialist after twenty five, then you have no brain.
Socialism is the textbook example of how the road to hell can be paved with good intentions.
Pursuing equality is an admirable cause, but the inherent problems with actually achieving it, without dealing a deadly blow to the economic prosperity of the people or to their freedoms, leads us to, with a heavy heart, abandon socialism.
We understand socialism in this debate as an economic model that heavily leans on taxpayer funds for redistribution of wealth, and has a big strong public sector.
Of course that by abandoning socialism, we don't mean to cancel overnight all of the public services like healthcare or social security, but that we ought to aspire to have a small public sector that deals only with places where the market is truly incapable of working properly.
Two arguments today.
Firstly, about the free rider problem and economic prosperity, and secondly, about the grave dangers of the central planner system.
First argument.
When the government is using a large chunk of its taxpayers money in order to provide many services and offer help to the needy, it creates a problematic incentive system.
On one hand, the incentive of weak people to go out and find jobs where they'll be forced to work harder to earn their bread is being lowered when they're being promised a monthly allowance.
Dozens of researchers have proven a significant positive link between unemployment benefits and unemployment rates.
On the other hand, the incentive for strong people to work hard and earn a nice living for themselves is also lowered, because they know the state is going to bite off a significant part of their profit.
So, the market is being harmed twice here.
However, when every person gets to enjoy most of the money he has earned, then everyone has an incentive to do the best that they can that they can to benefit society, so they could benefit themselves.
This is the reason that socialist economies tend to stagnate many times, while capitalist models usually lead to prosperity and wealth.
It's true that the latter situation necessarily results in lower levels of equality, but the situation is still better off for everyone in absolute terms.
Second argument.
Socialism is a method which inherently means that like a very few decision makers are granted huge power to shape and design the entire economy according to their own private point of view, what they consider to be necessary and good.
There are a few problems with that.
A, the market is a huge system of interactions with endless information.
No matter how smart these central planners are, there's no way they're able to properly understand, anticipate and plan what are going to be the outcomes of every small interference that they create in the markets.
Not to mention like large scale reforms that socialism tends to favor.
There's a billion examples of how socialist laws that were meant to do one thing end up causing the exact opposite.
For example, raising the minimum wage tends to lead to firings and to more unemployment, and there are countless other examples.
It's much better to allow the market to lead us to like a spontaneous order and equilibrium that is a result of countless small interactions between actors.
B.
Different people have different views to what is considered good.
When a handful of people get to shape a policy that can be forced on everyone, they literally force their own agenda on countless people that aren't necessarily interested in it.
If, for example, the ministry of treasury decides tomorrow that musical education is one of the most important like like is of the utmost importance, and we have to start funding violin lessons for every child, then this policy can be forced upon everyone and everybody will have to also pay for it.
This is a severe toll on individual freedom.
And c and most importantly, note that so far we only listed the best case scenarios in which this this central planner has pure intentions at heart.
What happens when that's no longer the case, when someone gets power drunk and decides to use his power to oppress and abuse others, what happens then?
This is a constant threat that is inherent to every system of a central planner and we have to be very careful of it.
For all of these reasons, please propose."
"Organ donation should be mandatory because it saves lives.
Let's start by talking about what we're going to do as far as the actual enforcement of mandatory organ donation.
First, as far as live organ donation is concerned, you're going to be automatically enrolled in it as soon as you try to get a driver's license or register to vote or any other kind of service like that.
You're automatically going to be registered in a live in an organ donation and if you refuse to do so, once a doctor tries to call you about an organ donation, then you can be prosecuted under that, criminally.
And secondarily, everyone upon death is going to be - if they want their will to be enforced to any capacity - it's gonna to be required that you're going to be a organ donor upon death.
So now let's talk about why such requirements is necessary.
First and foremost, in the status quo, organ donation system has failed and the reason that it's failed is the way in which it has failed is obvious.
There's far too people in the system and it's incredibly difficult to find actual matches in order to get organ donations done, especially in emergency circumstances.
The reason for it is simple: people are stupid and people think that when they give up one of their two kidneys, or something else like that, they're going to maybe possibly harm themselves, or people are lazy and they don't feel like it's worth the effort to do all these kinds of things.
Now the problem is is that these things don't aren't particularly important when you compare them to the actual emergencies that can be solved.
So, how do we think that we're actually going to be able to solve these things?
First and foremost, when you require everyone to be as part of the system, you're just going to have more people in the system.
This is incredibly important because there's a whole lot of people in various locations that get sick and one of the problems that we see is that even if a match does exist, there could be limited supplies of a certain kind of match or a certain kind of blood type so you may not be able to access it right away, a match may be far away so there may be difficulties and transporting things and all of that can lead to more complications and risk.
So all of those are always are problems that are going to be solved.
So basic point of this is that you're going to save lives and that the system is going to be better.
So, now that we've talked about that and about how this is obviously going to be better let's talk about possible ethical implications.
I think as far as ethical implications are concerned, it's very clearly going to be positive.
And there's a few reasons for this: first and foremost because you're going to save lives.
So I don't think that any harm actually realistically exists for most forms of organ donation.
You have two kidneys and if you give one up you're probably not going to have many problems, if you're dead then you're certainly not going to have any kind of horrible problems, and I think that you can like any kind of argument you could possibly make - religious rights or whatever - even if you wanna take the strongest one which is probably religious rights, quite simply, lives are more important.
We don't let people practice religion in any kind of way if it means that more people are going to die, and if you practicing your religion in a certain way makes it more likely that someone's gonna die because they're not gonna be able to get an organ donation in emergency, then the state has every right to say this is what's best for the people and that what this is what's best for society overall.
But additionally I think that harms are quite rare anyway and they're very much unlikely.
I think that in most cases this can be done safe, in fact it's oftentimes much safer under this system because it's going to be done in a much like broader sense and there's going to be less need to worry about things like travel between like the coordinations and things like that.
And finally, even in the most unlikely circumstances where there is some kind of harm, most likely these harms are gonna be minor like maybe a doctor boxes an organ donation or something like that.
Then there's other ways that you can correct for this in these very select few cases.
Maybe you can have a tort lawsuit, you can sue someone for damages, any , pretty much every country in the world has provisions like this in the status quo, you don't have to you don't have to, you can just you don't have to change the entire system for these few isolated cases.
So for all those reasons organ donation should be mandatory."
"We should abolish trade barriers.
By this, we mean that countries should liberalize their trade regimes.
They should end tariffs, they should end import duties, and excise taxes, and all of these other things that make it more expensive for there to be trade.
We would like to see every country have the kind of free trade that exists right now in the european union between countries like germany and france, where goods can move just as cheaply as they can domestically.
We have a couple of main arguments for our side today.
The first is that everyone will be wealthier as a result, and the second is that this will promote international cooperation.
First, why everyone benefits from this.
There's an idea in economics called comparative advantage.
The idea here is that every country can produce something in such a way that the whole world's economy is optimized.
All right.
So you might be thinking, "" well, surely, countries like america and britain can produce everything better than very poor countries, "" but even if that were true, let's imagine that britain was so efficient that they could produce everything better than anyone else in the world, which may have been true early in the industrial revolution, it's still better to have other countries produce different things.
Why?
So, let's say that britain can make computers, and cars, and tee shirts all really well and that bangladesh can make tee shirts but not computers or cars.
Clearly, it would be better to have britain focus all of their efforts on making computers and cars and ditch tee shirts completely and let bangladesh do that, even if bangladesh isn't as good at it.
Why?
Because this will maximize the amount of computers and cars and actually maximize the amount of tee shirts in the system as well or, perhaps, not maximize, but they'll exist at the optimal equilibrium with one another, and this applies even outside of that kind of facile example to all goods.
It's always going to be better for some countries to do low effort, or low wage, or less skill-based labor, and other countries to do more skill-based labor.
With free trade, you come closer to that kind of optimal balance between all of these different goods.
So we think that this will ultimately be good for everyone because you'll get the best balance of cheap cars, cheap electronics, cheap consumer goods like shoes and clothes that you can possibly have.
So that's the main reason why we think this is so important, is that it drives down the cost of goods which, bear in mind, by the same turn, will also increase the standard of living, especially for people in the developing world.
Our next argument then is that, ultimately, this will promote international cooperation.
Why is this true?
When two countries rely heavily on trade with one another, they're much likely less likely, I should say, to enter into a conflict.
We can see that before the second world war, there was very little trade between most of europe's countries.
Countries like germany, britain, and france had largely independent economies.
As a result, they could still provide for their citizens if they went to war.
After the war, something called the european coal commission was set up.
This is actually the predecessor of the EU and as a result, italy, germany, and france were all trading coal with one another such that no one country could meet their needs for coal which, at that time, was very important, like oil today.
And because of this, it was unthinkable that there would ever be conflict between them, because all three economies would shut down, and none of them could afford to go to war with one another.
This has clearly worked in europe which has entered its greatest period of peace in history since the development of the european coal community, but we think that this could actually be extended around the world.
It's very unlikely that america and china will ever have a cold war the way america and russia did, because they need each other too much, and this makes everyone in the world safer.
It makes massive levels of conflict unthinkable because every country needs every other country.
For all these reasons, we think more trade is good and that liberalization is the best way to get it.
Therefore, we should abolish trade barriers.
Thank you."
"We should subsidize massive open online courses.
These are courses which are posted on websites, like coursera, where individuals can sign up and watch recorded lectures and pay a fee to have someone grade their assignments.
At the end, in some cases, they can receive a certificate or even a college credit for completing these online courses.
When we say subsidize, we think that students should be able to use state resources that they could otherwise put towards a traditional college in order to pay for these massive online courses.
So if I were eligible for a government grant in order to go to university, I should be able to use some of that money for these online courses as well.
We would be fine with some sort of quality assurance or to require the courses to be provided by a recognized university, but we think it should be up to the student whether or not to take them.
Our first argument is that people have a right to access education.
While this right may not arise from nature, it is true that in almost every country around the world, we see that people have a right to secondary education.
People are taught to read and write, to do basic math, the history of their country and so on, and almost every country aspires to have all of its citizens graduate from secondary school.
We don't see why the right to education should completely end at secondary school.
We think that people should have a right to continue their education.
This would be good for everyone because it would make them better citizens and more productive employees as well.
So it's good for your society and for the economy.
These online courses are an effective way to facilitate access to that right because anyone can sign up.
There's not a limited number of seats.
Only so many people can be in a lecture hall at oxford every year, but thousands or even millions of people hypothetically can watch a recorded oxford class online.
So you can facilitate this right by providing these moocs, these online courses, at a subsidized rate.
Our second argument is that this is an effective use of the state's funding for education.
If you pay lots of money for students to attend a course at a traditional university, let's say oxford again, then the students who are attending those lectures in this term are benefiting from them, but no future student ever will.
The lectures happen and then they go away.
If you paid a funded online course though, those lectures exist for every student in perpetuity who wants to use them.
So you get more bang for your buck when you set up online courses than when you pay for traditional courses.
Now obviously some things need more individual attention from a professor, and I doubt anyone would learn german from doing this.
But for courses like calculus, which are largely standardized, this would be a really effective way to share that information to more students, and we think that the state has an obligation to use its money efficiently so that it goes farther, and that subsidizing these online courses is an effective way to maximize our bang for our buck.
Our third and final argument is that this will encourage educational reform.
If universities and colleges have to compete with cheaper online courses, a few things will happen.
First of all, low-quality universities will probably close.
People will recognize that they're better off watching recorded oxford classes than going to a local college that doesn't provide good instruction.
This means that good universities and colleges will continue, and bad ones will close according to market forces.
As a result, the state will no longer be paying for the worst colleges and universities.
But what's more, it will also encourage colleges and universities to provide education that competes with the standard set by these online classes.
So if you have to compete with professors from harvard and oxford in providing a good education, then every university will focus more on a higher quality of education.
Right now, there's no incentive to compete with the best schools because so few students can attend.
But if you remove that bar, then everyone has to compete, and the market will ensure that we offer a better product at our colleges.
For all these reasons, we should subsidize massive online courses.
Thank you."
"We should ban piercings and tattoos for minors.
We think that it should be illegal even with parental consent for people who are under the age majority, such as eighteen in most countries, to get piercings or any form of permanent tattoo.
Our first argument for why this is the case is that miners aren't really able to opt into what they're doing.
Piercings and tattoos have a permanent effect on one's body.
It's true that some piercings might eventually heal, but they'll never go back to the original state.
So it's impossible to ever go back to a state in which you didn't have a piercing and while tattoos can be removed, this is a very expensive process and still leaves some indication that you had a tattoo.
So as with piercings, you can never go back to that state of not having had a tattoo.
The reason this is problematic is that it's difficult for minors to make decisions based on the long term.
People who are thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, simply don't have the life experience to decide if they are going to want to have this tattoo when they're seventy five.
Most of these young people are going to be thinking of the short term because that's all they know and also because the brain just isn't done developing until the early to mid twenties.
So we think it's better to prevent people from making an irreversible decision at a young age that they might regret later.
Moreover, we think that we stop young people from opting into all kinds of harmful activities.
It's true that we let eighteen-year-olds smoke and not seventeen-year-olds and that may seem arbitrary but there has to be a line somewhere and this seems to be the place to draw it.
Now obviously tattoos and piercings aren't as bad for your health as smoking but it's clear that we limit young people's autonomy sometimes because it's just true that the government knows better than children in some instances and we ought defer to protecting young people rather than letting them make harmful decisions until they're at such a point in life that they're able to really think these things through.
But the next thing I'd like to do is just ask you to weigh the benefits and the harms of this policy because I think that it's really obvious that this should be implemented.
The worst harm that I can think of to banning these tattoos and piercings is that some people might be very upset that they're not allowed to do what they will with their body.
So the worst case when you ban this, is that some people will be unhappy.
But I'd like to point out that this will only last for a couple of years.
Very few eleven-year-olds say are seeking out a tattoo and if fewer young people got piercings, the norm would probably change such that it wasn't normal for young people have piercings and they would be less desirable.
So ultimately you get all of the benefits of preventing people from making a decision that they'll regret later or preventing people from getting a tattoo or piercing that might hurt their ability to get a job or get higher education because of stigma, and you're weighing those benefits to our policy against minor irritation that a young person can't do want they want.
We tell you that teenagers are going to be annoyed with authority figures no matter what you do.
So even if you were to let them get tattoos and piercings they would find something else to be unhappy with their parents and teachers and the government about.
So there's really no harm to banning tattoos and piercings from minors.
If getting a tattoo or a piercing is really important to someone they're still free to do that as soon as they reach their age of majority.
So we're not really limiting anyone's freedom in the long term just making them really think something through.
In fact it seems quite likely to me that if someone really wants a tattoo, they will have had to have thought it through by the time they turn eighteen if they've been thinking about it for years and that there will probably be better outcomes for everyone.
So ultimately because children simply can't consent to getting this kind of tattoo or piercing, and because there are really no harms to implementing this policy, we should ban piercings and tattoos for minors.
Thank you."
"We should further exploit nuclear power.
When we say we're going to further exploit nuclear power, this includes allowing for subsidies to occur, that and increase the investment in nuclear power, allowing for tax breaks that allow for nuclear power to be more prolific, and more business friendly, and more economically viable for new entrepreneurs to enter the field, and start developing this power.
You would also increase the regulatory capacity of the state, so that these things can be put out, and used more frequently, and overall we would ensure that there are structures in place, for a robust use of nuclear power within the state.
Okay, so two main arguments, the first is that there is a massive potential, that resides within the use of nuclear power, and the second is to explain why, in the context of other power options, nuclear power is not as dangerous as the popular imaginary beliefs.
Okay, firstly, on its potential.
Recognize that, nuclear power has the ability to use a very small amount of fuel to establish a massive amount of power.
This can be used in small nuclear reactors, that can power city blocks, and it can be used in large reactors, that can power entire cities and entire areas for a long period of time, creating yes, nuclear waste, that needs to be dealt with, but also this waste can be contained, and used and contained in a way, that it doesn't necessarily, and it's not intrinsic to it, in creating these harms.
This is what's especially important about nuclear power is that it's flexible.
So, it is one, there is no nuclear fallout, a safe resource and a safe way of gathering energy, and it's a much more flexible than other types of reusable energy, renewable energy resources that we have.
So for example, unlike solar power, it doesn't require being in a place that has an immense exposure to daylight.
Unlike wind power, it's not reliant on of been located in a certain area, which means that it's geographically viable in all locations, and it's versatile in such a way, where it is a sustainable energy source, that, if perfected, is going to, in the long run, be more versatile, and more useful, in a wide variety of areas, in ways that, no matter how much you perfect solar power, it's unlikely to be useful in areas, that have very long winters, or do not get exposed to sunlight on a regular basis.
We also think think that it could be scaled down, and for for smaller use in ways that ensure sure that, it can be particularized to the area in which it's being used.
So secondly, we think that the danger of nuclear power is dramatically overblown.
While the while popular narratives about nuclear reactor meltdowns, and things like this, are popular in our imaginary, in our social consciousness, what's important to recognize is that, based on the amount of usage, so based on the the prolific nature of its use, it's actually the case that, there is more degradation, and more damage done from oil spills per the amount of drilling operations, and different transporting operations, than there is from nuclear power.
So yes, it's natural that, because there is more oil being used that there would be more spills than there are nuclear power meltdowns, but the damage done by these things, in proportion to their prevalence, is actually much higher in using these fossil fuels.
Given that this is the case, we think the stigma around nuclear power plants is massively overblown.
Given that we are willing to take on the dramatic ramifications of oil spills, which include polluting water supplies, damaging, almost permanently, environments and ecosystems that are in these areas, we think that we should be willing to take on the risk of nuclear power, given the prolific and versatile nature that it has.
There's also an immense amount of room for innovation in nuclear power, that hasn't been tapped in the status quo, because of the fact that, there's this massive stigma against it, and allowing for nuclear power, allowing for the development of this resource, would allow for energy independence for all states.
It would mean that, if you can perfect nuclear power, because you can use it in any location, it isn't reliant on on mining for resources that simply cannot be reproduced, on oil that is going to damage the environment, in a way that nuclear power simply will not, we think that there are massive benefits to be gained, and the risks are much smaller than people make them out to be.
Given that this is the case, we should further exploit nuclear power."
"We should ban boxing.
So, what we mean by this is that we think that countries which have strong regulatory agencies for sport ought to ban boxing.
Nothing tricky about what boxing is, you know it's what mike tyson and all these people have done.
So, three main arguments for you: the first is about why we think the government needs to intervene.
We think that the state should ban a certain behavior when there is a lack of information available for one group participating in that behavior.
So, in this instance we think that boxers lack information about boxing that would allow them to make intelligent decisions.
Realize that the companies that promote boxing make a great deal of money off of people being willing to participate in this activity.
What that means that you have lots of businessmen who are interested in convincing young people that it's perfectly safe to box, that there's absolutely no risk to their long term health and that they'll make lots of money and get famous by choosing to do this.
None of which is really true.
There are tremendous risks from concussions, as we've seen with not only boxers but also other athletes, that have a long term health implications, and in addition most people never go on to become successful boxers.
We think that at the end of the day, the health risks greatly outweigh the vast wealth that someone like mike tyson might be able to accrue because of boxing.
So we think the state should intervene to protect the boxers who lack access to good information about boxing.
The second argument that we're going to advance in this debate is about why we think that boxing promotes violence.
So, it seems pretty intuitive that a violent sport would encourage young people to view violence more positively than they would otherwise.
Realize that when young people grow up lionizing boxers, they're lionizing people who hit each other to solve their problems in effect.
We think that at the point where we wouldn't accept school children hitting each other or behaving in this fashion we shouldn't encourage it on the public stage either.
Lionizing an activity normalizes the behavior in society.
It's not just that, you know, impressionable children are going to fight more if they look up to mike tyson, it's also that a culture which features boxing as a sport that's widely admired is more likely to admire violence writ large.
We think that for instance the lionization of soldiers, the lionization of police and of violence in general is much more likely in a society that celebrates violent sport.
We would prefer a world in which violence was seen as an unfortunate necessity when it does have to occur, rather than something which is to be celebrated and glorified, and we think that boxing is incompatible with that view of the world.
But certainly, a world like that would have less violence, fewer people suffering from violence than the world that we live in today.
The last argument that we're going to advance for you in this debate is that we think boxing is harmful for sporting culture.
Recognize that boxing, which promotes these very high stakes fights between two people, I think that the fight between floyd mayweather and manny pacquiao was one of the most expensive paper view events of all time.
Boxing encourages sporting culture to focus on one major event rather than on achievement over time.
We think that people are less likely to look at careers of excellence in other sport as something to celebrate as a result of boxing's prominence, because they're more likely to focus on one match, or in this case one fight.
But on top of that we think that because boxing is such a friendly sport to gambling and betting, that it introduces more gambling and that because boxers are notorious for throwing fights in order to win money, that this introduces more corruption into the sporting world in general.
We would prefer that people focus on team sports, which promote good values as opposed to boxing, and in addition we would prefer that they focus on sports with less gambling and which are less prone to corruption.
So at the end of the day we should ban boxing because of this lack of information for boxers, because it promotes violence and because it harm sporting culture.
Thank you."
"We should end the blockade on the gaza strip because it ultimately doesn't really actually solve all that much and it does more than harm does more harm than any real good for everything from the peace process to international perceptions of israel, and it's also immoral.
So let's start by talking about why it doesn't work.
The biggest reason why it doesn't work is pretty obvious: it's not like there's a shortage of terrorist attacks in israel and this blockade has been happening for almost a decade now.
It's not like hamas isn't firing rockets every day.
It's not like hamas isn't having terrorists going on to buses and bomb people or stab people or do all these kinds of things.
It's not like there's still a very real threat of terrorist attacks that is happening in israel oftentimes.
So it's so it's very clear that if the blockade is working at all for funneling supplies in, clearly it's only doing so much given that illicit black market supplies and bombs and weapons and guns are still finding their way into hamas and other kinds of militant terrorist organizations' hands in in the gaza strip.
So you already probably should end something that isn't working because you're probably as the israeli government spending a whole lot of political capital and money on doing this kind of a blockade, but the picture is even more dire than that.
Because I think that you're because I think that the when you actually look at the way the gaza strip blockade works, it's incredibly restrictive.
And it's very restrictive in the way in which a whole lot of supplies really aren't able to find their way into the gaza strip.
And this is why you oftentimes see things like shortage of like medical supplies or humanitarian supplies and things like that.
And even when these things do ultimately find their way into gaza, the blockade drastically slows the process of getting them in and constricts the supply that's able to get in, and it oftentimes also suplics the countries that are able to get it in.
So let's say like if you're iran you're probably not going to be able to give humanitarian aids to poor people on the ground in gaza even if you'd like to do that.
So it like does things like it artificially restricts the ability of people in gaza, who are a ton of people who are innocent civilians, for actually getting help.
So that creates a really really big problem for numerous reasons: first, it's kind of immoral and it's immoral because it results in people dying.
Most people don't die from israeli drone strikes or israeli like targeted strikes on like where things hamas terrorists are.
Most of the time people are dying because of like starvation, complications from health problems, a lack of access to food, like there's all kinds like those are the primary lack of like basic sanitation things like that, the fact that there's no electricity, the fact that you probably aren't able to work, like like a full time job because of all this instability.
Like these are the real reasons why there's so many problems in the gaza strip.
And those things are much more directly tied to things like a blockade than they are to anything else.
And that creates a spillover problem because the reason why you could have a blockade for ten years and not see any fucking progress is because you're doing the same thing over and over again and you're still going to have people suffering and when people are suffering they're more likely to be violent.
Because when you're unemployed, when you or when you see like when you're not able to like support your family, when you see like your friends around you dying, when you see all of these bad things happening to you, and when on the basic level you're able to like look it israel as this evil other, because they literally put walls around you and restrict your movement, restrict your ability to do anything, no matter who you are, just based on the where you just based on where you're born, this probably pretty understandably creates a lot of negative impressions for people that are living in gaza.
So this is why it's so easy for hamas to use propaganda to keep recruiting more and more terrorists that keep doing terrorist attacks over and over again.
There's never going to be a shortage as long as the conditions on the ground are ripe to have an existence of terrorism in the first place.
But finally, even if none of that matters, this hurt israel's international perceptions which is way more.
It makes it so that boycott divestment sanctions is going to be more powerful because it's going to create more of a like people are going to hate israel more, it's going to create more political problems for israel, it's going to create long term economic problems for israel and it's going to keep being a financial drain for israel as well.
So for all of those reasons, you should probably and the blockade of the gaza strip."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of today's motion that prenatal diagnosis should be mandatory.
First, the model.
So I think first like what's really intuitive about the model is that sort of the government would just subsidize the procedure to minimize the impact that this would have on the individual, like particularly the mother.
We would also say that the standard for when governments are justified in making something mandatory is one of two things: either one, utility, just that it makes the world a significantly better place, and any sort of like privacy or like minor autonomy rights claims can be just weighed against the mass amount of suffering that the policy mitigates, but secondly is prevention of third party harms.
So I'm going to demonstrate to you why we need both of these standards, but I think it is important to recognize that if either one of these standards is met, that is sufficient for a government for like mandatory policy.
So on the first of these standards, that it is something that is just naturally utile.
I think this links into the parents' right to know about things that will happen to them in the long term.
So, recognize that there are effects on the parent that happen as a result of birth defects, right?
Like significant costs they have to incur, emotional trauma that is intrinsic to this, and I think it is important there that the parent has this knowledge.
Opp is going to tell you oh, but like they can just opt into this, and they have that decision making power if they want to.
I think that's a bad standard for two reasons.
First is that a lot of parents have this mentality that it could never happen to me, that these terrible tragic things are something that happen to other families, and you are unlikely to actually buy into this thing.
So, necessarily in the status quo, because this isn't something that is subsidized, that is even more likely to result in parents saying, I'm not going to get the prenatal diagnosis.
Obviously if we make this mandatory, the government has to subsidize into some means, I'm pretty sure that is actually just like compliant with the general way we view the role of government in our society.
But secondly, we would say the opt in standard is bad, because parents generally don't have meaningful access to the information surrounding the likelihood of a lot of these defects.
I think people think of just a small subset of these defects and say oh, but those are super rare, and they're like oh, okay well you know down syndrome affects like one in every however many thousand kids, that's probably not going to happen to my kid especially because it's hereditary.
But the sheer magnitude of the number of these types of disorders that could potentially affect your child, means that this actually is something that could potentially have a pretty profound impact on your life, and I think therefore it is important to give the parents access to that information, even if they are not aware of the fact that this is something that is a probable outcome.
But my second independent point is that this is intrinsically important for the child's rights.
So, I think it's pretty intuitive as to why this is something that affects the child.
Necessarily these types of disorders can cause a lot of suffering.
But also a lot of them, particularly the physical disorders, the impact can be mitigated if you have this like on site care at the time of birth, that if you are aware of this through the prenatal diagnosis, you can take action almost immediately and significantly mitigate the harms of the disorder.
Things like spinal like like spines growing in improperly and like other bone structure things, things regarding your cardiovascular system.
There's tons of physical disorders that can be significantly mitigated if you are aware of them beforehand.
So it's intrinsically important to the child's rights then that this prenatal diagnosis happen, because when these terrible things do happen, it's important to have the ability to combat them in a meaningful way.
That's a big utilitarian impact just in terms of the sheer amount of suffering that you mitigate by having that preventative care, but also in terms of the rights claim, it's important to recognize that the child is a innocent bystander in this situation, that they have a strong desert claim to the mitigation of their suffering insofar as it's not like they did anything to deserve that, it's not like they made any decision that actually caused that suffering, so we would say that the government has an obligation to mitigate it in any way possible.
Proud to propose."
"I am proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should abolish speed limits.
So, specifically the way that we are going to, you know, model this out is , for one, we're going to make it specific to like highways and other places where, you know, high speed is something that we're actually okay with.
Obviously, we're not going to put this on like side roads in like rural areas, but we would say that what we'll replace speed limits with is strong enforcement of anti-tailgating laws.
So what we mean by this basically is that instead of a limit on how fast you can go, we would instead enforce a limit on how close you can be to other cars.
The first argument I want to advance on this is essentially why there's no capacity to enforce both of these laws rigorously and why the tailgating laws are actually significantly more important.
So, on capacity to enforce both: this is essentially just an onerous burden on highway and traffic cops, really, to try to get both in.
You know, you need to be paying pretty good attention to your radar technology to enforce a speed limit effectively.
And likewise with enforcing tailgating laws, you have to be paying just very close visual attention to the proximity between cars.
And this is a problem.
I mean this is a serious issue in terms of , you know, being able to enforce both.
So you you have to choose one or the other, and as you can see in terms of the way that highway enforcement in the united states works right now, clearly the speed limits are preferred.
I think the reason then why it's significantly more important to enforce the tailgating laws is that this is just what determines whether or not cars are actually going to have a crash.
It's about not about speed.
Like if two cars are going ninety consistently, it doesn't matter then, because if they're far away from each other, you know, the fluctuations in their speed that will happen bit by bit aren't going to result in a crash.
What matters is the tailgating frequent on highways.
This is what drives a lot of crashes is cars that are simply getting too close to one another.
So I think then if you create a system where drivers, instead of being discouraged from going fast, are simply discouraged from being very close to one another and, of course, the fines, you know, the structural incentives work the same as they do for speeding.
Right now, you're afraid to speed because you're afraid to get a ticket.
Likewise, you'd be afraid to tailgate for fear of getting a ticket if that was the way that these laws were enforced.
So, given that the tailgating then is significantly more important to reducing traffic issues, I think this is just the better place to put your priorities.
Our second independent point is really just that drivers will self-regulate.
So, when we look at the way that speeding works, pretty much everyone breaks the speeding limit.
I think, you know, if you're in like a sixty-five, everyone goes like seventy or seventy-five.
And the reason for this is just the the best speed to be at, on a highway, is just higher than the the level that speed limits are currently at.
There's a certain level stability that comes with going a bit faster.
People are just more comfortable moving at that speed, and they do obviously have a desire to get places quicker.
So, I think when you allow people to make that decision , you know, they're not going to change significantly.
They're already breaking the speed limit with a decent amount of frequency.
But people will self-regulate properly because people getting in crashes like, that's the disincentive they have against doing something that's legitimately dangerous, right?
Like I might really, really, really want to get to where I'm going, but I also don't want to die in a car crash.
So I don't think people will really go any faster than they personally feel that they're capable of handling.
And this is the thing with speeding is that you very rarely see these accidents occur because of speeding.
It's usually because of some other factor combined with speed.
So like drunk driving, obviously, there's a lot of speeding, but that's because they're drunk.
It's not a speeding thing as much as it's just a a DUI problem.
So I think, generally speaking then, lifting the speeding laws won't have a significant effect on safe driving habits.
Proud to propose."
"We should ban cosmetic surgery because of the impact that it has on people's emotional health and the financial costs that it imposes on people as well.
So in order to show why we think that these harms are likely to be realized, we're going to first talk to you about how legalized cosmetic surgery leads to an culture in which cosmetic surgery is glorified, and it creates false ideals of beauty, and that ultimately this is what leads to those harms.
So how do we so how does cosmetic surgery do this.
So we would say that cosmetic surgery oftentimes leads to people changing their body in ways that they otherwise shouldn't.
Whether it's models that are like are plastered around on advertisements to look in a certain way, or advertisements that say that you can look better if you get something like a botox or a breast or a breast augmentation surgery.
We believe that these kinds of procedures are what leads to an entire culture where ultimately this is the expectation for how you should look.
And we believe it is when the a when a culture creates this kind of an expectation for beauty, it means that cosmetic surgery oftentimes is something that people feel pressured into getting, something that they feel that they must get in order to feel wanted, attracted or lovable.
So why do we think that this is harmful for people's emotional health.
Because first and foremost quite simply, this means that most people are not going to be able to meet a societal ideal of beauty without engaging in these cosmetic surgery.
This means that in order for people to feel comfortable in their own skin, they have to go and pay for a procedure.
That's obviously something that is not good and something that we shouldn't encourage within a society.
But additionally we think that since oftentimes a whole lot of people aren't going to be able to access cosmetic surgery, whether it's for economic reasons, or parental consent reasons, or simply not knowing how to do it, or being afraid of the procedure altogether, this means that a whole lot of people are going to have a low sense of self esteem and a lower sense of self worth, because they're not going to feel like they look the same as people in advertisements, or look like the prettiest people at school, or the most attractive people who are going to look these kinds of ways.
So why do we think that this is incredibly problematic.
Given that there is honestly a higher prevalence then in a lot of cases for things like depression or other forms of mental illness, we would say that it's incredibly important to make sure that we encourage people to have a healthier outlook on their body and a higher sense of self worth.
But this is something that is directly discouraged by a world in which cosmetic surgery is legalized.
And the next thing that I want to talk about under this, finally is about the financial cost that this is often going to impose on people.
What do we mean by this?
So I already talked about how cosmetic surgery leads to a culture in which you're likely going to see people want to pursue this for in order to look better.
This is problematic because we think that in a lot of ways these procedures can be quite expensive, they can run up margined cost margins of thousands of dollars.
So when people are coerced into spending thousands of dollars on frivolous nonsense, they obviously have less money for other things as well, things that be could be quite important for them like food, support, or other things that can make them happy overall, like vacation time.
But we also think that this is quite bad in general, because what this is essentially amounting to is society coercing people in a way so they would'nt spend this money otherwise.
Something I think is a real problem.
So the final thing that I want to talk about is about how this uniquely harms poor people.
Because we think that oftentimes there's a lot of negative stereotypes that fall around poor people, like in america for example poor people are often seen if there in a racialized sense, poor people who are minorities are often seen as more hyper sexualized or more unattractive in certain ways, while poor white people are often made fun of for things like missing teeth or likes like that.
We would say that oftentimes this is in many ways contributing to a buyer culture in which cosmetic surgery exists, and the expectations that you're going to look a certain way.
And we think that in a lot of ways this creates a distain for certain groups of people in society, a distain which can also ultimately drive policies that we see of far greater importance.
So it is for all of those reasons we think that you should ban cosmetic surgery."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban human cloning.
We think currently, human cloning is used in a couple of ways.
It can be used for research where embryos are cloned repeatedly and then embryonic stem cells are taken from those embryos and the embryos are discarded.
It can be used with research with regards to genetics or modeling a person's conditions using cloning.
We don't think society has yet gotten to a point in which we are cloning entire humans and allowing them to live through adulthood but should we get to that point we would also think that that ought be banned.
Two main areas of clash.
The first on the use of humans as a means to an end.
Recognize that cloning necessitates the creation of a human being.
In research cloning also usually means the killing of a human being because the embryos or the fetuses that are created are often discarded after use and thus they're they are ended.
The problem with this is that you are using a human to achieve a goal.
Whether you're doing it because you are researching, whether you are doing it because a couple cannot have a baby and you are giving them one, by god just adopt.
There's a lot of unwanted children in this world.
Like recognize that these are still goals that you are using a human being to achieve.
So you're using them because you want to get better long term research.
You are using them to achieve the goal of making this couple happy.
The problem with this is that humans have an inherent value and it is bad to instrumentalize them because it strips them of their rights and dignity.
So say that I exist as an individual.
Recognizing that I have inherent value that stems from my ability to value myself, my ability to feel and to suffer.
If someone just comes along and says that they are now going to use me to like help them in a goal say that I'm very good at math and without my consent they like use me to get better test scores for an for like a very like loose example.
We think this would be unjustified in so far as I am a person who deserves to be evaluated as a whole human rather as just a human calculator and denying those rights allows us to dehumanize individuals stop valuing them in the long term.
So it becomes a slippery slope of sorts where we stop valuing human lives because we see it utile to ourselves to use them in research and this then becomes an expansion upon this utility where we say well maybe it becomes more utile to me now in the future to put certain humans below others and like they deserve less rights.
It these this kind of measure of human value with regards to utility is very dangerous because not all humans are going to be utile to one individual.
Our second area of clash has to do with why it exploits women.
Cloning and especially research cloning requires the harvest of many egg cells in so far as scientists haven't yet found a way to recreate a woman's like a woman's egg.
What this does is further capitalizes on a woman's body as being good for corporate use.
So in the same way that we find advertisements that use women's bodies to sell products and use them as objects to do so problematic we think this is very similar because it is saying that your body is good for capitalism and thus we will harvest your egg cells again denouncing you as a being deserving of rights and using you as a means to an end.
The problem with this is secondarily that women have a finite amount of eggs.
So what these corporations often do is target those who are younger or less informed and pay them too little in order to give up their eggs.
So it takes away the ability of these women in the future to have children the majority of the time and this is also a form of like exploiting women insofar as we don't think that everyone who is young or hasn't fully understood the risks or internalized whether they want to have children in the future or not.
We think that like these kinds of people ought also be protected.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should adopt atheism because it's correct and it's rational but also it's probably more empowering for people and can incentivize and encourage better action.
Which is great so let's start by talking about why atheism is just correct.
And the biggest reason there is that it's just pretty likely that god doesn't exist, there's no evidence of god and when you think about it most of the the theories that would like justify god's existence are absolutely ridiculous.
So for starters there's no reason why like a traditional judeo-christian god is any more likely to exist than like zeus or poseidon.
It's more likely that gods just come go in and out of fashion over time and that different cultures just developed different ways to explain the unexplainable.
So why is there lightning happening?
Oh zeus is just pissed off.
Why is there a flood?
Oh well because god's angry at the inherent sins of humanity.
Things like that.
Probably pretty easily explainable natural phenomenon that people in a more primitive time needed to find explanations for because no one likes to think, oh well bad things just happen via like probable chance bad things just happen randomly.
People are always searching for an explanation.
And nowadays we use science to explain things because that's like a rational way to do things and an actual provable verifiable way to test things.
But sometimes old habits die hard so people still believe in god because they've been told lies about god and things like that throughout their entire history.
Obviously there's no evidence of god because god is something that is an inherently unprovable concept that relies on faith rather than proof which is already a red flag there.
But beyond that when you think about the stories a lot of them just sound, on its face, ridiculous.
Like of course jesus didn't walk on water.
You can't walk on water.
It's ridiculous to think something like that.
Or the fact that like god just like created the earth out of like sheer will and then like god created like adam and eve because god just decided that they wanted people to exist or whatever.
Like these stories are just so perfectly wrapped up in a bow tie or it's just it's like ridiculous to think of such a thing.
Or why aren't why don't we live in a utopia?
Oh, because these original humans committed some kind of sin.
It's so like neatly wrapped up and like it's honestly mindboggling how people believe these kinds of things given how ridiculous they are.
And it's probably just a product of the fact that they've been lied to throughout their entire lives.
But beyond that I also think that it's just going to be better for people and more empowering for people if god just doesn't exist.
So why is it going to be better?
First and foremost, violence.
Obviously people commit violent acts for a wide variety of reasons but religion is a huge driving force behind that because religion, in an because since religion is already a realm of irrational behavior, a world in which you can't have any kind of reasonable or logical discussion with somebody because they're believing in stuff that is like made up fairy tales, they're more likely to commit violent acts in the name of god.
And while all people don't do that, it's very prominent and we shouldn't hide from the fact that for all of human history people have been oppressed, persecuted and and like violated because of god and this is something that has always happened and keeps happening and will continue to happen because that's just the way religion is.
And it oftentimes endorses violence like when the jews moved into israel god told them to destroy the canaanites that lived there and like rape and pillage their land because god doesn't care about these kinds of things because they're not true believers.
Like it goes across religious boundaries and it's always existed.
Religion is just an inherently violent thing and it endorses and loves violence and that's a bad thing.
But beyond that I also think that there is an empowering thing about accepting responsibility for our own actions.
When there's a mass shooting, when there's a terrorist attack, we shouldn't give people our thoughts and prayers because thoughts and prayers don't do anything.
They don't solve the fact that people don't have healthcare when they get shot.
They don't solve the fact that people are going to keep committing acts of violence because there's no mental health care treatment.
They don't solve the fact that people commit acts of terrorism because of political issues and bombing of people's homes.
They ignore all these things and boil it down to the most basic and common denominator and it's honestly ridiculous.
Of course we should adopt atheism."
"The motion, for today's debate, is that we should cancel the social security tax.
Two main areas of clash: the first is just an exploration of how the system works, because I think that an understanding of how the system works, quickly shows you that it cannot continue to exist.
Basically, the idea is that you pay into a pool of money that current elders can use, because in the future, your next generation will do the same for you.
For decades upon decades, this system worked, because there was a relatively equal number of elders and youth, that would pay for them.
This meant that, old people could get paid for and there wasn't a fear on the part of the young people, that there wouldn't be enough for them in the future.
But the problem is that in the current world, birthrates are decreasing, and the life expectancy is increasing.
What this means is that, there are too many elders, and not enough youth.
Think of it like this: let's say there are ten people, these ten people have twelve children total.
If these twelve children each pay a proportion of their tax into supporting these other ten people when they are older, everyone gets to share a small amount of burden in order for these people to live relatively good lives, after they are retired.
But now, the current status is more like there are still ten people, but now there are only five youngsters.
Not only does this mean that each of these five have to pay more of a tax, as shown by the fact that the social security tax has increased every year for a while now, but more than this, it means that these five people are not going to have enough children, to make up for them in the future.
We think it leaves those people stranded, but more so, leads us to a crisis and to crash, more now than ever.
Because in the end, these people have to have some sort of retirement plan, and if their retirement plan no longer works even though they paid into it, these people are stranded without another option.
We think in the end, it is simply more efficient to have them save their own money, save that same twelve point four percent, for their own retirement and pay for themselves.
Second, though we want to talk about why we think this is generally unjust.
Because, we think it's important to note that, in such a system that is proportional to the amount that you put in, the majority of the time, the problem is that it's not as if for supporting those who are massively worse off than we are, we are just supporting the elderly who used to work jobs.
At the point that this is true, we think it is unjustified for the government to redistribute wealth in such a way.
We think that, generally, people have some ownership of their labor, and the fruits of that labor.
But this program is one that essentially forces people into a retirement plan, on the promise of future profits.
It's not as it's not like medicaid or welfare, where we know our taxes are going towards helping those who are in need, but rather it's an actual retirement program, that says: in the future we will support you.
We think that, people should be able to choose what kind of retirement program they're going to be a part of.
But unfortunately, these funds are a tradeoff: twelve point four percent now means I don't have that money to put into a four o one k, to put into my own kind of retirement plan, and we think this is a trade off that is dangerous, and leads to instability.
At the point that we know, in the status quo, that there's not going to be enough money in social security for us in the future, we think this places an undue burden on the current generation to try and leave more frugally, put away more money than they have.
But also, we think that often this takes money from the lower middle class, and redistributed to those who were better off in the past.
We think a lot of the time, the elderly, who benefitted off of social security, works the majority of their lives, and, if not for the promise of social security, could have put more of that money away.
We think that there are other programs, that are going to catch those who are truly struggling, programs like welfare, programs like medicaid, but in the end, if it comes to retirement, we think social security is not the way to go.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should increase tax credits.
So, we're talking about tax credits broadly in this debate.
We think that there are a few tax credits that we are specifically thinking about that we'll discuss later, but the purpose of the debate, we think, is to talk about the benefits writ large of having a heavy tax credit taxation system versus one in which there are fewer tax credits.
So let's talk about why tax credits are so beneficial.
What tax credits allow for is that it allows the government to incentivize good private behavior, and this is something that the government has been doing for decades.
For example, the government wants to incentivize people to purchase homes.
The reason for this is that people become more embedded in their community.
They have more of an investment there.
It's also a good investment for them long term because it's a good stored value as opposed to renting.
So overall, it's a good thing for private citizens to do to purchase homes.
But it is probably not just to say all private citizens must purchase a home, because context matters, because people have reasons to not want to purchase a home, to not want to put down roots.
Maybe they don't have the money for it, maybe they don't want to be tied down to a particular area.
So tax credits are a good way for the government to incentivize certain behavior without actually codifying that behavior in law.
Another prominent example of a tax credit is one for having children, because children are obviously good for the growth of the community, children are good for economic growth, all these types of things, and because, well, tax credits make it a lot easier to have a child.
So, tax credits clearly incentivize good behavior, and we think that this is something that the government should try and do more of.
Additionally, tax credits also allow for higher overall rates of taxation and increase the potential tax pool that the government can draw from.
The reason for this is that if you can, say, give tax credits for a large amount of particularly good activities, those are things that people are able to write off on their taxes at the end of the year, which means knowing that these people have avenues to lower their tax rate, you can raise the higher marginal tax rate because most people will not be paying that rate at the end of the year.
But it means that people that are doing things that aren't giving any sort of productive capacity, aren't doing any of these things that would be beneficial to the state, well, in that case, you can then tax them at higher rates, because they're doing less in their other activities to contribute to the benefit of the community.
So, this means that when you have tax credits, it both allows for a higher, an increase in the potential tax money, and it leads to people doing better things in their private lives.
So what are some examples of tax credits that we think should be widely widely added to tax credit systems?
Well, one, you could have a tax credit for adopting solar power on your home, for getting off the grid.
If you are able to transition your home, your property, or whatever it may be to a one hundred percent green fuel or green energy, that's something that is incredibly beneficial to society.
It's something that will help, if it was to be adopted en masse, would be incredibly beneficial to the state, and this is something that you can do with tax credits.
You can also give tax credits for other green housing measures, like being a low-waste home.
Most homes give off an immense amount of waste, whether it comes in the form of food waste or whether it comes in the use of a high amount of plastics.
You can give tax credits to people to cut down on their use of these things, to be more frugal in their activity, and these are activities that we're going to need in order to stave off the worst harms of environmental damage and global warming.
And it's much easier it's a much more free option, it's a state that is more liberal and more just that incentivizes these things through tax credits than it is through outright proclamations.
For these reasons, we should increase tax credits."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should legalize the organ trade.
Three main areas of clash, first on solving the organ crisis.
Recognize that in the status quo thousands plus people die because they can't get an organ because they aren't high enough on the list of people who need organs.
Thousands more live out the rest of their lives on systems like dialysis and other life support which is incredibly painful, incredibly costly, and incredibly unnecessarily unnecessary given that we can solve these problems.
It's always going to be more important to give them life and support because they are the ones who are struggling the most with this, especially since there are plenty of organs that can be given at very little cost to the individuals like kidneys, portions of the litter liver, marrow transplants, etcetera are nearly harmless to the person especially when they buy into those harms by getting paid for them but can do an infinite amount of good for someone who is struggling or someone who's going to die for lack of an organ.
We think that insofar as this is an incredibly immediate need the government should facilitate the solution for this through the exposure of markets that individuals can buy into and have organs from and so we think this is like actually quite important.
But our second area of clash is about the abolishing the black market.
Recognize that when you that when you legalize the market it allows for regulations to exist because when it's illegal you can't regulate the market when you can't acknowledge that exists so having its existence recognized and legal means that you can necessarily pin a lot more on it.
Legalization allows things like facility checks, it allows like requiring licenses for doctors, requiring patient care like afterwards and checkups, and creates and allows like minimums on costs of organs to make sure that poor people aren't getting overly exploited.
So all of these things are preferable because recognize that a black market happens either way on opp, there are always people who are incredibly desperate people who need the money really quickly and they're always individuals who are rich enough to pay a lot for organs and like the majority of that like cost gets subsumed by the direct like by the surgeon or whoever's giving that organ over and a really tiny amount trickles down to the individual who gave way that organ.
So we think that now you provide them with an option, do they go to a black market or do they go to some more is cleaner, they're going to get paid more and they're not going to die afterwards we think that that necessarily they're going to choose the latter in a world where like both are probably going to exist.
We also think that it provides a legal avenue that lets people being protected from botched surg surgeries and like being underpaid we think it's really a lot easier to sue a corporation when the practice is legalized and you're not afraid of getting criminalized yourself so it's the only way in which ways like people you keep people from being afraid that they're going to get in trouble for something that actually cost them a lot.
But our third area of clash is about individual rights like it's unclear to us why the government gets to regulate something that people are going to be able to do with their bodies and therefore like we think they should be able to do whatever they want.
Recognize that this like only makes sense in situations where they're really like long term like very bad out like external harms like we think you ban things like meth because meth addicts are really dangerous for society addiction spillover in different groups and this is like a pertinent government interest.
But the problem with organ donation is that you can educate someone about the risks and that's something that they can consent into balanced against the amount of money that they're going to be able to make.
So we actually think that like people are going to like insofar as like first people are going to buy into these kinds of dangerous systems either way on op it's just going to be through a black market but second insofar as we think that someone knows the context of their own life more and recognizes whether they need twenty thousand dollars more than they need a kidney we think that individuals ought be able to make that decision for themselves.
But also even if you don't buy that we think that insofar as people are allowed to work really dangerous jobs and take harmful actions in the status quo, this isn't any different from that so we don't actually have a bright line for when this ought happen.
It's unclear why we would allow people to donate organs but not sell them at least this way they get something out of it.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"We should abolish the monarchy.
Before we begin, we need to clarify something because there are some different models and types of monarchies in the world, starting from models where the monarch is the de facto ruler with absolute authority on political decisions made, like in saudi arabia or qatar, to models where the monarch is a more diplomatic and symbolic figure with hardly any authority when it comes to policy, like in great britain.
For the purposes of this debate, we will argue that all these models need to give way in favor of a democratic republic.
Of course, the more authorities that the monarch has, the bigger our problem because becomes.
We'll have two points.
First, I'll explain the rationale of why we had monarchies to begin with and why this rationale is no longer relevant today.
And secondly, I'll discuss the inherent harms in a monarchy under all models.
So first point: monarchs all used to hold absolute authorities, and the legitimacy for their rule is that they were somehow able to persuade the people that they had some divine right to rule.
The royal family were nearly godlike, and that's why the title passes on in a hereditary fashion.
Now, the rationale that justifies it was that we needed some one ruler above everyone else to dictate the rules so that we can have order and avoid anarchy.
If there is no one that we can all agree that has the legitimate authority to set rules and enforce them, then everyone do as they please, which is bad for everyone.
Therefore, it's best to sacrifice some of our liberties to this monarch and get a functioning society.
But as time went by and people started becoming more aware of their own rights and demanding things from their kings, the authorities of the monarchs dwindled down until we reach the current model of a democratic republic.
And now, we obviously have plenty of examples to countries without a monarch that don't have anarchy in the streets.
All that is needed is a functioning government, a parliament that sets laws and courts who enforce them.
Thus, the old logic and rational for monarchs is no longer valid today.
The new rationale given sometimes, especially in britain, is that this institution is ingrained in their tradition and culture of this country.
And, you know, all of this may be true, but nostalgia and romanticism can only get you so far.
This is exactly what museums are for.
We're not saying that they should just forget all about their history, but it's just like vikings are a very important part of the nordic countries' history and it it doesn't mean that they should go and ravage the seas today.
We should put that behind us if no stronger rationale exists.
A monarchy comes at very high costs, and we don't think that it's worth it just for nostalgia's sake.
This brings me to my second point.
Along the years, there have been good kings and there have been bad kings.
But the biggest problem is inherently that the people can't control what their king does, except maybe for during violent revolutions when they try and overthrow the monarch.
And this is, of course, something that we would like to prevent in the future, because many people tend to die in those.
Now, because the title passes on through heritage, the king needn't worry about his seat and can pretty much do as he pleases.
In absolute monarchies, this is still true to this very day.
On top of that, having grown up in a palace, even if the king wishes well, most times he's just not really connected and fully aware of what the average citizen in his country needs.
This is exactly what democratic republics are meant to fix.
Of course, there can also be good governments and bad governments, but the head of state always knows that if he doesn't please the people, he will be removed, and this is the biggest check and balance on the power of the government.
That's important.
But even in constitutional monarchies, where the king is not a political figure per se, like the UK, there still is a huge price to pay for this monarchy.
Firstly, money.
It costs a lot of money to maintain buckingham palace and the lavish lifestyle of the royal family.
There also security costs, of course, and costs of expeditions abroad that all come from the taxpayers' payroll, taxpayers who did not choose this monarch, not legitimate.
Moreover, there's just something wrong about having a-class citizens in the form of royal families.
This fixates the class system, and ugly relic from less enlightened times.
For all these reasons, please propose."
"We should abandon coal mining.
Three main areas of clash, first on why it is abusive to the individual.
First, recognize that coal mining is an incredibly dangerous job.
It is physically so in that there's falling rock and debris, there're often gas leaks that can like literally kill you while you are in the mine, long-term exposure to coal dust and coal mining can create long-term conditions like lung cancer and other diseases.
Essentially, this is something that really messes people up into the long term and it is much more dangerous than the vast majority of other jobs, but it is also incredibly unstable.
Mines are regionally based and often take up areas the like the entire area's resources but once they're used up, there's nothing left.
So, the mine will take up and leave, but the area that has become economically dependent on the existence of that mine is left behind.
This is why you end up with things like mine like entire mine towns that later went incredibly like that essentially just went bust after the coal mining ran out in that area, because every single business had been tailored to the existence of that mine and they couldn't sustain themselves without it, and millions and, not millions, but and tens and tens of people went unemployed once that mine moved somewhere else.
It's also just unstable on a personal level.
If you devote your entire life to a mine but it goes away once you're like forty or fifty, you're still not eligible for something like social security, but you're probably no longer capable of doing something like obtaining an education and working somewhere else.
We also just think this isn't a job that people meaningfully consent into.
It is something that purposefully targets individuals who are poor, people who are uneducated, people who are struggling, people who essentially cannot find a job somewhere else.
And we don't think that a lack of alternative can ever allow consent.
For example, if someone puts a gun to my head and threatens me into doing something, we would consider that to be a lack of alternatives in the same way that the fact that I might starve if I don't take this job would force me into that job, but we wouldn't consider that to be consensual actions on my part.
Our second area of clash is about why it's bad for the environment.
First, the process of coal mining itself is incredibly problematic.
It leaks into groundwater and surrounding land.
It the operation of large machinery releases large amounts of fossil fuels which pollute the area.
It literally leaves holes in the ground that can sink entire towns, once it's left behind and if those towns stick around for long enough, and if a fire ever ever starts in a mine, it will go on for so long, producing so many byproducts and toxic gases that the entire area becomes unlivable.
But this doesn't even include what happens when that coal is burned later on.
Because when you burn it for energy, the fossil fuels that are released and the other byproducts are exactly what do things like cause smog over cities and all else.
Our third area of clash is about why these products are just inefficient.
Recognize, first, that the ratio of power to amount of coal is incredibly small.
So, even compared to other fossil fuels like natural gas or oil, coal is always going to be the least productive item, which is a reason that you should at least abandon coal mining for other forms of fuels.
But this gets even worse when you compare it to greener technology and greener energy.
We think it is preferable to start a system in which we start to unseat fossil fuels in general, and the only reason this hasn't happened is massively because there are lobbyists who can say, "" we don't care if it's inefficient.
Here's a bunch of money to keep you from thinking about that politician making making decisions about our future. ""
And other corporations just don't have the same kind of institutional knowledge or the amount of money necessary to unseat those.
But if we were to abandon coal mining as an industry, there wouldn't be anything left for them to advocate for and that money would no longer talk as loud.
This would allow greener energy to line up and become more more mainstream which is something that we always will prefer, because it's going to be more efficient and it's going to have less toxic byproducts.
Proud to propose."
"We should introduce universal health care.
So by this we mean to say that every country around the world should guarantee that all of their citizens have access to basic health care.
So, this might look like the national health service in england or it might look like an expanded version of obamacare, where private insurers but offer everyone insurance similar to the status quo in the US but more extensive.
We're okay with any policy that ultimately ensures that everyone in your country can go to the doctor, can fill prescriptions, and can receive emergency care.
Three reasons why.
First: we tell you that access to healthcare is a human right.
Why is this so?
Well, the first reason, if we think about rights that arise by convention or agreement, is that UN member states have all agreed that there is a right to healthcare.
We see that many UN member states offered charity and aid to other countries to guarantee that those countries' citizens have access to health care, because it's recognized as a fundamental human right.
But it's also a facilitative right we tell you.
Most every country in the world guarantees people some rights: the right to work, the right to vote, the right to speech, to practice a religion, and all of these things are contingent on access to healthcare.
People who are dying because they lack access to pharmaceutical drugs and the like can't access other political rights.
So we tell you that we need to introduce universal health care in order to uphold people's other rights which are more explicitly granted by their nation's constitutions.
At that point, we see that this is both a right by convention and a facilitative right, so it's clear that we should introduce universal health care in every country.
Our second argument is actually that universal health care will save nations money in the long term.
Let's think about what happened in america back before obamacare.
Many people would get sick and not go see the doctor because they didn't have access to health care.
Then, they would go to the emergency room where the law requires doctors to treat them.
So someone who started out with a case of pneumonia that it would have cost fifty euros to treat with antibiotics, now goes to the hospital and consumes thousands of dollars of health care, because they need their lungs drained and they need intensive medical treatment that lasts for days.
So we see that ultimately we would have saved a lot of money by offering this person a a primary care physician or a family doctor, depending on what they call them in different countries, rather than having them turn to emergency services.
But what's more, we also see many people go bankrupt in the US and some other countries although, fortunately, few of them, because of a lack of access to healthcare.
People, for instance, who can't go to the doctor, go to the emergency room, run up enormous bills, and then declare bankruptcy.
Which means that the hospitals lose money, and ultimately those hospitals have their debts written off by local or state governments because, let's face it, hospitals have to be funded somehow.
So, ultimately, we think everyone would save money, and this would help both individual citizens and also hospitals and municipal governments by offering health care.
Our third and final point is about economic growth.
So, I'll talk about first developed, then developing, countries.
In a developed country, like the united states, we think that the economy would grow and be more stable if more people were employed in the health care sector.
Ultimately, increasing access to health care will also increase demand for healthcare, which will lead to a health care boom.
In developing countries, we tell you that a major problem is that many people are unable to find work because of illnesses that are easily preventable.
Many people in nepal, for instance, have cataracts and eye disease that causes you to go blind.
This is easily treatable but ultimately, people without health care can't access that.
So they're not able to work.
They become a drain on their community.
But with basic access to health care, these people would be able to work once more and to contribute to their community.
So, ultimately, for these reasons, we should introduce universal healthcare.
Thank you."
"The palestinian right of return is justified.
So, what the right of return entails is that, palestinians who were forced out of their homeland, by the british, and other colonial powers, and the establishment of the israeli state, should have the ability to return to the land that they had taken from them, should have the ability to return to the israeli state as full citizens, or should otherwise, if they choose not to return to, or are physically incapable of returning, they should be compensated justly for the land that was taken from them, proportionate to the value of that land, as it would accrued in the status quo.
So, a couple of arguments as to why the right of return is justified.
We would say that, the taking of this land in its very nature was unjust.
We recognize that, both both palestinians and jews have a claim to that land as their homeland, and that both have claims of having that land taken from them in the past, but we would say that proximity is important, when differentiating between these claims.
Recognize that palestinians had this land for a more recent time, and had this had this land for an extended period of time, developed roots and cultural attachments to that land, and established communities within that land.
All these things allowed them to, in the present time in which the land was taken from them, form meaningful connections with the land that they had, and with the communities that exist in this land.
When the british power broke apart this land, they broke apart this community, and they gave palestine to the israelis, to the it ensured that this group would be able to return, but simply at the cost of the culture, and the people that existed there in the status quo, and while both people have a claim to this land, in creating a harm that and harm upon palestinians, that were forced out of this area, your again creating the same harm, replicating the harm that was placed upon the jews, and there's no way to deal with this, if you're going to allow the establishment of a jewish state, in which these palestinians can be marginalized, which is what happens in the status quo.
Given that this was an imperialist taking of land, that had no consent from the people that existed there, and reproduce the harm that the creation of this land, or the creation of the israeli state was meant was meant to solve for, we think that the taking of the land is not only harmful and unjustified, but also hypocritical.
So we think that, this also had dramatic and detrimental harms on the palestinian people.
It pushed a government into this area that didn't care for the palestinians, in the same way that it cared for new people entering that land.
It didn't provide them with the same equal protections, that they otherwise would have been able to do, and it didn't justly compensate them for this land, which means that people who, otherwise, accrued wealth, and value, and the property that they had there and other types of things, were forcibly removed from these areas, and weren't able to receive that same value.
So, everything that they developed in this time, everything they developed in connection with the land, was taken from them.
Given that this is the case, we think at the very least, these people deserve compensation for that, even in the society in which these people cannot re-enter physically, we think they're certainly justified in the claim to have compensation, but furthermore we think that you need to have a fair meeting point, that given that both sides have a claim to this land, and that both sides have ties to this land, that are valuable both to them and to the world, we think that it's crucial that you come to some sort of fair a fair resolution, that gives recompense to both parties.
What we think this has to entail is the ability for people to return to their homeland, to return to the place that they have deep cultural connections, deep roots with these areas, and to allow them to live there in peace, and coincide with each other.
We don't think that it's impossible for jews and palestinians to co-exist.
We don't think it's impossible for these groups to get along peacefully, and we don't think it dilutes the experience of jews, living in this area, to have neighbors that are palestinians, that may not share the same cultural value, given that both both sides of this conflict would be able to extract their value from this land, were palestinians allowed to return.
Given that, the taking of the land in the first place was unjust, and doing so cost massive harms and ramifications for palestinians, we would say that the palestinian right of return is justified."
"Same-sex marriage brings more good than harm.
Not allowing a couple of consensual adults to marry each other because other people disapprove of their relationship is the definition of absurd.
The state has no business in telling me who I should live with.
The ban on gay marriage isn't only discriminative to same-sex couples, it also humiliates them and refuses them the very basic dignity of acknowledging that their love is equal to that of any other couple.
Two arguments in this speech: firstly, on discrimination by humiliation and secondly, on like what about religious people's feelings?
First argument: I have no intention to speak of whether marriage is a basic right or not.
As far as I care, the state can say that as of today, no one gets married.
But it seems fairly simple that if some people are allowed to marry, then everyone should be able to do so.
Personally, I do not see any supreme importance in this institution.
I think that it's just a symbolic thing.
The point is that the moment that this custom is adopted and even somewhat glorified by society, then it doesn't matter anymore.
The fact that society awards this ritual with so much meaning and like is what gives it its meaning, because all of us want to feel a part of society.
All of us want to go through the same rituals that everybody else goes through so that we feel we belong.
By denying a certain group this ceremony, the message they are getting is: you guys are not a part of us, you're not like us, you're unwelcome.
Just like so many other cases of discrimination, it's not about the thing itself that's being denied, but rather about the feeling that this denial creates.
Think of a business that refuses to serve african americans, for example.
There are a million other places that these people can go to, right?
But the problem isn't that we've denied them this particular service, but that we've treated them as less deserving.
This is what's so bad about discrimination, and this is also why when opposes to gay marriage innocently offer all kinds of alternatives that give it a different name, like civil partnership or whatever.
We say, "" you know what, you can shove it. ""
Excuse my french.
That's just like like the separate but equal policy.
Separate isn't equal, and until we give it the exact same name, then this will continue to be used as a tool to distinguish between what's considered normal and what isn't, and this is unacceptable to us.
Second argument: the main source of opposition to gay marriage has always been religion.
Now, there are those who claim that this isn't god's intention and blah blah.
I'm not honoring that with a reponse.
What I will do, though, is answer what I believe to be the strongest argument in regard to religion and that is that marriage is essentially a religious institution that requires , you know, registers that are often religious people and therefore, it's unfair to demand that they perform ceremonies or sign papers contrary to their religious , you know, beliefs or conscience.
So, in short, let's call it the kim davis example, you know, after the famous clerk from kentucky.
Our answer is twofold.
A: we believe this is a simple that can easily be solved by saying that every public servant that can't fulfill his job according to the law and refuses to operate in an indiscriminatory fashion should just resign and remove himself in favor of someone who will.
But but second answer, and that's the deeper answer that addresses also the balance between religious feelings and same-sex couples, we say we say the following: whenever there is a clash between two different lifestyles, or rather two groups that have the same set of beliefs that can't coexist, you know, where you can't please one group without harming the other, we should always prioritize the group that's not denying the other group.
To put it in kindergarten terms, we ought prioritize whoever didn't start it.
Same-sex couples ask for no trouble.
They're not trying to tell religious people how to lead their lives or that they shouldn't be religious.
They just want to be treated equally.
As far as they're concerned, everyone could have gotten along perfectly but sadly, they do not get symmetric treatment from the religious community that that to begin with, say that the problem is with the gays' lifestyles and they should change or be discriminated.
This is not a legitimate belief belief.
This is bullying and we should we should not be considerate towards it.
For all of these, please propose."
"We should legalize same sex marriage.
So I'm going to argue that countries around the world which had the rule of law and which generally protect people's rights should allow people to marry those of the same sex in the same way that they allow people to marry those of the opposite sex.
We don't think that domestic partnership programs like what they have in germany right now are sufficient.
We think that it needs to be an equal form of marriage with what people who are marrying someone of the opposite sex have access to.
With that in mind, three arguments for our side.
The first is about equality under the law.
Right now, in germany for instance, if you happen to be attracted to the same sex you don't have equal protection under the law as someone who is attracted to the opposite sex.
They are allowed to marry whoever they want and whoever they love and you are not.
We think that fundamentally because the law in germany as well as in other liberal countries around the world is predicated on the idea that all citizens are equal citizens that this is fundamentally unfair.
You cannot claim to have equality under the law if some people are able to enter into a contract and other people are not.
In particular, we think this is egregious because sexual orientation is an intrinsic characteristic.
Research and the experience of millions of people around the world tells us that people don't choose who they are attracted to, but rather this is something that is intrinsic to us.
This is similar to the way that we don't choose our sex or our race so we ought not be discriminated against on those terms.
We're, broadly speaking, fine with limiting people's rights based on things like age which change over time, but not based on things like sex or race.
We think that sexual orientation is more like the latter than the former and therefore that we ought guarantee equality under the law for people regardless of their sexual orientation.
And this would necessitate allowing people to marry whoever they want or whoever they love regardless of that person's sex.
Our second argument is about the legal benefits to same sex couples.
In america, I know, you're only allowed to visit someone in the hospital if you're a close relative.
So brother, sister, son, father, husband or wife.
So before gay marriage was passed here many times you would have a person's long term partner, someone they had been with for thirty years, who wasn't able to go visit them in the hospital because they technically weren't a close relative.
This is just one example of the types of legal discrimination that gay people face if they aren't able to marry.
We see that because the law privileges marriage over other types of relationship through things like legal privileges and tax status, that we have to allow these benefits to accrue to people attracted to the same sex as well as those who are attracted to the opposite sex.
Otherwise legal discrimination against those groups percolates through every layer of society, which we think is fundamentally unacceptable, especially in liberal countries like germany.
Our third and final argument is that it is good for your country or your area in the long term to legalize same sex marriage.
We see that many areas in the united states which legalized same sex marriage early on and which gained a reputation for being tolerant, saw an influx of highly talented workers.
Many people move to cities like boston, where which was the first major american city that had gay marriage, because they saw that it was somewhere that was more accepting of their lifestyle.
Where people were more likely to treat them as equals than other parts of the country where they were denied access to certain legal protections and the right to marry.
In the same way areas like san francisco that have historically been associated with tolerance for homosexuals have also seen that people move there because of this tolerance.
So it becomes a pull factor that brings in qualified hardworking people from around your country or around the globe even if you legalize same sex marriage.
So this ultimately is beneficial to the whole community, not just the people who want to have these types of marriage.
For these reasons we should legalize same sex marriage.
Thank you."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should ban male infant circumcision.
Three independent points.
The first is just the health harms that are intrinsic to this procedure.
I think that plays out in two ways.
First is during the procedure, there's a high likelihood for you know a botched surgery in a way that you know really has a harmful effect on the kid just in the moment.
I think when compared to other types of surgery, this both is you know very high-risk in terms of you know the likelihood of damaging an organ that's you know pretty pretty vital to the kid's survival.
But secondly is really you know low-reward.
This isn't something you you know triple-bypass heart surgery is high risk of course but we're willing to engage in it because there's a really vital purpose to doing this.
I think with circumcision you're talking about a purpose that's a lot less vital.
This isn't something that you know necessarily the trade-off is so crystal clear that it is worth you know subjecting the child to such an extreme risk.
But beyond the things that can happen just during the procedure, there's long-term harms too you know post-circumcision children are a lot more susceptible to infection, are a lot more susceptible to you know all sorts of problems that are intrinsic that you know having a part of your body removed and particularly having a part of your body removed that is located in an area that gets a high amount of blood flow.
This is you know something that's medically dangerous and you're putting the child through a significant amount of medical risk for an unclear return.
Our second independent point is that this is a industry or at least a procedure that's very tough to regulate.
This generally doesn't happen in hospitals, this is something that often happens you know in in much less professional settings because it's so associated with religious tradition and as a result because it has you know those religious undertones, there's a lot more aversion to you know subjecting this the same you know rigorous regulation that is applied to you know the standard medical fields and standard medical procedures.
So we think generally speaking, the opposition to this argument is always going to come out of the argument that oh well you know if it continues to happen on the black market it'll be impossible to regulate.
I think the problem with that though is that the regulation in the status quo is quite thin and the comparative value therefore you know the the risk we're talking about in terms of you know regulation harms is quite minimal because I don't think that's happening in the status quo.
Our third independent point and I think this is really the most important thing that you want to talk about here is the inability of the child, that is the recipient of the procedure, to actually provide meaningful consent.
So when we talk about medical procedures, I think we quite often think of this as you know there is a certain level of risk involved in the procedure but we allow you know individuals to make decisions based on you know their capacity to reason their way through the thinking and say you know what my you know breast enhancement surgery you know has a certain level of risk associated with it but it's worth the return to me so I'll go forward with it.
With parents or with small children rather, we allow parents to make these decisions for them and I think largely the reason we do that is because most of the procedures when you're so young are things that are you know pretty obviously beneficial you know whether or not you get vaccinated for example you clearly this is something that you want the child to go through because it's something that is very important to ensuring their long term health.
With circumcision however again this this reward is a lot less clear and I think at that point we're a lot less likely letting the parent proxy-out the decision for them for the child that is because the returns are less clear.
I think this is something that at its core is quite debatable but the kid doesn't get to make the decision here you know by virtue of being an infant so it therefore doesn't seem to make that much sense to allow the parent to make this unclear decision on behalf of somebody else.
Even if they're the best proxy for the kids will, I think the better solution is just to you know stay the course and not do anything at all.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should protect whistleblowers.
The model for this is essentially we would make it not allowed for a government to subpoena either a journal or magazine to release the name of a source if they are given information and it prevents you from subpoenaing a like whistleblower into court.
Three main areas of clash.
First on preventing harmful whistleblowing because even when whistleblowing is necessary, it still includes a lot of incredibly sensitive information.
There are safe versus unsafe ways to whistleblow and we think that one of the ways in which you are going to be more safe is one in which you're actually releasing your information to a reputable source such as the new york times or like some kind of good magazine or journal, in which case it will hopefully comb the files for information and redact any names of foreign operatives or any like specific ongoing missions versus is the worst way in which you either like data dump this on wikileaks or something like the dark-web like at best you're giving it to huffpost.
You're basically creating a world in which whatever news source to using is much more likely to remain anonymous but is also much more likely to use your information in an unsafe way and provide it for people who would use it in bad ways.
And recognize that whistleblowers are much more likely to use the good method if the law protects them because then they won't be afraid of say the new york times journalist releasing the source and releasing their names to the to the government.
Because if the law forces journalists to give up whistleblowers those whistle blowers still want to provide the information somewhere right like they still feel passionate about informing the public.
They just choose a method that is much more dangerous and you end up in situations such as soon after the edward snowden problem where the edward snowden whistleblowing incident where actual operatives got killed afterwards because of the names that he dropped and like allowed foreign officials to get a hold of.
Our second area of clash is about why it whistleblowing is a necessary requirement as a check on the government because there are lots of government departments that aren't particularly subject to public oversight.
Groups like the NSA or the CIA can get away with being incredibly rights violative without anyone in the public knowing and we think we have a really good example of this having already happened in the situation with edward snowden where was revealed to us that the NSA was currently monitoring everyone's phone calls an illegal manner and there was no way the public could get a hold of this because this was all considered secure information but just because something is secure information doesn't make it less of a violation.
We need people to be willing to inform the public when things get especially bad and we think that they're going to be much more likely to inform the public if they're being protected by the government and they don't have to worry about getting in trouble or losing their jobs or having to move to russia as a result of what they did.
So we also just think that a lot of the time it is in the incentive of the government to crackdown especially hard on people like this and so as such because they are going up there are likely to be targeted in an unequal and unfair manner, we think they especially deserve protection to prevent that kind of abuse from happening.
Our third area of clash is why it's good for public government accountability because when the government isn't afraid of whistleblowing, they're much more likely to take more unethical unethical actions because they know that they're getting away with it and they have a selfish incentive in which they want to either be able to make the most money or gather the most information or be as secure in themselves as possible and so they're much more likely to actually act in ways such as taping all of our conversations or placing cameras into places we don't want them to place them.
If the government is however afraid of a whistleblower coming out, they're much less likely to do that because the cost of being caught and the public opinion that will be affected is much more important to them than the concept of having this people's data or doing that illegal thing.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should adopt socialism.
Generally speaking we're going to define this as forms of government that institute like large amounts of taxation in order to fund like social welfare programs.
More broadly we just define this as redistribution of wealth, so we take from the rich and give to the poor and there are many means of doing this, we would endorse all of them.
Three independent points.
First socialism decreases inequality.
I think the reason why this is true is fairly intuitive that when you engage in redistributive policies you just like have a more equal society because you are taking resources away from the people that have lots of them and giving to the people that don't have a lot of them thus bringing everyone towards the center.
Four reasons why decreasing inequality is really important.
First is just fairness.
We think that generally speaking the people who are super rich in this world did so through very little of their own work.
A lot of them inherited their wealth, a lot of them got lucky, a lot of them have just have like some sort of other privilege that isn't class related like say race or gender that allowed them to get that wealth.
Generally speaking we don't think people earn the wealth they get so we're were we're willing to like inflict on the rights of like the small minority that did earn their wealth in order to make up for the vast majority of people that didn't earn their poverty.
Secondly you there is decreasing marginal utility of capital and resources.
So a hundred dollars is worth a lot more to somebody that only has a hundred dollars in the first place than it is to someone who's like a multi-trillionaire or whatever.
This is because that person with not much money already doesn't have much so not only did they see greater value in the things that they don't currently have but also the things that they would be buying with their like new money are much more fundamental to their rights.
So the super rich person sees a hundred dollars and they're like oh I'll just like get that to some charity or whatever at the most generous level.
At the worst level they're like oh well I'll buy like a really fancy cup holder for my maserati whereas the really poor person is like ih I'm gonna buy food because that's something that I generally don't get to do.
We think that disparity and how much the thing that you are getting with that money the value that it holds is something that justifies redistributive capital.
Third there's less conflict in a world with more equity.
Most global conflict over the years has been class based.
Wars between the haves and the have-nots.
Walk through the historical record but typically it is because somebody has something and somebody doesn't have something and the people that don't have it are like I want that and then there's a war over it.
So I think when you how more equity amongst people there's less conflict.
Fourth is just decrease suffering.
I think this ties back largely to the marginal utility argumentation I've made but just generally speaking suffering is exponentially worse for the poor than it is for the rich.
Given that we think we mitigate net suffering by redistributing capital to the people who need it the most.
Our second independent point is just democratic.
Look like when you have more like even resources and when you have a more even say in your society and you have communal ownership there's always going to be like more equitable voices.
We think that no individual's voice or opinion is more inherently important than another's and at that point we are willing to defend a system that strives to have equity in like participation within like the democratic system.
Like people can't just like use their money as a tool to like drown out the voices of the poor and like elections for example on our side of the house.
Our third independent point is that private property is a myth.
So all property is largely a product of other people's labor.
Like your watch even if you paid for it is a product of the labor of like some poor person in like a developing country that had to put that watch together.
We think that's unjust because generally speaking the fact that you had a couple extra bucks lying around to buy the thing doesn't justify your ownership of it when other people put more labor and put more value into that item.
Given that we think the communal ownership of objects makes more sense.
Communal ownership of like property and like land and things like that also makes more sense.
So we think of the socialist society that redistributes these items and has social like communal ownership through the state of these objects it's just inherently more logical.
Proud to propose."
"We should prohibit slum tourism.
Slum tourism is basically when wealthy people visit a very low-income or downtrodden area in order to see what it's like there, to see the people who live there and things like that.
So this might look like american tourists visiting brazil and going into the favelas, for instance.
So with this in mind, we think that the countries where the slum tourism takes place should ban this practice.
So in our example, it would be brazil banning it, not the united states.
A few reasons why we think that this should be true: first, slum tourism is degrading to the people who live in these slums.
Realize that the people who live there don't do so by choice.
Most of these people came to the city for work or were misled about the economic opportunities they would have there, or their family has been there for a long time so they're forced to live in these conditions.
We think that it's unfair to put these people on display like zoo animals given that this is their home, given that they don't want to be in these conditions.
Ultimately, we think that it is denying these people their human dignity to allow slum tourism.
When you have people coming in to gawk, people coming in and taking photos on cameras that cost more than the people who live there make in a year, we think that this is ultimately demeaning to them.
Rather than offering help to these people, we're instead spending money on making them an object of entertainment for the international elite.
We think that, in particular, this actually undermines any sort of empathy for these people.
Recognize that the rich and powerful who are visiting don't go home and do anything to help them or at least they haven't in the past.
Instead, they go home and put their pictures on instagram and maybe take a picture of themselves giving a dollar to some needy child.
It lets these people feel good without actually increasing the amount of empathy that they feel for those living in these conditions.
If anything, it undermines sympathy, because it makes them feel like they can leave and the problem goes away.
We've often heard that the poor are a problem which is out of sight and out of mind.
But even if you go and visit for a short period of time, being able to leave undermines your ability to think about this as a permanent solution because to you, it's a temporary thing completely.
At this point, we think it's clear that government should ban slum tourism to protect the dignity of the people who live there and because it undermines the ability of people to have empathy for those who are worse off.
But secondly, we think that slum tourism should be prohibited because it harms the traditional tourist industry.
Think about what you do when you go to a slum tour.
You go you go, probably on a bus or with a guide, into a unsafe neighborhood.
You don't spend money at restaurants there, you're not staying in that area.
Ultimately, we think it's very likely that you don't participate in the traditional tourist economy, where people visit and spend lots of money on food and housing and things like that.
We think that if you prohibited slum tourism, that if people still wanted to visit these areas, they would have to partake in more traditional tourism.
So they would be staying in hotels in the area, they would be eating food in the area.
Now perhaps fewer people would do this, but at the point where more money on net is coming into the local economy, we still think that this is a good thing.
Aside from that, even if people choose to go to other areas instead, we think that they'll probably spend more money overall, because rather than paying tour or tour companies from their home country to set this up for them, they're going to be spending money at the beaches in brazil and things like that.
Lastly, we think that slum tourism is unsafe and and ultimately, has burdens for the state in that respect.
If you recall, there was tremendous concern about the brazil olympics because people were worried that the athletes would be mugged.
As a result, there was a huge amount of spending on police and gendarmes and other paramilitary groups to protect the olympic athletes.
We see something similar in place to protect tourists in these impoverished areas.
We think that this is a poor use of funds that could go to actually helping people and policing their communities rather than spending public funds to protect rich tourists.
So for these reasons, we should prohibit slum tourism.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should cancel the patriot act.
We mean by this is that we would prefer it if lawmakers immediately took action against the patriot act and so, from now on, it would not exist as well as the rules that it has in place.
Three main areas of clash: first, on why it is an unjust passing.
Recognize that in if we show you that, in the first place, this patriot act should never have passed, it ought necessarily be repealed now.
Recognize that in democracy, policy needs to be consensual, because democracy is based on consent of the government and if you don't have consent of the governed, then it necessarily means that you are oppressive and not operating in a way that is legitimate.
And in order to have the consent of the governed, it's not enough just like exist as like a theoretically consensual western liberal democracy, rather that consent and that desire has to be reflected in the in like public policy.
And like and this is true not just for like just general democratic reasons, but also because the political will of the people who are governed needs to be reflected insofar as they are most affected by it.
Insofar as this is true, any policy passed without consent is illegal and oppressive.
Consent requires two things.
First, it requires alternatives.
This is true because only with alternatives are we able to avoid coercion.
If I'm told that my mother is going to die unless I do this one thing and if I do nothing, then she will pass, then necessarily I'm going to do that one thing because I don't see there being a viable alternative.
This would be the truth even if what I'm going to do is something incredibly bad and problematic, like stealing something or going against my own moral claims.
We think people would still often make that decision because the alternative is something much worse.
This is coercive and nonconsensual, though, because in a world in which I had full freedom, I wouldn't do it.
But second, we think that emotional stability is also incredibly important insofar as this is the the reason that we don't think consent is required when someone is really drunk, or even when someone is like not necessarily like like enthusiastically consenting, because in order to have consent, you have to establish rationality, because that's the only world in which you know that that person truly wants what is happening.
But recognize that the patriot act was passed right after nine eleven.
People were terrified.
This means that they weren't emotionally stable.
They were just trying to find a way to feel safe in a moment where they couldn't figure out how.
But also, recognize that it also they were also told this was the only thing they could do in order to prevent terrorism.
Thus, there were no alternatives in their mind, because the government necessarily posed it as if if we don't pass this act, terrorists will overrun our country, and the united states will cease to exist.
This necessarily made this act coercive, which means it would never should never happened.
We think we're fine with a world in which we like cancel the patriot act now and recreate all the votes, and if like all the people still want it, we would allow it to pass.
But we still think that it needs to go through that kind of check before we can accept it.
Our second area of clash is about how it's rights violative.
First recognize that it allows the government to spy on its citizens, thus violating the right to privacy and other like consent frameworks we think are important.
This is something that the government should never legislate in a way that they allow themselves to do it, and like necessarily ought not exist in a democratic society in which people should have their full and free rights in order to self-actualize and exist in a way that they feel safe.
But also, recognize that it does an incredibly problematic thing as well in that it it lets the government obstruct obstruct the rights of the accused by hiding evidence.
Because part of the patriot acts act says that if the government has evidence that they think like leads them to a terrorist organization, they don't have to show it in court, but that person can still be like indicted based on it.
This constitutionally violates the right to a fair trial insofar as it creates an imbalance between the government and anyone who's trying to defend the convicted, because the government can just say, "" but look, this is really compelling like evidence, we just can't show it to you, "" on the grounds of national security.
Insofar as this is unconstitutional and has bad pragmatic outcomes, proud to propose."
"The vow of celibacy should be abandoned.
So by this we mean that the catholic church, which for centuries now has required that priests be celibate, should give up this requirement.
So priests ought be allowed to marry and have sexual intercourse, the same as any other married adult in the catholic faith.
We don't want this debate to be about the theological implications of the vow of celibacy.
We're just going to say that orthodox priests and protestant priests and even certain rights of catholicism, aside from roman catholicism, these or christian groups allow their priests to marry, so we see that clearly there is some religious ground for this practice to be allowed.
But with that aside, we want to get into two major arguments of this debate that we think will be more accessible.
The first is that the vow of celibacy dissuades young men from joining the priesthood.
So we see that because of the vow of celibacy, many young men who might be deeply religious, who might be very attracted to life in the church, are likely to turn to secular occupations instead.
Indeed, this is one of the reasons why we think there may originally had been a vow of celibacy was to sort of weed out those of lesser faith.
But we think that a result of this is that many of the most qualified candidates will choose not to join the church.
Imagine that you had a hundred young men in the city of boston every year who are interested in becoming priests, and fifty of them are, you know, intelligent, driven young men who you would want to become priests, but only twenty five out of the total group are willing to take this vow of celibacy.
Half who are the kind of competent people that we want and half who are incompetent.
We see that if you have a certain demand for, say, thirty priests that year, that you will have to take some of the incompetent men, whereas if you got rid of this requirement, you would only take the confident young men.
We think that although obviously these numbers are made up, you can see that you're more likely to get incompetent priests as a result of the vow of celibacy, and you're likely to have young men who could otherwise have served the church in a very fruitful, useful and personally fulfilling way, turn to other occupations in its stead.
We think that the church suffers when there is comparatively poor leadership.
That you would be able to reach out to more people through evangelism, that you would be able to better care for current members of your parish, that you would be able to fill positions which have gone empty, there are many parishes around the world which don't have a priest because there's a shortage of capable priests.
We think that all of these harms could be avoided by simply removing the vow of celibacy.
Our second argument is about how we think that this is a law made to be broken.
What do we mean by this?
We think that it's very difficult for any young person, most people become a priest when they're fairly young, to really weigh what this means over the course of their lifetime.
You know, a young person who is a virgin may not fully understand the implications of what they are signing up for when they choose to take this vow of celibacy, which means that it's quite likely that they'll eventually break their vow.
We think that this has several major harms.
One, is that it means that people who were doing a pretty good job as a priest otherwise will be removed from their parish and sent off to be isolated from the public, because that's generally what happens when priests break their vows, which means that they won't be helping people, they won't be reaching out to those who need them, their talents will go to waste.
And on top of that, that optically it makes the church look hypocritical if priests are violating their vows.
So we think that this will turn many people, especially young people, away from the church, because they think that the leadership of the church is not living up to the same standards that ordinary people are expected to in terms of maintaining vows.
So ultimately we think that because this is such a difficult vow to keep, it has many harms to the church in terms of its personnel and its public perception.
So for these reasons, the vow of celibacy ought to be abandoned.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should prohibit unisex bathrooms.
Important thing to know, we think that you can still have single occupancy bathrooms that anyone can use of any gender, you just can't have multiple toilet bathrooms that are labeled unisex rather than labeled male and female in terms of sex, which is I think like the status quo essentially, where you can have like both gender or like all genders, both sexes, like single occupancy bathrooms that can lock like have a door and lock, but you but most institutions don't really have like large multi-stall bathrooms that are unisex.
Two main areas of clash, first I'm creating safe spaces.
Recognize that there are very few places in public where someone, but especially women, can get away from the opposite gender.
The majority of the world is unisex and specifically male dominated, and we think that it's really important for women to know that there is somewhere to go when they are uncomfortable or exhausted.
We think that this makes it that having these two separate bathrooms makes it really easy for female friends to check in on others if there's harassment or some emotional issue.
Like we think the example of women going to the bathroom together illustrates this idea that a lot of the time women need to be able to get to a space where they can either communicate about the situation in private without anyone else listening, or where they're able to just be like hi, I am here for you, if you are in an uncomfortable situation of any sort.
Like we think the stereotype exists for a reason, but it's not because women are weird or finicky as men like to believe, rather it's because women are faced with a myriad of incredibly dangerous personal obstacles in their everyday life, and the way in which they cope with it is by creating solidarity with other women, and going to spaces wherein men cannot reach them.
And we think that that's currently something that bathrooms provide, they stop providing when they become unisex.
The other issue here is that we think that if you've had past traumatic experiences, like people who are survivors of either physical or sexual abuse can genuinely feel incredibly uncomfortable performing actions that are so private, such as using the bathroom, around people of the opposite gender, or like hearing them can be really problematic.
We believe that there's a reason that a lot of bathrooms will have the like will have the advertisements for like specific helplines up on the walls, or like a lot of like safe space rhetoric goes around goes on around them.
Because we think that it's really hard for survivors already to find spaces they can rely on within like general society, and we think that what the bathroom does is it provides somewhere where you can go reliably and know that no one is going to be able to follow you, if suddenly you feel really trapped or if you like someone is coming after you, that's somewhere where there's like a social stigma against it occurring, then you feel more safe reaching out.
Even if it's just like a phone call to the number that's on the wall or something like that, and we think that it's actually incredibly important.
Our second area of clash is about about efficiency.
Recognize that there are like just like having bathroom split based on sex is just a more efficient way to have bathrooms in the first place.
We think that first we actually want to discuss urinals really briefly.
First they are more cost, speed, and eco-friendly, but it only ever makes sense to have urinals in all-male bathrooms because it's not something that a woman could ever be able to use, given a lack of or like a woman by sex, not necessarily by gender, would even be able to use due to lack of penis.
And since that's not an efficient use of space in a unisex bathroom, that's not something we'd ever see.
But like women's bathrooms already constantly have longer lines than male equivalents, so we think that adding men to that equation doesn't actually help the situation in any way.
We think that what happens on their side of the house is that unisex bathrooms are just an excuse for new buildings not to include two sets of bathrooms, rather they can just have one and use half of the space and half of the money and they say oh look, it's unisex so it's fine.
And we think that insofar as it's always preferable to have large amounts of quantity even if it's not the most politically liberal kind of thing, then we prefer that world.
Proud to propose."
"We should abandon democracy.
So, obviously, if we're going to abandon democracy, we need to propose an alternative.
So here's all our here's our our alternative: we want a technocracy that is governed by a number of bodies that run different functions.
So we're not going to have one centralized government.
We think there are a number of bodies that we can instead have that focus on different sectors, sectors like economic growth, sectors like climate change prevention, sectors like civil rights protection, sectors like legal protections, and we think specialists would be appointed by a body with members of with members from the relevant field.
So we think that if, say, you have a bureau for prevention of climate change, you would have a number of people that fill different executive roles and different administrative roles.
Those people would be appointed by a body of larger climate change experts, people that are most well-versed in the industry, and once you're appointed, you would you would serve one term, probably of something like five years.
You couldn't be renominated, you couldn't be reelected, nothing like that is going to happen.
All right.
Two big things that we're going to talk about.
The first is why majoritarianism is just bad, and that is what democracy fundamentally is.
It's governance by the majority.
There's nothing inherently correct about majority approval.
In fact, many, many times throughout history, the majority accepted things that we today find appalling: things like not allowing women to vote, things like holding individual human beings as slaves, things such as things such as the criminalization of of marijuana.
These are things that the majority of people viewed as acceptable that now, we would say the majority doesn't view as acceptable and has more principled reasons for that to be the case.
This often causes the majoritarianism often causes entrenchment of bad societal norms.
So when you have a majority that is given power and is allowed to fulfill that power, they view might as right, and they view it as a self-reinforcing system.
Slavery was allowed to exist for so long because the people that held power were able to reproduce, become successful, and pass those beliefs on to their to their successors, and they were able to create systems that entrenched old beliefs.
Majority is incentivized always to maintain power structures in order to benefit the current group that's in power.
It's not even safe from tyranny of the few, though.
Even if you think democracy is good because at least the most people are going to benefited, well there's the opposite side of that spectrum, and you can see recent elections in which money has played a huge role, where turnout has been incredibly low, and where a number of laws have been put in place to disenfranchise voters once again.
Democracy does not ensure majoritarianism and even when it does, it does a really bad job of ensuring actual protections for people.
We think that, secondly, specialization and information is crucial to governing.
Governing today should be data-driven.
We can model economic outcomes of policy, we can model impacts on climate change, we have a better understanding of how our society functions in a data-driven, technologically advanced way.
Technocrats are far better positioned to analyze the data that's relevant to their field and evaluate the best outcomes.
Even if you think that the people that are currently elected actually hold the interests of their constituents, they're just not informed enough in the relevant fields to make important decisions on things like climate change or economic policy.
If I'm a career politician that's never had any sort of formal training in economics, except maybe a course or two in college, there's no reason that I'm qualified to make decisions about taxation and economic economic decisions.
And furthermore, if you're a technoocrat, you're not tied to money in the same way as democratic legislators are.
We think a lack of repleted elections finally in terms means that you're less likely to make short-termist decisions.
If you're only holding one term, you're going to make the decision that you think is going to lead to the best outcomes rather than making decisions that might have the best short-term outcomes just to win voters over, while sacrificing long-term gains.
We think that this technocracy is far more likely to breed good governance and for these reasons, we should abandon democracy."
"Assisted suicide should be a criminal offense.
So I wanna be clear what we're talking about.
Assisted suicide is when a doctor or a medical professional facilitates someone ending their own life.
So normally this is going to be someone with a terminal illness and the doctor is going to get them some medication or something that will end their life and give it to them and facilitate their ability to use this if they're having difficulty doing so because they're so close to the end of their life.
We think that there should be a criminal offense for the medical professional, not for the person seeking to end their own life.
Three arguments, the first, is that this is a clear breach of medical ethics.
Doctors in particular are sworn under the hippocratic oath in most countries to do what they can to protect and preserve life and to help people to recover from illness.
Obviously there is a breach of this oath when they are facilitating suicide.
We tell you that doctors are encouraging someone to do something that is actively damaging to their health.
It doesn't matter if this is what the person wants.
I wanna be very clear about that.
Society all the time forces people to get medical treatment that they don't want.
We institutionalize people, we put them in rehabilitation programs.
It's clear that people's medical care is provided by society whether they want it or not.
We think that one reason why this is the case is because people who are ill or addicts or otherwise in a difficult position, aren't capable of making the best decision for themself.
You need someone who is unbiased and not in that type of position to make a decision for them and it should be a doctor, and that doctors should try to administer the kind of help that they need rather than give them this kind of very ultimately damaging procedure.
Our second argument is about perverse incentives.
I think it's unfortunate but money is always a part of healthcare decisions.
In countries like the united states, people are denied care because they're unable to pay.
In countries like britain and canada, services that are available to the very rich aren't available to lower income people because the government health care service can't afford to pay for them.
As an example of this people often wait months at a time for MRI's in europe or in canada which would be available same day in the united states at a much higher price.
So if there's already a perverse incentive for insurance companies to encourage doctors not to offer certain treatments because they're expensive, then I think that there's a horrible perverse incentive to offering to legalize doctors killing a patients.
As an insurance company, why would you ever want to pay out to help someone in terminal care?
This is a person who will never pay premiums again, who will never repay medical debts, and who is costing you a lot of money because end of life care is actually the most expensive type of care in the medical system in the US and I presume other countries as well right now.
So insurance companies now have a huge perverse incentive to not give doctors any alternative other than a physician assisted suicide.
In other words, they will cover physician assisted suicide and no other alternative so that doctors will be forced into this and patients will have their hands forced and we think that is unacceptable, but insurance companies are such a coercive entity that they'll be able to do this and also to lobby and get away with it at a governmental level.
Our last argument is that nobody can make an intelligent decision about death other than to remain alive.
Why is this true?
No one knows what death is like.
I remember at the end of plato's apology when socrates says if death is but a dreamless slumber then I won't be so sorry to have died at all and if death means going down to hades and speaking with the ancients that it won't be such a terrible thing.
But to this day nobody actually knows what happens when you die.
It might be the case that the christians are right and suicide means that you go to hell.
It might be the case that nothing happens at all, but the point is that in the face of a total lack of information, you shouldn't make a very drastic irreversible decision.
Suicide is a permanent solution to what may turn out to be a temporary problem and we don't think it should ever be an option for that reason.
Therefore assisted suicide should be a criminal offense for the doctor.
Thank you."
"We should prohibit pipeline transfers.
Three main arguments, first on the ways in which this endangers the general populace.
Recognize first and foremost and probably most importantly that pipeline transfers are incredibly explosive.
And already whatever benefit we get from efficiency of having pipelines instead of trucks gets erased the moment you recognize how much damage such a long distance explosion can cause.
Because sure, a truck driving on its own carrying all of this oil or gas, or whatever you're transporting, is dangerous.
Because if that truck lights on fire the occupants of that truck will die in that truck will hurt its surroundings.
But it will hurt infinitely less in terms of just sheer surface area than a pipeline that spans millions of miles.
Because these kinds of flames travel along a pipe.
It's like if I lit a fuse on a very long string.
When something happens in one area, that travels the miles and miles.
So we think the problem becomes that the damage incurred by this thing is always going to outweigh the cost that moving things in a manner that is shorter might take.
Especially since recognize that these companies can afford to do that.
Right?
Like they're oftentimes incredibly large oil conglomerates, they've poured like they have the millions to pour into these kinds of pipelines.
We think they also have that money to ensure safe transport in other ways.
We also just think that it's that these kinds of things affect just infinitely more people on a different level as well because it's not just the driver, it's not just the worker, it's the towns that you're running under.
Its the lakes that are involved.
We also in the environmental damage of these things is much larger because when these things rupture up and down you get infinitely more leaks going into the earth than if you just have one truck that breaks down and pours out its load.
And oftentimes these things are built right above the ground water so the process by which your water gets contaminated is just infinitely more likely to happen on their side of the house.
And we think just the risk of this occurring is already bad enough.
Because you can do things like check the cars you are using.
You can also do things like create more efficient cars like you can use the train.
You oftentimes we see, in a lot of rural towns, really long train tracks for this purpose.
You can use a plane.
Like we just don't think this is the best solution.
Our second argument is that it's bad for the environment.
First it requires massive excavation.
In the process of building these kinds of things you have to clear all of the land above it first.
So you're destroying forests, you are taking out like quarries and lakes in the process, and we think this is so much more invasive than just conventional transport.
Because in the status quo you can have a forest with a road through it and trees going on either side.
But in order to install the pipeline in the first place you have to get rid of all of that.
And we think the environment actually matters a lot.
First because it does things like provide fresh oxygen to counteract the pollution that we're constantly pouring into it, but also because we're getting to a point in our society where the environmental damage actually risks harming us in really problematic ways.
It also oftentimes destroys farmland and goes through lower income individuals like housing areas and villages and towns, and we think that's really problematic because it unseats those individuals and creates a world in which we value that oil company more than we value the citizens of the united states.
So we actually think the government has an obligation to step in here to make sure that its citizens are not harmed by this process.
Our third argument is about encouraging greener energy sources.
We think that these kinds of pipelines are primarily used for gas and oil so if you make it more expensive to transport by forcing them to use things like cars and of pipelines and the cost of gas and oil goes up, you're more likely to see companies that are trying to make cheaper alternatives and greener energy forms crop up, and we think that that is good.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish attorney-client privilege.
We mean by this is that we wouldn't have any kind of mandated reporting like we wouldn't require attorneys to give up their clients if they were confessed to but we would provide an option like we wouldn't make attorney-client privilege something that is legally binding so that attorneys could report their clients if they so decide to.
Two main areas of clash, first on fulfilling the purpose of the criminal justice system.
Recognize that at it's heart the criminal justice system is truth seeking.
It wants to make sure that those who are innocent are not punished but those that are guilty are in accordance to the laws of whatever country you're in.
The idea is that guilty deserve punishment because they took away from society its safety they made people afraid they did something that broke the laws and so made the laws less sacred setting a precedent that breaking them is okay all of these reasons are like reasons that we generally think it's bad when guilty people get away.
Attorneys are there to make sure that societal bias and a lack of education doesn't preclude an innocent person from getting in a from getting like the correct call on their case, like it doesn't mean just because I'm not educated enough just because I'm a person of color I go to jail even when I'm innocent.
And there's a problem in the status quo where attorneys have become a way that guilty people go free or get significantly less harsh sentences just because they are able to pay a good lawyer or something like that.
And we think that this is very bad because it basically takes people for who have like committed crimes and pose a threat to society and puts them straight back into the population simply because attorneys were never allowed to say my client is guilty and were forced to defend them regardless of what crimes they had committed.
We need to stop giving criminals an extra shield of protection.
The only group that needs attorney-client privilege are those who are guilty either way so we think that at the point that attorney-client privilege literally only defends those who have committed the crimes they're accused of we think that it shouldn't exist at all.
But our second area of clash is about when attorneys would use this because we think that given the situations in which this gets used it's especially important that it not exist.
So attorneys understand that violating attorney-client privilege even if it's not legally binding is going to lose them clients and money because individuals want to talk to attorneys they can trust there were like they will worry if case like go to going to attorney who has been known to turn people in things like that.
So there's an incentive structure already in place that means this only gets used in the most heinous situation like you found that find out that the person is a serial killer or a slave trader or like has made multiple multiple violations or whatever because every single incentive in terms of like the market tells attorneys not to use this.
So we think we need those cases to get out because releasing those people back into society is dangerous and they're you're way more likely to catch those were like really rich with good lawyers because in the status quo rich people often get off regardless of whether they're guilty or not because they're able to afford really good attorneys and this allows attorneys with a conscious to report even incredibly wealthy perpetrators.
We also think that creating closure here is really really important.
There's a problem in the status quo were even after a person's case is closed double jeopardy isn't a possibility details of of a case don't come out because the perpetrator never releases them and eventhough the lawyer might know them they're not allowed to disclose that.
And this is really bad for like especially in the situations of violent crimes or individuals who are like certain victims were affected it's really bad because those victims never get any kind of closure like we think it's really important for people to find out where the bodies of their dead loved ones are buried or for a lot of people it's like very important to find out in a lot of unsolved cases what actually happened.
We think that there were people who never ever got this kind of closure eventhough they deserved it because of attorney-client privilege and we think that attorneys ought be able to facilitate that kind of healing within society.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"Goal-line technology brings more good than harm.
So, by this we mean things like instant replay, and technology actually at the gold level in fifa matches, and we think that, by do more good than harm, that ultimately this would be good for fifa, and it's good for sport in general.
So we have to arguments for you, the first is about faith and referees.
So, most sports rely very heavily on perceived legitimacy of the officials, like the referees, in order for people to have faith that the outcome of the games aren't rigged or aren't heavily biased.
So if people don't think that the referees are doing their job properly, then they're going to be less invested in the sport.
We think that we solve for this because when you can go back and have a referee reverse the poor call by using instant replay technology, then people know that the referee is actually doing a better job, is more willing to overturn bad calls, and is actually able to make a good call when they're too far away to see something up close.
All of this means that you get more viewers because people will think that the sport is more fair.
One reason why people might stop watching sport or choose not to watch it, is that they think that the matches are rigged, and it's much more difficult to think that matches are rigged if it's demonstrably true that they simply aren't because we have computers that can replay exactly what's happening.
But on top of that, we think referees will be more willing to change calls.
Right now while it's true that referees in fifa and other sports can change a call after it's made, they have little reason to do so because they're not getting more information after they make their original call.
Now we can provide them with more and better information which might reverse bad calls, and reward teams for playing well rather than for having good luck.
So we think that ultimately teams will play better when the incentive is more to focus on winning the game and not gamesmanship and showmanship, as unfortunately is sometimes the case right now.
Think about flopping in basketball as an example of this.
Players pretend to get injured who aren't really getting injured, but with instant replays we can tell if it's legitimate or not and avoid the rest being tricked by gamesmanship.
So our second argument, is about why we think it's harder to rig matches if you have instant replay technology.
So we think that first of all you need accountability to prevent matches from being rigged.
Recognize first of all that when a match is rigged, lots of people have to be involved in this.
Many players, coaches, referees are all involved.
It's very rare that it's only one person who is rigging a match, and in those instances we still think we better check by having instant replay technology.
Because we think that we can prove that someone didn't play their hardest, or that a goalie allowed the ball to go in, or that a referee was calling shots unfairly for a particular team, or that a coach wouldn't make a certain play that needed to be made for his team to win the game.
We think that accountability and rigging matches are really important because so many people invest a lot of money in owning and managing teams, lots of communities, economies are based around the supplying service economy that goes along with the team, so we think that this actually is very important to a lot of communities that sports are fair and that people are going out to watch matches.
We think that you change the decision making process for everyone involved who might be engaged in cheating by having instant replay.
If everyone knows that there's a greater risk that they'll get caught doing the wrong thing, then we think that they won't do the wrong thing as often.
This seems pretty intuitive, that if you know you could lose your cushy job as a ref or as a sports player, that you're ultimately not going to cheat because you would rather keep your job rather than gamble or otherwise break the rules.
But we also think that players will have more faith in one another if everyone is kept honest by this instant replay technology.
I think that it's pretty likely that a lot of players who cheat right now, or officials that cheat right now, do it because they think everyone's doing it and there's a cultural problem where it's impossible to prove that other people aren't taking advantage, and you are worse off than everyone else if you aren't also take advantage.
But with instant replay we can show who was actually being genuine and who isn't, so we think that people will have more faith in other people involved in the sport, and thus that there will be less of an incentive to cheat for that reason.
Lastly we think that punishments will be more fair if it's more apparent what people are actually doing.
Using instant replay is a bit like having DNA evidence in a court trial, instead of just relying on witness testimony.
We think that you can actually be more fair in allocating punishment to players, officials, and anyone else who's involved in cheating.
So for these reasons, we think that goal-line technology brings more good than harm.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should cancel the affordable care act.
Two main areas of clash, first on how it has harms to consumers.
I think the problem, in part, with the affordable care act is that it told consumers that they could keep their old insurance if they wanted but it also caused many many companies to close down and stop providing insurance, because they couldn't meet the list of requirements that was added on with with like the ACA.
It forced a lot of people to have obama care who didn't want it.
The problem with that is that it had a lot of like extra unnecessary services that a lot of people just didn't need.
Obama care is great for individuals who have a lot of like pre existing conditions and who like need maternity care etcetera but it's a really bad for individuals who don't need that stuff and don't want to be paying for it.
The problem of losing your old insurance is the second that you do so it's really difficult to get a new one that isn't obama care, in so far as a lot of your stuff is going to become a pre existing condition and everything becomes more expensive when the last insurance company trusted you and this one doesn't.
So insofar as it like forced individuals to enter into a system they don't consent into, we think that that's bad.
But also, it also put people who were just too poor to have insurance into a really harsh position.
The there was a like a fairly large fine if you didn't have obama care.
But obama care also cost more than the fine for not having it.
So individuals who were really poor and hadn't had insurance under the prior system were now forced to either pay more money than they had for insurance, for ACA, or pay still more money than they than they have, but less than ACA would cost, in order to not have insurance, but just for the fine of not having it.
This really bad it because they're like individuals who already don't have the money for this and probably shouldn't be charged for a service that they aren't going to receive.
I think the problem here is that you need to either completely subsidize those individuals who can't afford it or provide options to not have insurance at all, and I don't think a system that forces people into these circumstances and put them in even more of a disadvantage than society already has them, is one that should stand.
It also caused many employers to stop offering insurance.
They were just willing to like pay the fee that was associated and allow people to find their own.
And the problem here is that a lot of people really appreciated the employee benefits and the fact that they didn't have to pay for something the ACA.
What the ACA did is allowed employers to get away with not providing insurance and forcing individuals who previously had these benefits to have to pay for the ACA or private insurance.
It also raised pharmaceutical prices.
A major portion of the ACA was an eighty four point eight billion like extra fees levied against pharmaceutical companies under like part d of the medicare act.
Flaws, the problem with this is that often flows over into drug prices and the cost is passed on to consumers and that's really bad because a lot of the time individuals need the medications and they oftentimes can't afford what those prices rise to.
Also, there's no incentive for insurances to start covering those higher prices, and if they do that's also a cost that goes over to consumers, because corporations are only going to worry about their bottom line.
So we think that insofar as this like ultimately just ends up being more expensive for individuals that probably shouldn't have to have that, it shouldn't exist.
But our second area of clash is about why it's not socialist enough.
The affordable care act is a bandaid on the gaping wound that is american public health.
Healthcare is a right that states need to provide for.
Its facilitative to something that everyone has recognized both constitutionally and fundamentally as a right to life.
They need to repeal the ACA because a stop cock on all future healthcare legislation.
Liberals can't betray it without looking like there's political fracturing and hypocritical and losing all of their constituents.
Meanwhile, republicans just keep poking at the problems which tarnishes the image of any kind of socialist healthcare system into the long term.
We think that you need to repeal the ACA and then use the momentum of people losing their insurance to pass something even more liberal, and also unite different groups of democrats around it because they recognize that the republicans won't let something so loose pass and they've now seen that it's not something that is completely functional.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"Sex education should be mandatory.
When we're talking about sex education, we want to be quite clear.
When we say sex education, we mean comprehensive sex education, sex education that teaches about both STDs and the different types of contraception that are available to individuals, how to use these types of contraception.
We think it would be a broad type of course taught early in high school, probably for an entire year, and we think that the curriculum itself, as far as specifics, could be set by a panel of doctors and other experts in the field, rather than being set by politicians, we think it should be set by individuals that are most informed, a combination of education and health experts that could work together in forming the curriculum that is most likely to reduce the the amount of unwanted teenage pregnancies and the amount of STDs.
Okay.
So why do we think that there is a responsibility for the government to educate, specifically when it comes to sex education.
Well, firstly, there's a recognized responsibility from the government to educate its populace in all other aspects.
So, almost every developed every developed nation, almost every nation, has some form of public education.
Because it's recognized that in order to have a functioning society, you need to have a well-educated populace, and that parents simply are not equipped, both because they simply don't have the time to teach their their their youth, their children, the that the wide array of things that people need to be able to know in order to function in society, and because they themselves are not personally equipped, are not experts, do not have the capabilities of educating young people.
We don't think that sex is any different.
While sex is something that is incredibly personal, the ability to do your accounting, to understand your finances, to be physically fit, these are things that are also incredibly personal, yet we say the state has a responsibility to ensure that these things are taught amongst young people.
We also think that parents are not qualified in teaching sex education.
While many people may think it is the responsibility of parents to sit down with their children and, quote unquote, have the talk, we think that it's clearly the case that parents, in many respects, do not have the knowledge of how contraceptives are used.
They don't have the knowledge about how STDs work and how they spread, or how to understand that you may have one or to be able to recognize these things, and they don't know about the advances in contraceptive, the most advanced scientific understanding of these things.
Given that this is the case, sex is something sex and sex education is biological, it's something that can be understood through science, through education.
Just because it is something that is personal, doesn't mean that it's not something that can be broken down and given education to people.
So, we also think that sex is crucial for personal development and well-being, more so than many other subjects that are taught in school, and there are huge risks that are associated with not having sex education.
In places in the united states in which sex education is not provided, or abstinence-only sex education is provided, these are the areas that have the highest rates of STDs and the highest rates of unwanted pregnancy.
And what it shows is that regardless of whether or not the government decides to step in and decides to educate people about sex, people are going to choose to have sex.
Young people are going to want to explore their sexuality and are going to want to do these types of things.
The only difference, and what this debate is really about, is whether we want children, whether we want young people getting their information from less reputable sources, getting it from older siblings or from parents who simply don't have the scientific knowledge, or worse yet, getting it from places like pornography or the internet, in which anything can be put out, mostly things that are false, things that simply aren't proper representations of sex, sexuality and contraceptive usage.
We think that given that the alternative to having comprehensive sex education is people continuing to have sex, but having less safe sex which creates immense harms not only on them as individuals but also on society.
When we are forced to bear the burden of their health cost, forced to bear the burden of unwanted children in our orphanages and through our welfare systems, these are things that clearly have immense social impacts.
We think that sex is crucial to someone's personal development, and not being given a proper sex education is a risk that the government should not be willing to take, it's not something that should be acceptable in our society.
And for these reasons, sex education should be mandatory."
"We should increase the fuel tax.
The way that we're going to do this and the way that we're going to structure this we think is very straightforward.
For all fossil fuels no matter what type of fossil fuel they are, no matter where they come from, at the point of sale of that fossil fuel we're going to put a tax on the fuel itself which means even if you don't use it at any point you're going to be taxed at a higher rate than you are currently in order to use it.
We'd say that the number of increase in this fuel tax is not you know especially relevant but we're going to say it will be a substantial increase in the fuel tax upwards of fifteen, twenty percent.
A very high increase in that tax.
Two reasons why we think this is so crucial.
The first is about global warming and the second is about market fairness.
On global warming, we would say that global warming is the largest threat that humanity faces in this day and age and that if we do not stop using fossil fuels at the rate we are currently using them we will be in a situation in which massive flooding occurs, in which global ice caps shrink, in which there are more and more of the disastrous weather events that we are already seeing occur in our in the form of hurricanes, in the form of tornadoes, in the form of mud slides, all of these things that are caused by increasing global temperatures and by global warming that is largely directed and largely the side effect of fossil fuel usage.
We would say that having this type of tax is a direct way of disincentivizing using fossil fuels.
If I need to pay more money to drive my car to work to fill up the tank to drive my car to work each and every day then I'm probably more likely to use public transportation where I don't have to pay the successive tax.
If I don't if if there are viable alternatives that exist and these types of fossil fuels become dramatically more expensive, most people, we would say, would be willing to shift their behavior in a way that can actually dramatically decrease the amount of fossil fuels we're using in the status quo.
We don't care about the fossil fuel industries.
We don't care about the fact that people are often dependent on these fossil fuels for jobs and for employment all that stuff.
If we do not stop the behavior we're doing now most coastal cities will be underground in a hundred years.
The earth will no longer be as habitable as it is now.
We will leave a situation in a planet that our children will have to pick up the trash for afterwards.
We do not think that that is a just situation to leave for our children.
We do not think that the suffering that is caused by the flooding, the droughts, the horrible weather events, the disastrous natural disasters that are coming in are status quo we don't think that this is worth any sort of job increase and this fuel tax will go a long way in tackling our use of fossil fuels but even if you don't care about any of that, it's impossible to ignore that there is a negative externality that is coming from fossil fuels.
That there is a deterioration of our environment whether it be oil spills that occasionally happen, whether it be the pollution of our water supply, whether it be the harms that come from fracking and mining for coal.
All of these things are negative externalities but these negative externalities are not being paid for at the price point.
What this means is in the status quo in the field of providing energy fossil fuels are at a market advantage in an unfair market advantage that other types of fuel and other types of of electricity and other types of energy do not have.
Given that this is the case, we think that increasing the fuel tax makes it these markets more fair and more free.
Means that you create a more competitive market where given that someone needs to pay for those spills, someone needs to pay for those negative externalities of fossil fuels.
We think it is best to make the producers pay for it.
To make the consumers pay for it.
Rather than those that are left behind having to clean up after them and the positive benefit of this is that you get a more free market.
A market in which solar and wind and nuclear become more competitive on the energy market with fossil fuels.
On top of that, we think that it is just clear that global warming is here.
It is happening now and if we do not take steps like increasing the fuel tax in order to prevent people from using more fossil fuels we believe we will regret it in the long term.
For these reasons, we should increase fuel tax."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion, that we should prohibit human cloning.
Three independent points, first safety.
So, I think dolly stands as a pretty good example, that is dolly the cloned sheep, of why cloning generally has unintended consequences from a medical perspective.
That is, that when we clone something, its genetic makeup is often unpredictable, that the process by which we clone is still wildly unknown, and we have yet to make a sustainably cloned anything really.
This is an issue, because it means that, in the interim, of when we develop this technology, there will be mass suffering, just inevitably speaking, because we are going to have to learn how to do this properly.
So, I think just off the bat, suffering created by virtue of those the follies along the way, is going to be a serious issue.
But let's take the generous but I think that's even under a generous perspective, right?
Like even that's even if you get to the end, and I don't think that that's a given, that you can quite clearly wind up at an end point, where you realize: oh, this just isn't something we can do, this just isn't scientifically sustainable.
In which case, you have created, like, all of this suffering, for basically no reason.
I think that's a significant issue.
Second independent point is property questions.
So, I think really this breaks down into two ways, one much more significant than the other.
The comparatively less significant one is just sort of questions over who owns what.
So, in terms of, if I get cloned, what is like the legal difference between me my clone?
Presumably, we have the same experiences, we have , you know, sort of the same understanding of the world, and we are for all intents and purposes the same person, from a legal perspective.
I think that creates a question then, not just of like who can consent into what, and at what point do we stop being separate persons, did I like force them to consent into previous life choices, also who owns our stuff, because we are like the same person.
I think there's a lot of questions that arise here, that just do not have actual solutions, that there just isn't a way, really, for you to resolve these claims, at the point where you accept the two people as true copies of one another.
But, the much more significant way, in which this plays out, is the question of whether or not people, who create clones, have ownership over the clones.
I think the fact that society does, like, a lot of light footing, around whether or not clones are ethical, means that there's going to be a lot of light footing, around whether or not the clones actually constitute human life.
Given that, I think there is a serious risk of you developing a system, wherein the clones are consider property, and you have the serious autonomy violations upon the clones, at which point there is a serious harm.
Like I think, generally speaking, these autonomy bright lines can be extended to animals too, and that, generally, keeping animals in cages is recognized as a bad thing, and owning these things is considered like problematic, at least to a marginal degree, so I think when we do this with something that is approaching humanity, it is pretty uniformly recognized as a bad idea, and I think that that's a significant risk.
So, on our third point then, that is decreased diversity under cloning.
So, diversity goes down as a product of the fact, that you have like these reproductive processes of the status quo, that ensure mixing of genes, that is that no two humans are alike.
In the cloning system though, that obviously doesn't happen.
You have uniform genes being perpetuated across generations.
That's an issue for two reasons, one is that, I think, we just generally find diversity to be a good thing, that like distinctions in the human race just force us to come to grips with the fact, that not everyone is alike, and that there is a social component to it, but secondly, resistance against diseases isn't mitigated, when you don't have this like complexity in of like organisms, that is if one disease figures out how to beat a frequently cloned humans to like immune system, then like humanity is just at a seriously seriously tricky point.
Proud to propose."
"We should abolish congressional earmarks.
So, by abolish, we think that congress should be forbidden from including earmarks in legislation and by congressional earmarks, we mean language in laws requiring spending in a specific area beyond the required level of specificity for the law to take effect.
So, this might be an example of if the federal government were to build new highways, congress requiring that the highway go between town a and town b in a particular state, rather than just saying look, have the executive branch figure out where the highways ought to go.
So, two big arguments here: one is that this undermines the executive branch and the second is that this is fundamentally corrupt.
So, regarding the executive branch, the US constitution sets out very clear separation of powers.
Among these separations is that the legislative branch, namely, congress, gets to determine what the government is going to spend their money on by passing laws that allocate funding.
However, it's up to the executive branch to determine how to use this funding after it's been approved.
So, the executive branch has tens and tens of thousands of professional employees whose job is to determine how best to spend the federal government's money.
So, it might help to think of this as congress is the big picture.
They say we want highways and the federal government has the people with the expertise to determine how these highways should be built and where and by whom.
But when the legislative branch, when congress decides that they're going to include earmarks, they prevent the executive branch from doing this.
It doesn't matter if experts on highway construction in the executive branch say that this road needs to be built between town c and b if congress has already included requirements in the law that it go between a and b because that's convenient for some senator who's up for reelection this year.
It is inconvenient for the executive branch to have to balance all of these concerns which are often contradictory as different congress people require different earmarks and different bills and this leads to it being very difficult for them to do their jobs, to the point where they're spending more time dealing with earmarks than they are dealing with how to best actually carry out business.
This ultimately also leads to much less effective spending.
If congress approves the amount of money that it should take to build a road but they include requirements that make the road much more expensive to build because it has to go to lots of towns that shouldn't have been included on the highway in the first place, then ultimately, the taxpayers are going to have to borrow money rather than spend the money that they were actually allocated because congress is making it more expensive to get something done.
We also think that the cycle of greed creates mistrust and resentment between the executive branch and the legislative branch which makes it more difficult for the two groups to get their business done, as the legislators know that the executives want to take away their precious earmarks and the executive branch knows that their job would be much easier if they were just allowed to get things done.
So, our second argument is that this is fundamentally corrupt, which is probably pretty apparent because basically what this does is lets congress people buy reelection through what we call pork barrel spending.
Basically, congress people can say look, I will get a bridge built in our town that'll employee lots of people and buy supplies from local businesses, but only if you reelect me.
Otherwise, I won't get it.
So, in that way, the voters know that they can basically sell their vote to the congress person to get federal money.
So, what this means is leads to huge waste and redundancy.
A good example is that in the US, even though we have tons of battle tanks and the army doesn't ever expect to fight another war where we use these tanks, we keep building them because there are requirements set by congress in the form of earmarks that require tank factories in certain towns because the employment that these factories create is part of how certain senators get reelected.
The same thing with the US government, literally building bridges that don't go anywhere because of earmarks.
And certain representatives even hold congress hostage and refused to pass things like emergency relief bills after hurricanes unless earmarks are put in that help their district up in nebraska who wasn't affected by the hurricane at all.
So, what we can see is that this is tremendously corrupt and undermines the executive branch, so we should abolish congressional earmarks.
Thank you."
"We should fight against sedentary lifestyles.
On our side we're going to explain first why there is a clear and compelling government interest in fighting this type of lifestyle and second on how this affects the country's labor force and economy in the long term.
So first let's talk about when governments can intervene and tell people how to live their lives.
We think there are a few instances.
The first would be when there is an information asymmetry that is to say when there's a lack of knowledge on the part of one party that prevents them from making a good decision.
And I think this is really true for a lot of sedentary lifestyles.
We see in america at least and I think in many other countries too that low education people tend to be much more likely to be obese and to lead sedentary lifestyles than more educated people.
One reason that this is probably true is that the more educated you are the more likely you are to have had nutritional education and to understand not only how to avoid putting on weight but how to be healthy and active.
Many people for instance don't really consider that you need to exercise for thirty minutes a day ideally eat in order to be active and they think about oh well I walk to my car and I walk to work from my car and don't think about the fact that they may have only done ten minutes of activity in their entire day.
Obviously this is really bad for their health and because it springs from a lack of knowledge and understanding of how to lead a healthy lifestyle we think that the government is completely justified in stepping in on their behalf.
Since one reason why we have a government is to act on the behalf of people who can't make well informed decisions for themselves.
The next time the state should get involved is if there are third party harms.
And I think it's clear that sedentary lifestyles do harm other people because they drive up the cost of healthcare for everyone.
One reason why health insurance in america is so expensive is because the rate of obesity has made it so that the insurance companies are paying out more and more money to pay for treatments of obesity and a lot of times this could be easily prevented if people were more active as young adults.
So we see that there is a third party harm to everyone because the cost of healthcare are born at least partly by the public as a whole.
And finally we think the state can tell people what to do when there is a compelling state interest.
And again because in most countries most civilized countries unlike america the state pays for people's health care there is a compelling state interest to keep health or health care costs low.
So national health in britain for instance has a clear interest in telling people to lead an active lifestyle in order to keep their costs down.
Our second argument aside from the fact that the state is justified in doing this is that it's really bad for your labor force to have people leading a sedentary lifestyle.
When people lead a sedentary lifestyle first of all they don't live as long.
People are more likely to die young which is obviously bad for your work force because not only are they not sometimes working as much as they could in their own lifetime but more importantly they're not around for their children and therefore it's going to be harder for their children to get a good education and get good advice and grow up to be healthy and productive members of society.
But aside from that when you think about the work force people who are ill have less energy.
People who are sedentary have less energy.
There are less able to work long periods of time.
There are many jobs that they can't do because they're not able to do physical activity.
So we see that there are real costs in terms of lost labor when you have a sedentary work force.
Why is this really bad?
Well many developing countries have increasing rates of obesity that would indicate that more people are being sedentary and it's harder for them to develop if they're getting fewer man hours that up there people every year.
Since a sedentary lifestyle limits the amount of labor that people can do limits those man hours in other words we think that it's something that you need to be very concerned about as a developing country if you want to increase standards of living in the future.
For all these reasons we should fight against the sedentary lifestyle.
Thank you."
"I'm proud to stand on proposition of today's motion that we should abandon television.
The battle is going to be that we should just pursue what is the natural progression of the entertainment industry in transition over to internet based streaming.
So what we would say is that in the info slide there is described this idea of like television is like this rigid thing, there is a monitor, a screen, you watch the screen, that's how you get your whatever it is that you're watching.
We would transition to more flexible services like , you know, mobile device streaming, laptop streaming, whatever it is.
But we would say generally speaking, internet would become the medium that we would transition to if we were to abandon television.
Three independent points as to why this would be a good thing.
First, that it would lead to better news, second, that it would lead to better entertainment, and third, that it would lead to better health.
So first, on news.
We would say that television news historically was the way that a lot of people got their news, the twenty four hour news cycle was initiated by television, so it's unlikely that this would change through internet, and I think the fact that a lot of people currently consume their news through the internet is demonstrating the fact that the twenty four hour news cycle will continue.
There are three areas that in which news is better accessed or is portrayed better on the internet.
First is the reach, that the internet is more accessible to a larger number of people, there is less sort of this like like factional territorialism with local news channels and things like that, so individual channels reach a larger number of people.
Second is that there are more sources, so you can get things like anything from like far right sites to really far left sites, there are tons of centrist sites, things like vox media or the atlantic or whatever, that generally would not be reachable by television, because there just wasn't as large of an audience at any given point in time to justify so many diverse viewpoints, this is now accessible through the internet.
And third is better fact checking, that organizations like politico and things like that are more capable of checking facts in real time, because they have the resources through the internet and through things like google and large internet databases to pursue that fact checking more quickly, you can also just like see the fact checking on site, like people can literally comment this in the post like, hey here's this link to this like you know a politifact article that like disputes this thing that's in a great part of the article.
Second is entertainment.
So three ways in which entertainment is improved in internet transmission.
First is that it's a less rigid medium which gives creators more flexibility to operate with under the item.
Second is wider availability, so again this is just a broader audience, more people will be accessing your thing, that means more money pumping into the entertainment industry, and as a result that means more opportunities for people to create, and third is less barriers to entry.
So I think youtube is like a really good example of this, wherein there isn't like this really difficult thing to leap, you don't have to be in the industry for like tons and tons of time to get your television access, like if the generous interpretation of television as an accessible medium is like adult swim or it's like new artists can work in that space, I think like youtube is always going to beat that out, and other you know easily accessible mediums by which people can sort of gain popularity.
Think vine for example has a good history of like promoting a lot of comedians that normally wouldn't have had such easy access, that again leads to more diversity in viewpoints within the entertainment industry.
Our third independent point is health.
I think there's two ways in which TV mitigates or harms your health.
First is just like the like health effects of staring at these things for a long time, like the LED screens and things just have like ocular effects that are not as severe with laptops and mobile screens, because they are smaller and because they are like designed in just a better way.
But secondly is the like sitting down for long stretches of time effect, like this is referred to as like being a couch potato sometimes, that's less likely to happen when a large percentage of your media is being consumed on mobile devices though, like people could walk around and watch TV, so we think the health benefits are less or the health harms are less severe in a world where internet is the predominant medium.
Proud to propose."
"I stand in proud proposition of lifting the UN ban on the production of coca beans.
And specifically coca leaves, not cocaine.
I would model this as the UN lifting its ban on this production, so that countries can act independently, and not have this international order bearing down upon their decision making.
I would say that, most nations probably won't take this opportunity.
Most western countries like say, the UK or the US, probably wouldn't take the option of legalizing the production of coca leaves in their country.
We would say that only countries that really have the cultural significance attached to the coca leaf, like bolivia or peru, would actually take that option, and go forward with the legalization of it.
Three independent points for why the UN ought do this.
First, cultural rights, second the pernicious nature of black market, and third the economies of struggling nations.
First, on the cultural rights.
It;s important to recognize that, the two countries that are at stake here, bolivia and peru, are countries that have deep cultural connections to the coca leaf, and it's important to recognize that, by extension, they have the right to act upon their cultural history, and have that autonomy.
The UN is not supposed to be an organization that dictates culture, or norms to other groups.
It is supposed to be norms that are not universal.
The UN's position is to alleviate suffering, and alleviate it in ways that are objective.
Things like, genocide, things like mass harm that is objective, but when when the lion's share of people, within an individual country, consent into the existence of an industry, that country should have the right to have that happen.
The UN should act as a check on authoritarianism, but not on the democratic process.
So, it's important to give the right of these countries to actually have this industry, if they so desire.
It's also important to recognize the international legitimacy harms that stem from this.
That bolivia and peru's boldness to stand up against the international regime, and ask for permission to do what they please, leads them to unfair ridicule on an international stage, and that undermines their presence in things like trade negotiations, in ways that have very tangible harms on their citizens.
We think that, taking away this international regime and getting rid of this unfair sanctions on them, is always going to be preferable then.
Secondly black markets, the black market exists in these countries as, essentially a given, because there is demand for the product, so people will grow it, one way or another.
This is especially true in weak states, like bolivia and peru.
They just don't have the regulatory capacity to crackdown on this ruthlessly.
This has three problems then, that are generated when the black market exists, that are comparative to a world in which it is legalized.
First is less regulation.
We would say that like, less regulation is always true, when the government just doesn't have the ability to go into shops, and make sure that they are up to code and complying.
That translates into safety harm for the people.
Secondly, you can't tax the product, because it is not being sold in legal markets, and as a result the social safety net suffers, things like welfare, or education, can always be better funded in a world where this is legal.
Thirdly is cartel violence that, because there is no regulation, powerful actors have an incentive to grab upon this cash rich industry that is not being taxed, and as a result violence, like what you see with the marijuana industry, and cocaine industries in mexico, is sure to ensue.
We always mitigate the harms of that in a world where legal markets are permitted to thrive.
My last independent point is the economic benefits of legalization.
I would say that the you increase industry, in a struggling economy, by gaining this.
You just create a new industry that provides, not just jobs, but also a multiplier effect in that people, you know, have those jobs, get the money from those jobs, go buy other things in the economy.
You know, this is how economies work, that the economy can blossom, when you add new industry, and when you add new employment.
Given that, we think there is just an objective benefit to giving the economy this stimulus, this boost that will allow it to progress, especially in a country like bolivia, or peru, that is struggling economically right now.
I think it's important to recognize autonomy in this debate, because that's the crucial question here.
It's important to recognize that countries, like bolivia and peru, have the right to say: this is what we want, this is what our people demand, and this is what we're going to do.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should prohibit corporal punishment.
We would prohibit this in all spheres, so in schools, in homes, by any of authorities.
So like gymnastics classes, dance classes etcetera.
Two main areas of clash: first we wanna talk about harms to the individual.
Corporal punishment promotes a distrust and avoidance and avoidance behaviors, that are actually quite dangerous.
Because when you are beaten for an undesirable trait or behavior, you don't actually learn not to do it again, rather you learn not to get caught.
This is because we often see that children make a weighing calculus between whether or not they should take an action.
And if they can come up with a like rational reason not to do it, IE it'll hurt someone's feelings or it'll set about precedent, then often times kids are pretty reasonable, and they recognize that it's going to be worse for them the long term so they choose not to do it.
But if you simplify that decision and take out that rational reasoning, then all you leave them with is like a physical pro and con.
So if they can get away with not getting caught but still get the benefits of whatever that action provided them, then they're obviously still going to take it, just based on like mathematical reasoning essentially of this child.
So we think that what happens on their side of the house is that you actually have people who are more likely to lie to authority figures.
This is bad both because it means there's no proper oversight but also because these behaviors, if you're beating them for it, are probably behaviors that were either dangerous or bad or potentially dangerous.
And so what this means is that not only there is the direct harm of whatever that behavior was occurring, but it also means that if something really bad occurred, children be too scared to come to an authority figure to try and fix it.
We think this is how things spiral out of control.
Like when children are too afraid to go to an authority figure, that's when they tried fix it on their own, that's when really dangerous stuff happens.
And we would prefer for that to not occur.
Second though, we want to talk about how this delegitimizes the space.
Because a lot of the time corporal punishment occurs in schools, which is clearly supposed to be this like learning open space in which children need to feel comfortable, because they need to accomplish at a lot of very productive work there.
But if you no longer feel secure in that space, because it is essentially a location of a trauma, we think that you also can no longer learn there.
And that's a really big problem because if you're going to be attending this school for a long period of time, as often occurs when there's like an elementary school that contains classes from like kindergarten to fifth, it basically like taints your entire learning experience in that area.
We also just wanna drop statistics here.
Like statistically corporal punishment is tied to increased depression and low self esteem.
Our second area of clash has to do with harms to society.
Harms to society.
First, it promotes violence.
It tells children that you can beat someone into submission, and that having more power physically makes you more right.
Because essentially that's the model you're providing.
Teachers aren't actually explaining to them why they're correct or parents, rather they're just beating them and saying: "" look, like because I hit you, because I'm discouraging this behavior, like I must be right.
You must listen to me because of my physical prowess. ""
And we think this is a really big problem because in the end all this does is creates a world in which rather than looking to reason with individuals and understand their feelings, children are just looking to gain as much power over these individuals as possible, because that's how they've been taught they can actually show that they are correct or right.
We also think that it promotes for traditional power imbalances.
Statistically children of colors and those with disabilities are going to get a lot more punishment corporally than those without disabilities, or children who are white.
And so we think that a lot of the time it just promotes those same kind of things that we've been trying to break free of since the civil rights movement.
And we also think it allows parents to cover up abuse.
Because in the end, we think that op has to point out a distinct line between corporal punishment and like physical long term abuse.
And moreover they need to point out why governmental bodies are going to be able to track this effectively, because we think that they just won't.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should subsidize renewable energy.
So, in this round, we're obviously not going to specify what types of renewable energy we're subsidizing, but we think that we would subsidize both the production and the use of of renewable energy by private actors and by private households.
And we think that renewable energy can be anything from wind to solar to nuclear to , you know, other types of production that don't create this type of fossil fuel dependency.
So, two reasons why we should subsidize renewable energy.
The first is because of global warming, and the second is because it is economically beneficial to do so.
On global warming: we think that it's undeniable that global warming is the biggest threat to humanity's survival.
It is it is expected that in the next fifty years, rising sea levels are going to destroy are going to destroy huge economic urban hubs.
The reason for this is that rising sea levels are often are going to happen.
The rate at which carbon dioxide has been captured in our atmosphere means that we are destined to warm a certain amount moving forward.
This means that with more CO two that's put into the atmosphere, there's further rising sea levels, which increases the scale of the harm to these urban areas because these urban areas, these economic hubs in nations, are empirically built around built on the water.
They were originally port cities and now they're economic hubs.
We think there's also additional harms that come with global warming: for example, extreme weather events and a lack and a lack of seasonal regularity, which leads to harms like a lack of food production.
It means you can't produce you can't produce your agricultural goods in the same ways that you were before.
In addition to the harms that are already coming, we're approaching a tipping point of no return where the atmosphere and the temperatures are going to are going to rise by four degrees celsius over the next one hundred years and put us on a path put us on a path where we really cannot come back from this harm, and you can expect a massive downgrade in quality of life.
We need to care about this, and we need to care about it now.
Waiting another ten or fifteen years to solve this problem or to address this problem, to subsidize and move to renewable energies, is ten years far too late.
Our own survival and the survival of future people who did not choose to come into the world, who did not choose to use fossil fuels, who did who are in no way responsible for the current world that we are creating, we have an obligation to them and we have an obligation to ourselves to protect the only planet that we have, and without moving to renewable energies immediately, there's no way that this can happen.
We think that subsidies are going to work, that people are going to take up the opportunity to use green tech because it is more affordable when it's subsidized.
It's also more efficient than other means of production, like fossil fuels are in the status quo, and that change needs to happen now.
Regardless of global warming, we think that there's an economic boom that comes with renewable energies.
The reason for this is that, as I just said, these energies are more efficient, and they can become even more efficient with more technological growth.
Solar cells become more and more efficient every year, but that doesn't just happen stagnantly.
That doesn't just happen by some sort of law of nature.
It requires jobs and hard work and technological innovation to make these things happen, and that's true across renewable energy fields.
This means a few things.
First, there are more jobs in renewable energy.
If you look at things like mining and oil production, jobs have been on the decline for the last two decades whereas clean tech jobs are on the rise.
Pushing and subsidizing that renewable energy field only means there are more jobs available and more production in the future.
We also think that clean tech becoming more efficient means the cost of energy production goes down, which means even if the industry itself isn't providing a tremendous amount of jobs, it's saving money in all parts of the economy, leading to further production in all sectors, more savings for households, and a better economic more economic health for the people of a state.
Given that global warming is coming, given that it is economically prudent to make this change, we should absolutely subsidize renewable energy."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should ban herbal medicine.
First I just wanna offer sort of a working definition of what herbal medicine constitutes.
We would say that this does not constitute anything that's officially recognized by the FDA, even if it you know employees certain herbs in it.
We would just say that this is you know the sort of thing that isn't actually recognized as a actual medicine by any sort of you know governing body.
These are things like you know ground-up roots and what not that you put in your tea and it's supposed to cure cancer.
Now, this isn't by any means you know sanctioned by the FDA.
So with that, two independent points: first is that broadly speaking, we want to establish that the standards for when we can engage in a ban are one of two things: either one is objective harm inflicted upon the individual.
This, for example, is you know why we mandate that people go to school.
Because it's something that even if it's a restriction on your autonomy it is still something that objectively benefits you.
But second is basically information asymmetries.
That people cannot meaningfully consent into an action if they are you know deliberately being misled by the industry or if they just generally are not properly informed in the decision.
So my first independent point is information asymmetries.
That meaningful consent doesn't apply when we're talking about usage of herbal medicine because there is a specific information asymmetry between the consumer and the seller.
On this want to know that you know medicine is something that is really really complicated.
People but a pharmaceutical school for years to get even like a passing understanding of how some of this medicine works.
It's really important then, to recognize that the average consumer isn't in a position to actually understand what medicine they need for what purposes.
This is why we generally require that people go through a doctor to get a prescription before they take medicine, so that they actually have someone working with them that understands this stuff, so that they can you know make the right decisions, get the right treatment and so on.
The problem with herbal medicine of course is that you don't go to a doctor.
You don't go to a professional, usually you know herbal medicine practitioners are not licensed by any way shape or form, even if they are someone that isn't just out to make a quick buck and does genuinely believe in the healing properties of this, they're still by no means an expert.
This is a problem then because people don't actually have a capacity to meaningfully consent to such a complex decision if they don't understand what's going on in the first place.
They haven't been properly informed.
We don't think that we should allow this to continue occurring, thus a ban is justified.
Our second independent point though is the objective harm that is intrinsic to herbal medicine.
I think this plays out in two ways: the first is quite simple.
That when it does absolutely nothing, people just don't seek a cure.
You know your your taking, whatever, like ground-up route and that's all well and fine, and maybe it's even kind of healthy in terms of improving your diet, but this isn't something that actually constitutes a cure for whatever illness you have.
That's a problem of course because that means then that you are significantly more likely to suffer and potentially even die by virtue of your illness, if you aren't seeking the proper care and if you aren't actually being treated for your illness.
But the second I think is a lot more important in terms of the way that actually harms people, and that's improper use.
Herbal medicine can really harm you in two ways: the first is that certain types of herbs and things like that, that are put in combination with one another, can create effects that aren't seen by regulators.
So generally speaking, if I just have some ground-up root, I'm probably going to be fine because whatever regulatory food agency determined that that route was okay for consumption and sale in the first place, will probably be fine with me grinding up and taking it even if I tell myself it's medicine.
The problem is in the combinations.
But secondly we also think that like when people combine these with actual medicine, unwittingly thinking they can have the best of both worlds, there is a very high risk for harmful side effects.
Given this then, because they don't have because we don't have much capacity to regulate this from a medicinal standpoint, because the FDA won't recognize these as actual medicines, then at that point we have to we have to engage in a ban.
Because we have to ensure that these did that these substances aren't being used improperly and aren't being used in ways that harm the individuals that consume them.
Proud to propose."
"We should fight gender inequality.
So, in this round, we don't want to present too much of a model.
We think that this is more of a principled round.
We think there there are many mechanisms the government can take, for example, providing affirmative action for women in public spheres of employment, providing tax breaks to women based on the pay gap that they face, other types of things that can fight gender inequality, but we think this round is more about principle and that's what we're gonna provide for you, two principled reasons why you should do this.
The first is that we think there's a historical right to reparations for women, and the second is that we think there are just good social outcomes when you fight gender inequality.
So, on that first point.
We would say that it is an undeniable fact that society has historically discriminated against women and disenfranchised them.
What are some of those ways?
Firstly, for large portions of history, women were entirely excluded from holding any sort of political power, even up to as early or as late as the mid nineteen fifties in some developed countries, and today in many developing countries, women do not have the ability to express their voice politically, to hold political office, or even to vote for people that express their views.
Secondly, there's confinement to non-paying labor, like staying at home and raising children or being forced into bad labor conditions.
Oftentimes, both of these facets are done through coercive means, whether they're explicit coercive means like a male figure forcing an individual woman to do this or because of immense social pressures that are placed on them that mean that they have no meaningful choice over the sphere they're entering.
We also think that stereotyping women as a gender as weak, hopeless, and building structures accordingly that try and confine women to these types of notions that we hold about them.
And fourthly, these these women are victims of having their bodily autonomy violated at a much higher rate than men, whether it's through things like sexual crimes or simply domestic violence.
These are things that women have to face that men simply do not, amongst many more patriarchal structures.
And men have benefitted from this and continue to do in the present.
And these patriarchal structures, in many cases, still remain, with the purpose to keep women out of these male spaces and consolidate power amongst men.
We think that we have a clear obligation to correct this given that, as men as a man myself and all men, that we have benefited from these patriarchal structures and continue to benefit from them, given given their unjust nature, the arbitrary distinctions drawn between genders and the overt harm placed on women, we have a right to give of ourselves in order to correct these past harms and to correct the present harms.
So, aside from those obligations, what about those good social outcomes?
Well, recognize that half literally half of the world population are women.
So regardless of any obligation, we think it would be a preferable world if fifty percent of people were to be benefitted from having gender inequality addresssed.
We think that more equitable earnings, for example, could give more financial independence and leverage for women, not only in the public sphere but also in the private sphere, in instances in which women may be tied to men financially who they may not want to be with.
We also think that women in positions of power serve not only as role models to empower the future, but also to work to to move women's issues forward as well as to provide new perspectives on old problems.
Men have had literally centuries to try and address and build a world that is equitable for all, and have clearly failed markedly at this task.
We think that maybe women should get a shot.
Finally, on the lottery of birth.
We think that we shouldn't be satisfied with abandoning half of the population to a lesser status because of the random chance of what chromosomes you were born with.
We think that it is demonstrably unjust that women still face these types of medieval harms and these types of discriminatory practices time and again across all social spheres.
We think that there's an obligation of all men and all people to fight against this, and for these reasons, we should fight gender inequality."
"We should adopt the metric system.
Two two main arguments: first on streamlining the education system.
In the status quo people have to learn the metric system later in their education either way because the majority of higher level science and mathematics is done in the metric system not in the american system.
This can be really confusing for students who spend so much time and effort memorizing and working with the american system only to find out that the system is completely irrelevant to them and they have to learn and use an entirely different system in the future anyway.
We also just think it's more efficient to start off by teaching the right material rather than having to back-pedal later.
We think that the the original system in our current education system becomes useless information and a waste of student time to learn it in the first place and we think that you should have more respect for american children and their time than to force them through this.
It's really stupid that we don't do this the status quo and is the result of a stupid appeal to to tradition.
The idea that because we've been doing it for so long and this is the system that our grandparents grew up with this is why we should maintain it.
This is literal nonsense and not a reason to not to make positive changes into the future and even without this, the metric system is just a better system.
It is much simpler.
It pretty much just goes up by hundreds with each like increment and interval of measurement whereas for the american system you have really stupid conversions like two point five centimeters in an inch and twelve inches per foot and you know how many foots feet are in a yard?
Three for some unknown reason.
These are all individual conversions that people have to learn as compared to the metric system where you can just remember that you have base hundred in everything and then go up by a hundred for each next one.
And the best part about this is that the metric system will apply both to measures of distance, as well as to measures of volume, as well as to measures of density, and anything else because you can just use the same general language and the same words to describe each of these intervals.
It's also easier to memorize and it's especially better for children who struggle with memorizing the random conversions of the american system a lot more than the smooth and easy intervals of the metric system.
Then it's easier to use.
Mathematically the conversion is easy dividing by base hundred rather than having to do weird conversions between two point five centimeters per inch and twelve inches per foot and also just streamlines your educational materials as well because you use the same beginning of the word depending on what kind of units we're talking about.
So everything becomes pico whether it is meters or milliliters.
Our second argument is about globalizing measurement system.
There's a problem in the status quo were literally every other country is using the metric system while the united states holds onto a nonsense system of measurements.
It makes it really hard for children to adjust if they do any work with people from other countries and it makes it harder to start international collaboration in education earlier.
You can't teach children the same higher level concept as early as other nations can because you just finished teaching them the wrong system of measurement for all of those higher level concepts.
We want to put american kids on a level playing field with those who aren't.
Like at the end of the day, we've seen that american rankings in education have been consistently dropping for the last few years and a lot of this has to do with the way that we approach education when we prioritize these kinds of useless systems above maintaining good communication and good globalization of these kinds of educational materials.
The continual use of the american measuring system is just showing how stupid and how old and outdated american education systems as a whole are.
The idea that we are willing to compromise our efficiency and compromise our children's education just to hold on to some old and arbitrary system of measurement.
Proud to propose."
"We should abandon television, because it is archaic, expensive, unnecessary, and not good enough compared to what we have.
So, let's talk about the comparative first, because that's a very big part of this debate.
I think that the comparative is that, when we abandon television, we ultimately have an alternative, and I think that that alternative, in our present technological age, is likely to be the internet.
So, what we're going to argue is that, the using the internet as a replacement for television is vastly preferable to the status quo.
So, I think there's two big reasons for this: first of which is money related, and the second of which is actualizing on your preferences.
So, first, let's talk about money.
So, televisions are incredibly expensive.
First and foremost you have to buy the TV itself, and you oftentimes have to buy like newer televisions, if you want to keep up with technology, so televisions themselves are expensive, and getting a good TV that works well can also be expensive.
Additionally, you have to find space for all that television.
Additionally, you also have to find you have to pay for a cable box, you to pay for a cable plan, which can be expensive, or a satellite plan.
Additionally, you have to pay for all like the electricity that it uses, things like that.
And these things can be expensive, I mean TV's can like several hundred dollars, cable can be like fifty dollars a month, or things like that, these aren't costs these things aren't nothing, so those that's important to note.
The other thing is because internet is so important, you likely have to pay for internet anyway.
So you're paying for all of these things, on top of internet, which can provide the pretty much same services roughly as television.
And, that's important, because, if you want like news, you can get news off the internet, if you want entertainment, you can get that off the internet, if you want videos, you can get that off the internet, there really isn't anything unique in value, that TVS provide, that you can't just get off of a computer.
So, it's basically just like a pointless waste of money, and I really don't understand why we shouldn't just abandon television, and move more towards like internet focused models.
This is especially important for poor people in society, or younger people in society, who may not also have the money for these kind of things, because they shouldn't be like like whether it's news, or more like official forms of news, so they don't have to be reliant on internet blogs, or bigger budget entertainment projects, these kinds of things shouldn't be like closed off to like people in society, just because they don't have the money to pay for it, and I think that, the internet is good as a comparative to TV, because it gives more people the ability to view these kinds of things.
But I also think that, abandoning television will be good for people's preferences, because in the status quo, in order to actually like get something that you want on television, there need to be enough people in society that actually agree with you.
So, there's less opportunities for experimental things, there's less opportunities for independent things, because there is a fear that not enough people are going to like it for it to actually succeed on TV.
But, when you take a lot of the financial problems out of this, the result that you get is, when you have it focused on internet, is that anyone can put out content on the internet, or you can have a much easier, because there's like less of a limit of air time, where you don't have to give the air time to the things that are going to make the most money, and limited time slots, this results in just a wider pool of content that you can choose from.
Because you can essentially have like an endless library, that people can view at any time.
So, that's important, because I think that what it results in is people can now watch what they want, when they want, at their own convenience, and in a lot of ways that's just a whole lot better for people, actually actualizing on their preferences.
So basically, like television is expensive, and it's not even that good at providing entertainment, or news, which is what its goal is supposed to be.
So, for all those reasons abandon television."
"The affordable care act brings more good than harm.
So the affordable care act, also known as obama care, is the current healthcare system in the united states.
Basically the way it works is everybody is required to have health insurance, if you don't receive it through your employer, as most americans do, then you can purchase it through an exchange which is set up by the government to allow people to purchase health insurance.
Since the ACA went into affect the cost of health insurance has gone up, although it was already increasing even before the bill was put into place.
So with that background, we have three reasons for why we think it's done more good than harm.
First, we think that for people with preexisting conditions, the affordable care act has been an enormous boon.
Before the affordable care act, health insurance companies in the US like blue cross, blue shield, didn't have to provide health insurance to people who had pre existing conditions.
So let's imagine that you had a relatively minor condition throughout your life, something like a non cancerous tumor that didn't need operation or removal, but it was just something that was part of your body.
Health insurance companies would legally be entitled to deny you coverage if you had something like that, even if it wouldn't increase your cost of care.
They would be able to rule you out and you wouldn't be able to purchase health insurance, in most regions, from anybody.
This would mean that you would have to pay out of pocket and it would be tremendously expensive.
Now, that's a be bad problem for the person I described, but for someone who has an expensive condition like diabetes for instance, that person would never be able to buy health insurance if they lost the plan they had when they discovered they had the disease, and ultimately their quality of life will be much lower than someone else's.
So we think the ACA has really helped these people.
Some of those wars stop in society.
Those who have diabetes, those were disabled, those who have a disabled family member, and we think that for that reason alone it has done more good than harm.
But we'll talk about two other things as well.
So our second point is about the uninsured.
Millions of people used to think that they couldn't get health insurance.
For some that was probably true, and others are probably just not making their priorities correctly.
But what this led to was lots of people who didn't have health insurance.
Millions of americans, tens of billions even.
Those people are much better off now that they have health insurance, although some of them may protest that they can't afford it, ultimately, having health insurance ensures that these people get preventive care, something that they wouldn't have received otherwise, and also that their dependents receive care.
So if you were a parent who made the questionable financial decision not to purchase health insurance, that meant that your children also didn't have health insurance.
Now, because everyone is required to purchase health insurance, we think that dependents such as the elderly and children are more likely to be taken care of.
And again, we think that the benefits of providing for those who are dependents are not able to take care of themselves more than outweigh the harms of some people having to spend money they didn't want to spend.
Our third point is about risk pooling.
So the way that the affordable care act works, the reason why it keeps costs down for those who have very high costs, like people with cancer, diabetes, is because it spreads the burden around.
Healthy young people who normally would pay very little without the affordable care act, now have to pay considerably more because they are taking on some of the cost of the health care for elderly people or ill people.
So what this means is that because everyone has a risk of becoming ill, now rather than falling on one person and completely destroying their life, forcing them to bankruptcy, the high cost of healthcare is spread around to everybody.
Now, lots of people like myself, young people who aren't ill, might resent having this burden put upon them.
But if it means that nobody has to run the risk of having their life destroyed by an expensive surgery or something like that, then ultimately it's worth it.
Everyone has more peace of mind, even if everyone is ultimately paying a little bit more over the course of their life.
So for these reasons: because we think that it's better for people with preexisting conditions who are some of those worst off in society, because it's better for the dependents of those without insurance previously, and because it shares the risks of high health insurance costs with everyone, we think that the a CA brings more good than harm.
Thank you."
"Operation cast lead was justified.
So, for those of you who aren't familiar.
Operation cast lead was an israeli defense forces ground invasion of gaza in january two thousand nine.
And for a little bit of background, this began after a ceasefire expired between hamas and israel, which led to rocket attacks from gaza onto southern israel.
Israel responded at first without a land invasion, and then with ground troops going into the gaza strip.
This went on for a period of a little less than a month, before both sides declared unilateral cease fires, and the israeli ground forces withdrew.
So, with those basic facts established, which I hope we can all agree with, let's talk about two reasons why this was justified.
But before we get into that, I want to talk a little bit about what we mean by justified.
We think that necessarily, the just thing need not always be the most humane thing, it need not always be the most pragmatic thing.
We think that justice involves restitution for victims and and enforcement of commonly accepted norms on people who are violating those norms.
And that this is why we have criminal justice systems which punish people, sometimes in inhumane ways, because we see that these norms need to be enforced and that people need to be punished for their wrongdoing.
So with that in mind, our first argument is that it is always just to react to provocation.
If somebody was throwing rocks at you as an individual, we think that it would be completely reasonable for you to go over and make them stop throwing rocks at you, even if that meant hitting them or knocking them down.
In the same way, unfortunately, gaza was behaving towards israel.
We see that hamas was using gaza as a base to shoot rockets into israel.
At that time the missile defense system was not as developed as it is now, and even in an era today when we have the missile defense system, we see that there is still a tremendous risk to civilians from these rocket attacks.
So in effect, hamas put israel into an untenable position.
We think it is always just for a state to react to an attack upon its sovereign soil.
Now the other team might say that israel has behaved unfairly in the past towards the palestinians, they might criticize the fact that israel is occupying west bank and in the past have occupied gaza, but we would tell you that at this given time, the area being attacked was legally controlled territory that no one contests in southern israel.
So certainly, israel has sovereign control over this soil, and is justified in protecting it, and to reacting to an attack against it.
Our second argument is about the duty of a state to its citizens.
So we think that the obligations of israel, like any other state, are primarily to its own citizens, rather than to any external actor.
Why is this true?
A state fundamentally exists because of a convention between all of the citizens of a country, that they will follow certain laws and implement a certain constitution, or in israel's case a basic law, in order to create a functional society that will protect their rights and privileges and freedoms, at the expence of giving up some of those rights, privileges and freedoms.
So the citizens are the people who have participated in this convention.
And I'd like to point out that in israel, this consists of many jews and arabs of different faiths, so we see that this is a multicultural society that includes many different types of people.
It's not as though israel were a state that systematically excluded one class of people from citizenship.
So with that in mind, we think that there is a duty of the state to protect its citizens from violence.
After all, citizens give up their own ability to protect themselves through violence to the state, in order to establish a monopoly of violence on behalf of the state, which will ultimately lead to greater safety for the citizens, or so they believe.
If the state fails to protect citizens from violence, then it is failing to meet the obligations that it takes on when it abrogates some of the freedoms of citizens.
For instance, individual citizens of israel were not free to go into gaza to stop these rocket attacks, even if they threatened their lives or property or well being, so we think that the state needed to act on their behalf.
And when a state fulfills its duties, we think that that can only be just, because there is an obligation that would not be met otherwise.
For these two reasons, we think that operation cast lead was justified.
Thank you."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should adopt zero tolerance policies in high schools.
We will model this is high schools.
Actually to schools in general and we'll say that specifically what we want to apply this to is things like weapons and drugs.
So generally speaking we will take a reasonable stance on this that no like symbology or anything like that would fall under it.
We are only talking about the physical item and we will take anything that is basically I will do a sniff test on what constitutes severity, but for drugs we would certainly say anything nonprescription so we're obviously not going to you know kick you out of school for like prescription medicine or anything like that.
With regards to weapons we would say we'll just sort of take like a firm line of things like knives or guns or things like that.
Things that are very clearly weapons and don't serve some sort of alternative purpose.
So three independent points.
First is that there isn't an acceptable reason for having these types of things on you.
Like I think we make exceptions for medicines, like that is a reasonable exception.
But generally speaking when we are talking about like adolescents holding guns there just isn't a legitimate justification for that.
There is absolutely no reason why is that that is a thing that you would have in a school and I think if there is any sort of like fringe marginal case that op can think of as to like, oh I don't know like maybe they need it for like like legitimately just cannot think of a reason and I think that serves as a testament to like how marginal the benefits of allowing people to have these types of things are on them are.
Our second independent point is externalities generated by possession of these items.
So really there are two important things that you have in school.
The first is that we have a school that operates well, it does the things that supposed to do like teaching students and things like that.
The second is that it has to provide a space where those operations can occur safely, where people feel comfortable learning, where people are not distracted from learning.
And we think the weapons and drugs are pretty harmful upon those goals.
That generally speaking if you are aware that your classmates have like weapons on them, like they are carrying guns and knives and things, that's not conducive to a healthy learning environment.
Likewise we think that like allowing students to like be high in class is also not particularly conducive to a learning environment.
So generally speaking it is bad then when the school is incapable of serving its primary purpose because of the existence of these items and we are very, very comfortable taking a firm stance against them.
Our third independent point is that it decreases subjectivity and enforcement.
So this is the particularly important component of zero tolerance policies is that they are not done on a case by case basis.
That if you are found with this item like the punishment is enforced.
Whether that's like expulsion or suspension or whatever, it is enforced no matter what and there are no exceptions to this.
So I think a really common example of where that subjectivity is harmful in the status quo is like jocks for example.
So like if you're like on a sports team and your coach catches you with this, the school is likely to just give you a slap on the wrist and say don't do it again.
Whereas if you don't have that type of good standing with the school, then you are a lot less likely to actually get that easy sentence.
We think that's bad because we think that generally speaking a crime or any sort of infraction like the severity of that infraction is not dependent on who you are as an individual.
That you don't deserve more punishment just because you're like not an athlete.
So when you take out that subjectivity and you take out the capacity for administrators and for teachers and coaches or whoever to be extremely subjective and case by case with their enforcement of rules, we think that creates a fairer system that is generally better towards its students.
Proud to propose."
"Randomized controlled trials bring more harm than good.
So, a randomized controlled trial is a type of scientific, generally medical experiment, which basically assigns people to groups randomly and attempts to reduce bias when we conduct medical experiments.
I think that the most typical case when these are used would be when testing new medications.
For instance, some people will be given a placebo, some people will be given the actual medication, and then the results would be compared at the end of the study.
We have two arguments for why we think these types of studies bring more harm than good.
First, we think that randomized controlled trials unfairly deny treatment to some individuals.
Remember that oftentimes these drugs are for very high stakes diseases.
Sure the other to make it appear and say this doesn't matter for talking about hair loss pills, but if we're talking about a drug for HIV, or diabetes, then people's lives are on the line when they enter these studies.
Oftentimes people are entering into these studies because there are no approved drugs or no existing drugs that can cure their illness.
So this might be people who have a rare type of a disease, or an uncommon disease for which there is no good treatment.
They're basically people with no other options.
So once they've entered the study, they have only a fifty fifty percent chance of receiving the best possible cure.
Because, recognize that by the time a drug has gotten to the point when it's going into a randomized controlled trials, doctors already think it's better than placebo.
If they didn't, then they wouldn't spend millions and millions of dollars in order to test it.
So what we see, is that people who are desperate for treatment, are not being given the treatment that they ultimately need.
Doctors already have good reason to believe that they could help these people and are choosing not to in the name of science.
More on that in just a minute.
But we think that it's principally unfair to give only half the people in a trial access to medication.
We think that even if you assigned this randomly it still arbitrarily punishes a few people, and that at the end of the day, we think medicine should be provided equally to all people whenever possible.
So our second point is about why we think this preferences scientific data over the obligations of medical personnel.
So, recognize that doctors in most countries around the world swear some version of the hippocratic oath, that they will do no harm.
And they have a legal obligation to do what is best for their patients.
Yet, in these randomized controlled trials, doctors are more concerned about getting scientific results to publishing journals, than they are with actually helping people.
They are knowingly denying treatment to ill individuals so that they can get higher quality of scientific research.
Now the other team is going to get up here and tell you that ultimately for the greater good, it's still better to have the scientific research that not to have it, and that you wouldn't be able to get the same quality of research without randomized controlled trials, but it's not immediately clear to me why this has to be the case.
It seems likely that if we didn't use these randomized controlled trials, that using things like simulations and other techniques, even if it costs a little bit more money, we could come up with other ways to test these drugs while still providing everyone access to the high quality of care that they deserve.
We think doctors are shirking their duties to their patients when they don't provide the best medical care possible, and that means giving access to drugs even if they're undergoing testing.
I think that a useful way to think about this might be that if you had a relative who had, god forbid, HIV aids, and you knew that there was a drug that could help this person prevent going prevent this person from going from HIV to aids, and they were in a study, you would always want that person to receive the drug, not to receive the placebo.
We don't think that anyone would ever opt into receiving a placebo because they wouldn't be receiving the type of care that they need in order to cure their disease.
So that point when nobody is choosing to get the placebo they're only running the risk of it because there's no other way to get treatment, we don't think that this is fair or just.
So ultimately we think randomized control trials bring more harm than good, because they unfairly deny treatment, and because they subvert the duties of doctors.
Thank you."
"We should fight global warming, because global warming is bad, very very bad, and many many people are going to die, if we don't do something about it.
Very bad.
So, let's talk about why.
First and foremost, cities are going to flood.
When science has like it's like essentially just a scientific fact that, if the world keeps getting warmer, concentrated glaciers, polar ice caps, all these things are going to melt.
When it melts, it goes into the ocean, and when it goes into the ocean, sea levels rise.
Now this is a problem, because if sea levels go up by say five feet or ten feet, the billions of people, that live along coasts, are going to be under water, and that's a problem, because people are not fish and they cannot breathe underwater, they cannot live underwater.
So, this means that either you're going to have to spend whole like massive amounts of money on creating levees around essentially like the entire world, around like global coastlines, you're also going to have to spend a lot of money on maintaining those kind of things, and the like.
I think that's probably just gonna be prohibitively expensive for most people around the world, except for maybe the richest cities.
The other possibility is that everyone's going to have to move, which is also kind of a waste, because you built the entire cities there, but it's also very difficult to move, it's costly to move, it's expensive to move, there's transition cost, so all that's bad as well.
But the additional thing is that, a lot of these problems are going to happen not not just like over time gradually, but they're going to happen suddenly.
So you're not going to be able to transition as well.
So, for example, maybe the sea levels are already going up a little bit more, and that means when a hurricane rolls around, a storm surge is going to be a whole lot worse, and you're more likely going to have mass flooding or things like that, or a levee crack, suddenly you're going to have like a bowl essentially fill up with water, which is awful, things like that.
This is also bad for global food supplies, most food can grow at the temperature that it's grown out for the entirety of human existence and natural existence, and if something gets five degrees warmer, or even two degrees warmer, food can't grow, and that's bad, because it's going to lead to mass starvation.
But similarly, to the last point, you're also going to see more volatility in global weather patterns, more natural disasters as a result of climate change, more unusual cold spells, more unusual hot spells, and things like that, and more extreme, so these are also just going to mess up crop production.
They're going to mess up the ability to actually feed people.
So, unless we plan on growing all of the global food supply inside greenhouses, which I don't think is in any way feasible, we should probably come with a solution to that, and fight global warming.
This is also going to be incredibly bad from just like a general health perspective, because even if like none of that is true, even if like none of those like massive existential consequences are true, as far as like that's concerned, they're still obvious consequences, like when you're releasing more CO two into the atmosphere, you are making it so that there is more air pollution, and that could create problems for like a lung health, and other kinds of health problems, which aren't good, and other kinds of things.
But I also think that, as far as moral responsibility is concerned, that we have responsibilities for these things, because maybe you could have like a moral discussion: okay, we know factually global warming is going to exist, but there's a problem with that, we'd have to spend a whole lot of money to fight global warming, we'd have to drastically change our lives in order to fight global warming.
So, first and foremost, it's worth incurring these harms, because these harms are the risks are existential in nature, and spending money, or living a harder life, or a more less like wasteful life, are things that are more important.
Second, a lot of things are easy fixes: recycle more, have smarter regulations in place, are all things that don't necessarily require all that much of a transition, but third, it's incredibly irresponsible to young people, it's incredibly irresponsible to the people who have to live with the actual consequences of global warming, not like your racist sixty year old grandpa.
So, for all those reasons, we should fight global warming."
"We should phase out disposable or thin plastic bags.
So, essentially, this is a debate about the type of bags that you might get at the corner store when you go pick something up: these very thin, flimsy plastic bags.
We think that they should be banned over time.
We the way we would do this is, first, by introducing a bag tax where you have to pay ten cents or something to get a bag and then gradually banning them altogether.
We have two main arguments for why we need to do this: the first is about pollution, and the second is about why we need to encourage the use of better alternatives.
So, pollution.
The problem with these bags is that they eventually end up in places you don't want them.
People throw them out and they go to dumps and then end up in the ocean, or people just leave them on the ground and they blow around and end up in the ocean, but either way these present a big problem for marine ecosystems.
One great example of this is the effect they have on sea turtles.
Everybody loves sea turtles.
One of the main foods for sea turtles are jellyfish.
That's one of the main things that they eat.
And if you think about what a jellyfish looks like underwater versus what a walmart bag looks like underwater, you can imagine how it's very confusing if you're a sea turtle.
You've got this little blob-shaped bag, and one of them is food and one of them will kill you.
So lots of sea turtles eat plastic bags, and these block their intestine or otherwise kill them.
So, as a result, these pose a big threat to the sea turtle population.
And while that's kind of a cute animal that we all love, these also have a negative effect on many other animals that eat jellyfish or that live in the ocean.
Similarly, this plastic can break up into tiny particles which have gone on to form this massive island of garbage we've all heard about in the pacific ocean, and that can then lead to big filter feeders like whales consuming the plastic and, again, getting cancer or experiencing blockages and dying as a result.
So it's clear that there's a massive effect that this has on marine ecosystems.
And I think that's probably sufficient reason to ban them right there: is that they have a very modest utility to us and a huge harm for these sea creatures and, plainly, we want to keep those creatures around so we need to do something, and that, in this case, means getting rid of plastic bags.
But our second argument is that if you ban plastic bags, you'll encourage the use of recyclable alternatives.
Right?
Almost every store is willing to give you a paper bag right now but people don't take them, because they're slightly less convenient than a plastic bag.
But the big difference for the environment is that it's very easy and cheap to recycle paper whereas it's actually impossible, I'm told, to recycle these plastic bags.
So we think that if we, first, discourage people from getting a plastic bag through a bag tax, like you see in many american cities today, and secondly, encourage them to get paper instead, because it's cheaper, and then ban the alternative, that everyone will switch over to recyclable bags.
This means that even if we can't get away from a culture that uses too many disposable bags, we can at least use a better disposable bag.
Now the other side might say in response to all this that, first of all, there are other sources of plastic that pose a problem for sea life, and that's true, but this is a pretty substantial contributor and, moreover, it's one that we can so easily get rid of that there's no reason not to.
And secondly, the other side might point out that people need to move away from disposable bags altogether and that this doesn't really solve the problem.
But it's much easier to get people to switch over to recyclable or biodegradable paper than it is to get them to stop expecting a bag everywhere altogether.
Yes, we should all be taking a reusable bag to the grocery store and, yes, we shouldn't use so much plastic and paper in our takeout food but, at the end of the day, that's the culture that we have, and it's easier to slightly reform that culture rather than expect it to completely change overnight.
For all of these reasons, we should ban the use of plastic bags.
Thank you."
"We should increase drug testing.
In fact, we think that every employer should have mandatory drug testing several times a year whereas right now most people only take a drug test to get hired at their job not after they've already gotten it unless they're a pro football player or something like that.
We have a couple of arguments for our side this evening, the first is that this would change drug policy.
Right now an enormous percentage of the population in the US and other western countries uses marijuana yet the public perception is that only poor black people and hippies use marijuana and this fuels the war on drugs because people think it's no one like them it's other people.
If it came out that tens of hundreds of millions of people in the west were using marijuana we think it be legalized much more quickly.
Ultimately if everybody realized that their next door neighbor was smoking pot once a week we think it's likely that they would realize that it's actually not dangerous and that we should let people do whatever they want as long as they don't hurt others.
But what's more there are probably a lot of people right now especially middle class white people who smoke marijuana sometimes but don't vote to legalize it because as long as it's illegal they don't really suffer they can just buy from a dealer and all of the harms of the war on drugs are limited to black men living in inner cities especially in but ultimately on this side suddenly everyone would have to bear the cost of the war on drugs you would have rich white people going to before a court being humiliated in public and maybe even going to jail instead of just young people of color and since that's obviously going to be unacceptable to the voters it's likely that drug policy will get changed really really quickly especially when like senators and congressmen and parliamentarians are being revealed as drug users.
So ultimately this could be the best tool possible to end the war on drugs even though it seems counter intuitive.
This will reveal to the public mores are completely out of step with the law and hopefully the law will catch up with the public mores very quickly.
This could save millions of people from going to jail in the next few years so we think that that would be more than worth the inconveniences that this would bring on initially.
And our second argument is that we think that this would lead to fewer deaths overall.
Many people who use drugs ultimately see there life go into a kind of downward spiral after they've been using drugs for a long time.
It's not like after the second time you spoke crystal meth you just tear off your shirt become a raving maniac instead you kind of have a slow decline.
If we could catch people near the beginning of that decline because we could tell this person's using drugs then we think it's likely that we can get people to help that they need.
The other side's going to say that this will just get drug users fired but we think it will get them into a rehab programs.
Once it becomes clear just how many people are using drugs like oxycontin like crystal meth we think it's likely that there will be more funding for rehab programs because everyone will realize that it's effecting their community and not just other people somewhere else.
As a result a few things will happen: one we think fewer people will overdose which will save lots of lives and let people get back to a productive life in society.
Second we think this will increase funding for rehab and sympathy towards these people so that they'll be treated as having a medical condition rather than a criminal problem.
Thirdly, we think that this will allow us to go after the people who are selling these drugs because once we know who the users are it'll be much easier to crack down on the drug dealers.
We think that this really weaken the position of drug cartels in particular since they rely on being able to sell their drugs with relatively anonymy anonymity and now we would have thousands of people that we could convince provide witness against them.
So ultimately because this changes the way we think about drug use and would have many beneficial applications to our drug policy, we should increase drug testing.
Thank you."
"A flat tax will bring more good than harm.
So I want to be very clear.
What we're talking about in this debate is what will ultimately be the best for the state, not for any given individual.
We think that ultimately when you talk about a tax policy, you have to think about the effect that it has on millions of people, not on any one person.
With that in mind, we're going to argue that the flat tax will be good on aggregate for everyone living in a liberal democracy, although obviously it's going to harm some individuals disproportionately.
Two big arguments, but before we get into that, a little bit of background.
We're going to say that this flat tax will only take effect over a certain level of income.
So say, your money up to under two hundred percent of the poverty line will not be taxed.
We're going to say that revenue it will be revenue neutral compared to the progressive income tax so in a country like the US where most people are paying twenty five to thirty percent income tax right now, you'll bring in the same amount of money with the flat tax.
That's a level that will set it at and we're also going to say that we're going to get rid of almost all tax credits, and that includes for corporations and capital gains tax.
So investors and corporations are also going to pay a flat tax, although at a different rate from personal income tax, and they're also going to lose out on income tax credits as well.
Two arguments for you then.
One is that we think this would shift the tax burden onto corporations and investors and off of the shoulders of individuals.
Why is this true?
First of all, if you simplify the tax code as we prefer propose to do who does that actually harm?
Right now the people who benefit from the complex tax code are corporations and investors who use loopholes to avoid paying any tax at all.
Companies like boeing declare bogus losses eventhough they're bringing in billions of dollars, investors are able to claim that they take a loss every third year to avoid paying any tax, things like that.
We're going to get rid of all of these loopholes, which means that the government's receipts are going to go way way up from corporations and investors, namely the wealthiest segments of society, those who actually have capital and wealth.
Whereas lower income people are going to be able to pay and relatively less first of all because of less of their money will be taxed.
All the money up to two hundred percent of the poverty line would go untaxed under our policy which would actually help those poorest.
They would pay less than they do in the status quo, but on top of that, we tell you that even middle income people would see that a larger burden of the state's financing would fall on the wealthy rather than on themselves.
So we think that not only would this be principally fair, but it would also shift the tax burden on to those who should bear a higher portion of the state's cost because they benefit from it disproportionately, namely the wealthy.
Our second argument is that we think that this would require much less bureaucracy and overhead.
Right now, for most countries, they have thousands of people working in bureaucracy in order to deal with complex tax codes.
The internal revenue service in the united states or IRS employs thousands of people, they have a huge building in washington DC, and it takes them basically all year to deal with the previous year's taxes.
If you have a flat tax then we think it's much easier to determine if people are actually paying what they should.
Of course we'll still have to do audits, but in general you'll be able to see that if someone pays x amount of money, you'll be able to compare it very quickly to a chart and know if they paid correctly, as opposed to right now where you have to go and look at every single exemption and credit that they qualify for.
What's more, you wouldn't have to oversee these income tax returns.
Right now people in countries like the US pay in too much and then they get a check back a few months later.
With the flat tax that wouldn't be necessary because individuals could actually calculate the correct amount that they need to pay.
So with these arguments in mind, because ultimately the flat tax would shift the tax burden, and because you would have so much less overhead that it would be more efficient, a flat tax will bring more good than harm.
Thank you."
"ADHD management brings more good than harm.
At the beginning of the debate, it's again crucial to recognize what we're talking about when we talk about ADHD management.
We don't think that ADHD management necessarily means that people are being forced to take drugs at a high level that people are being put on prescription drugs at very young ages, though these things are often part of the type of prevention and management that we're talking about, we think that there are, that this is not a necessary part of a DHD management but rather something that in an ideal world could be legislated in order to ensure that abuse of prescription doesn't occur.
But we don't think that abuse of prescription is a necessary part of ADHD management, nor do we think that it is an overwhelming part of ADHD management in the status quo.
Rather, what we think ADHD management does, is it allows children to get a head start on their future and allows them to manage their education and things like this in a much more robust way, that actually sets a foundation for them moving forward.
When we're talking about ADHD management, where often talking about children age six through eighteen, children who are at a place in their lives where their education and their ability to focus specifically is is incredibly important.
Why is this the case?
We think that the education you receive at the beginning of your life, often, is the most important time of development and setting success for a person's future.
We think that education is the key to social mobility, and that education is hampered by the inability of people with ADHD to focus on their studies.
Recognizing that ADHD is not a flaw of someone in a moral sense, or a flaw of someone in how they are, we think that just in our society in the status quo, it is often difficult for individuals who are growing up with many types of stimuli, to actually focus when they enter their educational systems.
What this means is that ADHD management provides a path to ensure that in an incredibly distracting and increasingly distracting world, individuals, when they enter their classrooms, are able to focus on the education at hand.
Why is this crucial?
Because, firstly, when individuals are not able to get this education, it's incredibly difficult for them to succeed in moving into the future.
It's hard to get a college education, it's hard to get vocational training, it's hard to get access to different internships and other pathways to success in the future if you don't have foundational education starting in the k through twelve level.
That's why we think that, especially in this phase which is where ADHD management is most prevalent, we think that this is an especially crucial time for children to be able to get this benefit.
But, what is the comparative in this debate?
We think that without ADHD management, certainly ADHD does not go away.
The problems of children being hyperactive and not being able to pay attention in their classrooms, is a problem that's going to happen regardless.
What we think happens when you don't have large scale ADHD management programs, programs that allow children to succeed in that classroom, is that parents start to get angry at their children.
Their parents start to look at their children and wonder why they're not able to be successful.
They treat this not as an issue of mental health, but rather as a moral issue that their children are simply not living up to the moral standards of being a functioning person in society.
When that happens, we think that children suffer additionally, because not only are they not able to get the education they need in school, but additionally they're not able to get support at home, they're not able to get understanding from their parents, and it makes the trial and tribulation that they go through increasingly more difficult.
When firstly you're in school, struggling to be able to focus, when that is compounded with parents telling you that you are to blame for not being able to focus, when your parents are telling you that something's wrong with you, we think that that makes education and overall the child's life much more difficult, and we think that this is the most likely comparative if you don't have a treatment program.
Because, children are still going to struggle in school, especially those with ADHD, and without some sort of broad scaling management program, we think the most likely alternative is that parents start to grow frustrated with their children, rather thann grow more accepting of the fact that their children are going to be the way they are.
Given that this is the case, we think that ADHD management certainly brings more good than harm."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should make physical education mandatory.
Some modeling: we think we're talking primarily about american high schools and middle schools and what we would mean is that we would have one physical education class per year, mandatory for a student to take.
Two main areas of clash: first about the fight against obesity.
In order to understand this motion we think you have to understand how big of a problem obesity is within the united states.
Not only does it affect millions of people, but it is also one of the fastest rising conditions to affect individuals in a deadly manner that is occurring.
Its it's thought to be the largest cause of death in that all of the diseases that stem from obesity tend to be deadly.
It causes increased rates of heart heart attacks, diabetes, heart disease and other such conditions, that can often be incredibly deadly and long term harmful.
And while it's very bad for the individuals, it's also very bad for the government and society, when you have to increase healthcare costs because everyone is overweight and thus more susceptible to diseases.
And so we actually think that not only is there a reason that we should fight obesity on a personal level, but also a reason that the government has a permanent interest to fight obesity itself.
We also think it's important to note that obesity often starts by affecting children.
They're surrounded by junk food and they don't really have a pressure to exercise, external to those who are involved in athletics.
So like say I'm just someone who isn't into group sports our team sports at school and after that there's really no good reason for me to go out and exercise, unless I'm provided with a structured schedule that forces me to, because kids are naturally lazy and don't really feel like doing things.
As such, we think you need to start fighting obesity at the start.
You need to teach children to have good habits now so that they can avoid obesity later or even currently.
Physical education provides healthy touchstones as well as someone that they can go back to with questions.
Like you provide a adult authority figure that if a person has a question about their body, about a physical fitness plan, about the food that they're eating, they can go to them.
We think that if you start educating kids young then you can cut that obesity epidemic in half.
Because at the point that part of the reason that people and gain a lot of weight when they get older is that they don't know how to maintain healthy habits and healthy exercise mannerisms.
We thing that if you just teach them early enough then you're going to be preparing them for the future.
Our second area of clash is about teaching kids to know their bodies.
Because as bad as it is for society, it's also incredibly bad for the individual.
You feel unhealthy, you're more susceptible to diseases, you're probably getting bullied in school, because children are awful, and you're not being able to participate in the same activities that a lot of your peers are, IE those who have obesity issues also tend to have higher rates of asthma, they generally usually can't keep up with kids who are more physically fit than them another such we think that you can easily avoid this and you ought be avoiding this by teaching them these healthy habits early.
Because just like any kind of habit, we think that exercise is and a healthy lifestyle is taught or you never gain it in the first place.
So just like I need to be taught math and it needs to stick in my head early on, or the best time in my life to learn a language is when I'm very young, we think that healthy lifestyles are exactly the same way.
And we also think of these habits are much easier to teach when you're young than when you're old because once you've grown up you've already developed your own routines, your own meal habits, and you're already addicted to certain food groups that are going to be very hard for you to break out of.
And it's also a lot harder to lose weight than to just keep that weight off in the first place.
And so we actually think that if you just teach people when they're young they're much more likely to maintain these these habits into their older age.
They're much more likely to feel more in control of their body and have less issues with confidence and other emotional issues that can also stem from being obese.
And as such we think that you ought make physical education mandatory in schools."
"We should disband nato.
So, the north atlantic treaty organization is a military alliance between a group of global north countries like the US, britain,france, canada, and other countries in europe.
We want to disband it for three reasons.
The first, is that it has served its purpose.
Nato was created to protect europe from the soviet union.
Which obviously isn't around today and doesn't pose a risk anymore.
We see that nato was probably very necessary at a time when you had thousands of soviet tanks in east germany, germany was a divided country, there was a lot of concern about war, the americans and the russians both wanted to put nuclear weapons in europe and that needed be moderated in some way.
At that time, there was an urgent need for the countries of the global north, these first world countries, to work together to protect each other from communism, and to structure their alliance in such a way that all of the countries could participate in it on some sort of equal footing.
But at the point where nato was created in reaction to the soviet threat and the soviet union has been gone since before I was born, it really seems like the alliance has run its course.
Our second point is that we think nato was unnecessarily threatening to russia.
So remember that nato was founded explicitly to be anti soviet, and that russia has taken on most of the responsibilities and duties of the soviet union in the international sphere.
So what you have now is a country that's much weaker than the soviet union, russia has nothing approaching that kind of military power or influence, but which faces the exact same military alliance.
It's almost as though you have an eight hundred pound gorilla in the form of nato, and instead of having another gorilla in the form of the warsaw pact and the soviet union, you just have a guy going up against it.
We think that the russians with good reason feel threatened by the presence of american nuclear weapons only a couple hundred miles from their border, by the presence of thousands and thousands of american troops in germany, ultimately it's very clear that nato members use russaphobic language as a unifying factor and they drill and practice for attacks against russia and defending against russian attacks and otherwise basically the alliance puts russian leaders in a position where one, they can sell the threat of nato invasion or the threat of nato attacks, to maintain their own power and undermine democracy in their country.
And two, where they have very legitimate concerns about the kind of weapons that are being deployed around their borders.
It's probably true that most of the fears that people like vladimir putin claim to have are just a way to get support from the public, but there is some legitimate concern about having an enemy alliance on your doorstep with nuclear weapons that exist solely to contain your country's interests.
This threat to russia's only bad for world peace and we think that getting rid of nato would do a lot to restore goodwill between russia and europe.
Our third argument is that nato was an unfair alliance.
This is for a couple reasons.
On a financial level, almost no countries in nato actually pay as much as they're supposed to into the common defense.
We see that the united states picks up the vast majority of the tab while most european countries basically have no military.
They're free riding on the back of this alliance and getting away with not defending themselves making the american taxpayer pay for it.
We think it's unfair that americans have to pay to defend swedes and other people who aren't doing their fair share.
But on top of that, we think nato is also unfair in the other direction, because the US has such outsized control on it.
Although nato is nominally an alliance of equals, in practice the US dictates what nato is going to do, drags nato members into conflicts and proxy wars, and ultimately is able to use it I to almost keep the europeans as satellite states, sort of analogous to the old warsaw pact in eastern europe.
And it seems true that the countries with the most independence are those with the largest militaries like britain or france, while smaller countries with weaker militaries have less independence.
So we think that at the end of the day, nato was an unfair alliance to both the wealthier members who pay more than their fair share, and to the smaller members who were suffer the dictates of the united states.
So for these reasons, because it's served its purpose, because it undermines peace with russia, and because it's an unfair alliance, we should disband nato.
Thank you."
"We should adopt slow food.
I think what we mean by this is that we would prefer it if there was a general trend within society that individuals opted for slow food, IE that which is like defined by traditional slow food, so those that are culturally significant to your region, farmed in a environmentally friendly, and friendly to your workers kind of manner, and oftentimes are made up of ingredients that are local and you can read the names of all of them, and so on so forth.
So three independent points.
First, on why it is physically healthier.
Recognize first and foremost that slow food is all about doing the opposite of what fast food is.
So you're not using mass production of using pesticides or chemicals, you are lowering the amount of frying that is happening, you're making sure to cook it in a preferable manner, you're using ingredients that you know where their source from, they're usually local.
And what this means is that it is oftentimes a lot better for your body than the alternative.
Because recognize that fast food, and honestly a lot of the food that we eat that is pre-made, is oftentimes absurdly processed, and we actually have no idea what is inside that food or how it can impact our bodies.
So it is really important for us to take a step back and do something like slow food, and recognize that this is something that is just healthier for us, it is less likely to increase our cholesterol, or increase our risk for diabetes or heart disease, which we think is very positive.
But we also think that people who eat better personally feel better, like you feel like a healthier person.
It's less likely that you wake up in the morning and you like don't feel like you can function, you have more energy, you're more likely to have a better sleep cycle.
And all of these things lead to like a better feeling of self-esteem and personal like emotions, which we think is very positive for people, especially in a world where we're so used to that kind of gross feeling of overeating, even though we've only had one burger, but you know it's had like sixteen hundred calories in it because of the oil that they use, or something similar.
The control that it allows us over our food, over what enters our body, is something that is crucial to maintaining physical well-being.
Our second argument is about being regionally respectful.
Recognize that when you have slow food, it is performed and it is prepared using cultural cuisine and ingredients, and in that it like pays homage to the region.
So the way that slow food was essentially founded is that in italy they were trying to build some large corporate mcdonald's or something in like a very culturally diverse area, and what the people did instead was embrace the local penne.
And that's something that is very important, right?
Like recognizing that regardless of globalization, regardless of the fact that there are all these corporations rushing into your favorite areas and rushing into your hometown, you maintain that like cultural line to your local culture and your local traditions.
Recognize also that these are often the same kind of traditions that are at risk of dying out with the push for things like assimilation.
So we think it becomes even more important to make sure that these tiny traditions, that are so valuable to individuals who practice them and have this inherent cultural value, continue to exist.
It also just pays attention to the working condition a lot better, which means that the workers are more likely to be treated well, more likely to be perry paid fairly.
But also it means that when you are importing food from other areas, you're making sure that the individuals who originally made that food are being compensated fairly.
Like we have massive issues right now with like coffee beans or where the production line is so separated from the source, that they don't see the product if they don't see the profits from that product, which is incredibly problematic.
Our third argument is about environmental friendliness.
We think that when you're creating food on smaller farms, when you're making sure you're not deforesting to mass produce, these are all things that impact the environment in positive manners.
Proud to propose."
"We should abandon voter registration.
I think the modeling here is really important.
Because by no means are we just creating a system in which there is no holds barred on voting, anyone can just walk in drop their vote and walk out.
We think we obviously recognize the importance of tracking the identity and the citizenship of an individual who comes in to vote we just object to the idea that they have to go through a process weeks in advance that registers them and checks all of these different kinds of ID's, which if they don't have is likely to prevent them from voting at all.
We think that that is very different from just checking someone's name, checking someone's driver's license as they come in through the through the door to vote on like the actual poll day.
So we think in the status quo the problem is that voting registration is being done weeks in advance in uncomfortable timing, it's asking for mass amounts of proof of who you are beyond just your social security number and perhaps like a state ID.
It's asking for things like your passport, it's asking for birth certificates and things like that.
We think that's really problematic and oftentimes just used to prevent individuals from being able to be democratically involved.
To main arguments, first on increasing access to voting just generally.
Like a lot of people just don't have time to do the process of voter registration and we think this is no and we think this is just equivalent to just straight up attempts to prevent democracy on the parts of the group that facilitate and like and advocate for voter registration, because they're literally saying that your citizenship is not enough to be a voter, you have to prove it in all of these different ways.
And they purposefully make the process long and arduous.
Like we just think it's really problematic that in order to get an out of state ballot your registration has to go through like six different bureaucratic methods.
This is just a way of preventing individuals from participating in the process that determines the country's outcome.
We think this is really problematic, first in terms of an identity obligation.
As the united states you are literally founded on the principle that individuals are going to choose their government.
But when you have things like voter registration it affects certain individuals more than others.
What this means is that there are going to be people who have a really easy time going through voter registration because all of their documents are on hand, because their job doesn't go super late, because they know, they are educated about when these kinds of things occur, verses populations that tend to be more poor, which intersects a lot of the time with people of color in the united states who don't have the time, who aren't paying as much attention because they physically cannot.
And we think that's really problematic.
And we think also that there's just a like physical outcome kind of obligation in that it is always better to have a country where the majority of individuals have selected their leader.
First because those people are actually going to be okay with living in that country.
They're going to be more productive members of society when they feel when they feel like they've participated and aren't feeling apathetic about the public political process because they've been blocked out of it.
But second because we think when you get like violence and social uprising is when individuals feel like they've been blocked from the process.
So we think that the you're just more likely to have instability and coups and things like that if you have things like voter registration and people feel like they're not being heard by the general like political sphere.
Our second argument is about preventing based discrimination.
Historically and in the status quo this is been done voter registration has been used to prevent black people from voting, to prevent women from voting.
We think just because of the fact that harkens back to those kinds of times it reminds individuals of that, we think that's a really bad PR like PR essentially.
We think that people are just uncomfortable with the concept and are more likely to have bad thoughts about the government and bad thoughts about the general like political activity if that happens.
And this overflows.
Right?
Like it means that people don't do things like donate to political spheres, it means they don't do things like read the news because they feel disengaged from that.
So you have an infinitely less informed and infinitely less active populace.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should further exploit sustainable energies.
By we, we would mean any given government.
We think this is a good idea for any of them and we would just say like this could come in the form of putting more money into those like fields, subsidizing scientists who are willing to work on that, opening government departments, etcetera.
Like any method by which we actually use sustainable energies and encourage the use of sustainable energy.
With that, three main areas of clash, first on why it is a or two main areas of clash first and why it is a necessity both physically and environmentally.
But physically, recognize that we are running out of fossil fuels.
We're using them up at a faster rate than they are created and moreover, humans are multiplying at an alarming rate in and which makes it impossible to supply it to so many.
This especially becomes true even with invention of things like fracking, as developing countries become developed and spread electricity wider across countries that previously didn't have it.
So even if we're okay for now with like developed countries as they stand, insofar as like large portions of africa are starting to develop, like large portions of the middle east like etcetera etcetera, we think that it becomes infinitely more important that we start to be sustainable.
Because we're about to add double, triple the load of what we are currently using on earth.
Recognize also that sustainable energies solve this problem because they often overlap with renewable sources.
That can more cheaply and efficiently provide power to large amounts of people.
Like at the end of the day if we start doing things like exploiting the fact that it never gets dark in certain regions of the world and using solar panels there, or exploiting the fact that at really high altitudes it's almost always windy, we can do things like put large amounts of windmills up or exploit river currents to power using water.
Like these things are all within our grasp.
The problem is that we haven't chosen to exploit them yet.
But also and and recognize that they can supply infinitely more people insofar as like oil has this like given boom for the buck, but if you're able to set up large amounts of windmills large amounts of water turner's, than all of this becomes a multiplier by which we can support more and more people.
But also recognize that's an environmental necessity.
When people say we are about to reach the ultimate heat death of the universe this is not a lie.
Recognize that global warming is a very real threat that continues as we burn more and more fossil fuels and they produce more and more methane and other toxic gases.
So we need to solve this before something like literally death of the universe occurs.
And the only way that we can do that is by doing things like relying on sustainable energies and encouraging entire populations to switch to it.
Like recognize that these kinds of changes don't happen over night.
Especially in a world where we've primed large oil dealers and large oil companies to have monopolies on energy to lobby our government's etcetera.
The only way that we get over it had self imposed hump where they have the majority of the power, is to take some of that power away and give it to companies that will produce sustainable energies.
But our second area of clash is about how it's good for the economy.
This happens in a couple of ways: first in that it's just like creates jobs.
Like by virtue of being a new field of energy, by virtue of having to have factories that push out these that push out more and more of these products, like even if we're just creating windmills, even if we're just doing all that, like that creates factory jobs like blue collar jobs.
But also jobs in more higher up sectors.
Like we have more and more people entering stem fields than ever, and one of the things that they can do is go and work on these kinds of technologies.
So in in countries that often have large unemployment rates this would be especially beneficial because we take some of that population and put them into this.
But also recognize that research in general is really good for the economy insofar as it can do things that create niches that you can trade with other countries.
So if the US is capable of becoming a like a group that has access to research and development that other countries don't, then they can more quickly develop the goods that will become more desired as they become cheaper and more necessary in the way that sustainable energies are.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should end affirmative action.
Two main areas of clash: first about political backlash.
I think it's really important to understand the ways in which affirmative action gets framed in political rhetoric.
Because very few individuals actually recognize that affirmative action is something that facilitates an adjustment to previous inequalities that no one could control, or were often created by people who were white and more privileged.
But the way in which politicians do you construe it and the way in which a lot of white people see it is that it's become massively synonymous with cutting people of color slack, like lowering the academic bar to make it easier for people who couldn't achieve it on their own.
It seen as disenfranchising those who are more deserving and like seen as reverse racism, like white people are now being discriminated against.
These things are obviously not true, but it doesn't change politicians' and change individuals who might be less educated minds about using this kind of rhetoric or believing in these kinds of ways.
And as such a lot of people really resent this policy.
They see it as an addition to a list of things that people of color want as handouts rather than working hard for themselves.
Like the conflation of people of color with things like welfare has been massively detrimental in allowing individuals to see these kinds of policies as necessary.
Rather they see themselves as individuals who have pulled themselves up by their bootstraps and then don't understand why people of color or minority groups can't do the same.
This resentment presents a massive rallying force in that a lot of the times politicians will use this to get people on the margins.
Like: "" look, you didn't believe in us before but now that you see that you're being treated so unfairly and you're being discriminated against us, you should be voting for us. ""
So we think this actually loses democrats a lot of potential political capital, which is really problematic.
But there's also a really problematic outcome in that it actually affects public policy.
Like it's really hard to pass other things that might benefit people of color into the long term because it's seen as extra handouts.
Like doing things like allowing unemployment to last for longer or making sure that like there's well funded support for welfare or food stamps, all becomes a lot harder when it seen as added to a list of potential handouts.
And we just think it's a lot more important to make sure that people have their fundamental rights fulfilled and fundamental needs fulfilled first, like make sure you're not starving and not homeless, before we do things like work with like college education.
Our second area of clash is why it's bad for individual students.
First we think it sends a really bad message to anyone who is a person of color at an elite institution.
It's associated with this idea that the only reason you're there is due to affirmative action or the color of your skin and it creates a never ending expectation and requirement to prove that you deserve to be there, because everyone else sees you as undeserving or less deserving.
And so we think that that is actually a really damaging way for individuals to live their lives.
Like we don't think they should be under this constant pressure.
And we think that they should have a certain amount of control over their own lives and that they aren't just like puppets who couldn't control their own situations and got there through other people's hard work.
And I think that this is something that can be really hard on your own self esteem but can also really be really hard on you mentally because everyone is going to fail sometimes.
There's never going to be a world in which you live up to every single person's expectation.
But when that expectation is tied to the entire like the rest of your racial group we that's really bad.
Like at the point that one black student doing poorly on an exam or failing out of college is a like mandate against all people of color, that's just too much to put on one individual.
We also think though that it affects how other people treat or think of them.
Like other students.
We think that you end up being treated more poorly because it's seen as a trade off between benefits for you or them.
A lot of the time students end up excluded or abused by other students because they're seen as people who are deserving to be there or they're automatically assumed to be stupider than them.
And we think that when you remove affirmative action it basically mandates that every single person within that context is someone who made it their of their own hard work and of their own free will.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should abolish attorney client privilege.
So the over arching argument that we're going to make in this round is that the purpose of the justice system should be defined truth above all else above above ensuring that defendants have an absolute right to defend themselves, but they have all the protections that are guaranteed to them.
We think that truth should be the priority of the justice system.
So why is this the case?
Let us outline that and let us outline why you cannot allow attorney client privilege under this justification.
So when a crime has been committed the state we think should prioritize finding the truth and rendering a verdict in line with the facts because when a crime has been committed the the there are three actors that need to be considered the defendant, the victim, and of course society who has suffered a harm as a proxy of the as a proxy of the victim.
We think that people trust the justice system when it shows a vigorous devotion to the truth when it doesn't allow certain people to hide behind fancy lawyers and fancy attorneys while other people are thrown into jail without the same type of privilege and recognize that attorney client privilege is a disparate privilege.
There's a disparity in quality of lawyers in the status quo which means that that privilege is most beneficial to those with money, to those that can afford to have a dedicated attorney that's going to take their case, that's going to build their defense for them where as many people that enter the justice system go through go through a system with public defenders where they have maybe fifteen minutes with the public defender before they go into a court, before they have to enter a plea.
This means that this type of privilege is massively disparate and in the eyes of many people shows the skewing of the justice system in favor of the rich and in favor of the powerful and just because this is how common law has worked, this doesn't mean that it's suddenly just just that's this is an is a fallacy to believe that because this is the way that this has always been done that it must continue to be done this way.
We think it's important to uphold the right of the defendant but recognize that attorney client privilege insures that someone can tell their attorney yes, I'm guilty, I did this.
I acted in a way that violated the law and if you were to reveal that information to anyone else that person could be subpoenaed and you could be brought and that person could be brought forward in court and have to tell people and have to tell the jury that you told them this information.
Just because someone is your attorney doesn't mean that you should be able to reveal that information and if you are guilty there is the victim that should be considered as more important than your ability to try and hide from the truth, hide the truth from the justice system.
We think that in those instances the victim outweighs the outweighs the offender and and their need for some sort of closure, their need for some sort of punishment outweighs the defendant's ability to simply tell their attorney yes, without any shadow of a doubt, I did it.
We would also say that you can still plan a valid defense without this type of privilege.
You can get information that shows innocence.
You don't have to disclose if some if you are guilty if you are a client in this situation and if you are guilty, if there's evidence that you are guilty, the prosecution would need to disclose that evidence to the defense anyway which means that the defense can still plan their whole case knowing full well that you are guilty and try to build up a defense as to why you still shouldn't be put in jail or to try and obscure those facts.
You still have a full ability to mount a robust defense without this type of privilege.
It's just the way that you're going to go about forming that defense changes.
But like we said, when you prioritize truth above all else in the justice system, people have more faith in the justice system.
The justice system is dramatically less skewed towards those that have the financial ability to hide the truth far easier than those without the financial ability to do so and you get a system in which victims and those that have been the victim of crime are more likely to find justice.
For these reasons, we should abolish the attorney client privilege."
"We should introduce a smoking ban.
By this we mean that we should ban smoking completely in our cities.
We think that there are many reasons why this is the case but primarily it has to do with the obligation of the government to protect its citizens.
So in this speech I'm going to talk a lot about paternalism and why it applies in this instance.
So first of all, let's talk about secondhand smoke.
We think that the most important time for the government to limit individual's freedom is when an individual is harming a third party.
So it's one thing to let people destroy their own lives, although we'll talk about that in just a minute, but secondhand smoke can actually give people who don't smoke themselves lung cancer and this has been an increasingly large problem in the past especially with children growing up around parents that smoke.
We think it's clear that the government needs to step in when an individual's freedom is being violated and given that we assume people have a right to bodily autonomy and to good health, it's clear that the rights of someone who gets cancer from secondhand smoke or gets ill from secondhand smoke are being violated by the person who is smoking their cigarettes.
A useful metaphor to think about here is that your right to swing your fist ends where another person's face begins.
Well here your right to choose what you put in consume in your body ultimately ends when what you consumer or what you put in your body harms other people.
Now the other side might say that people can smoke in their apartment or in their house and not hurt anyone else, but the fact of the matter remains that nobody actually smokes in that way.
Everyone who goes out and goes to bars or has a job is going to have to smoke away from their house and that means that cigarette smoke is going to be exposed to people who don't smoke and who don't want to get cancer but are being affected by it through no fault of their own.
We think that this is a pretty compelling case for why the government needs to get involved to ban smoking and our second argument is about why the government should limit what individuals are allowed to do for their own sake.
We posit that no rational individual would choose to smoke in other words, if someone just sat down and tried to make a decision no one would ever choose to smoke.
People only begin because of outside pressure or because they're not able to make a good decision.
I think this is why if you ask people when did you start smoking a lot of people that I know and probably that you know as well say they started smoking because they were drinking and they started smoking whenever they would drink and then gradually they started smoking more and more when they weren't drinking until eventually they became a smoker and what we can take away from this is that one of the most common pathways for someone to become a smoker is to be unable to make a good decision because they're drunk and then to be put in an environment where lots of people are smoking like a bar.
We think that the government needs to intervene to protect people from themselves when they can't make a good decision.
In the same way that we don't let drunk people enter into contracts or make permanent decisions that affect their lives, we also probably shouldn't let them make a decision that affects their lives forever like becoming addicted to nicotine and the other side might say well plenty of people smoke who don't drink but those people probably live in cultures where cigarette smoking is normal and where there's a cultural pressure on them to smoke.
So even though smoking is very common in egypt and relatively few people drink for religious reasons, it's also a culture that encourages people to smoke that doesn't exist as much in the united states.
But we still think that that's coercive, right?
That if people are being pressured by their family and their friends to do something unhealthy, that they're not really able to make an unbiased decision but rather an emotional one.
So we think that people are being coerced or are being put into a position where they can't freely choose and therefore that it's justified for the government to get involved and to limit individual's freedom.
So for these two reasons, we should introduce a smoking ban because of the harms to individuals and to third parties.
Thank you."
"Carbon tax is incredibly good.
It's an effective way to raise revenue, fight global warming, and ultimately extract money from people who are morally responsible for a lot of the harms in the first place.
So why is a carbon tax necessary at a most basic level?
Because climate change is a huge problem.
Climate change is going to cause massive economic harms and massive human harms whether it's widespread flooding from natural disasters or rising sea levels, whether it's crop failures from widely varying temperatures and an inability of most crops to adjust, whether it's things like air quality in san francisco being so bad because of wildfires happening in the area unlike air being stuck and like it's not just san francisco but all throughout the pacific northwest, or things like that.
There's a whole slew of problems that come as a result of climate change and all of these problems result in human and economic harms.
So that's important because what you need to do then is try to raise money to combat all of these multi billion dollar probably multi trillion dollar harms because when you need to build a seawall around the entire city of miami, or you need to rebuild an entire city because it's now like practically under water, all of these things come with like huge huge damages and that's something that we can raise more revenue from with a carbon tax.
So at the most basic level you're obviously going to now have more money to combat the impacts of climate change if you have a carbon tax in place.
But it's also good because carbon tax is going to disincentivize behavior that leads to a lot of these problems in the first place.
Corporations are pretty greedy.
Corporations don't want to spend money for no reason so they're probably going to be more willing to invest a bit of money in transitioning towards green technology and therefore avoiding having to pay taxes that are going to progressively go up and up as the pool of as like carbon taxes tend to likely get more and more expensive over time.
So all that's going to be good but the next thing that I want to talk about is this is entirely good to do because the corporations that release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are are entirely to blame for not entirely but mostly the blame for global warming anyway and therefore should receive a lot of the blame.
For anyone who read who has read things like the LA times investigative journal reports into exxon mobil and their practices regarding climate change you get a pretty like dismal idea of the fact that a lot of corporations did incredibly advanced research in climate change, knew that it was happening, and there and even did and even altered their practices.
So in the case of exxon mobil, exxon mobil had extensive research from its own professionals that climate change was happening and it even did things like build its oil rigs higher off the higher off of like sea surfaces and designed them in such ways to deal with things like rising sea levels and different climate change conditions.
And yet on the flip side it would also spend tons of money funnel tons of money into anti climate change political candidates and to climate change denial and things like that as a public stance.
And corporations have been for time and time again trying to get around this.
It's a lot it's the same thing that like big tobacco did basically, where they would for years know that these things are really problematic but see that this is an economic cost for them and that they can keep trying to make a little bit more money off of the off of the current system that is in place, so they try to hide the truth.
And I think that that's something that happened on a pretty like widespread and systematic basis.
All energy because when you're talking about like people who release greenhouse gases and are going to be most affected by this tax, you're talking about oil companies, you're talking about gas companies, you're talking about heavy manufacturers, you're talking about people who polluted groundwater, you're not talking about these like benevolent actors who are just getting fined for no reason, you're talking about people who should be honestly lucky that all they're getting is taxed when this is what's happening here.
But additionally this is honestly a pretty reasonable way to officially allocate things because the more you pollute, the more harm and damage you're causing on a social level, so you should probably be the one that's paying for that.
So for all those reasons we're very proud to propose a carbon tax."
"We should introduce universal health care.
It is unacceptable that we live in such a wealthy state and yet individuals die of preventable diseases on a daily basis.
Individuals go without effective healthcare simply because of the lottery of birth and the situation that they were forced into.
Because poverty should not be a criminal sentence, because we should not pass morality because someone lives in poverty, it is very clear that we should pass universal healthcare.
This model be fairly simple.
We will adopt a european model where there's a single payer system.
All individuals will pay a higher rate of taxation particularly at the upper echelons of our society and that money will be used to pay for healthcare needs for all individuals.
Doctor's wages may decrease somewhat but they'll only decrease by at most about ten percent and their entire wages, the payment to hospitals, will all be done by these sort this universal healthcare system.
We would also say that insurance companies will be abolished so individuals will pay less on their insurance premiums as well.
First off, on how we can pay for this second, on why government has an obligation to provide this and third, on the advantages this has for society.
We believe that it would be very easy to fund this kind of system.
The vast majority of individuals in the united states already pay insurance which cost them massive amounts per year.
These insurance companies need to have make a profit every single year and as such, they're able to gouge the individuals who they serve and are actually required to charge a higher rate than their these individuals medical costs in order for them to actually continue to offer their insurance services.
Government is different.
Government does not need to run a surplus.
They can run at zero profitability or negative profitability through this kind of tax system.
This means it would be very easy for government to pay for this sort of system without actually losing any of the quality which comes from our healthcare system in the status quo.
My second argument is about government obligation.
We believe that government has an obligation to provide essential services.
They provide things like police and firefighters because private industry always fails at this.
Why do we see this?
First, these private industries can go under.
This means that they are if they fail, if a hospital fails, if your insurance company fails, it is very likely and possible that you will suffer massive damages as a result of this kind of policy.
Although the individual is unlikely to be massively harmed as a result of a company going under, the fringe cases, the edge cases where someone has a massive amount of medical bills and then their company simply cannot pay for it, can lead to essentially a lost life.
Someone who has to pay off their bills for the rest of their life and can never actually move up in society.
Second, we think that the government cannot gouge individuals.
Having a system where it is free rather than a system in which insurance companies charge exuberant prices because all individuals need healthcare to survive means that individuals will feel more comfortable and the system will be more efficient overall.
It is unclear why people in poverty to not deserve some part of healthcare given that poverty is largely a condition of someone's birth or social statuses and and social pressures which push them into things like drugs, alcohol, or crime.
My third argument is about how there are mass advantages to all individuals.
So at the point where we can pay for this, at the point where the government has an obligation to provide it, it is incredibly clear that we should do it but at the point where there are also advantages to the whole of society, it becomes obvious that we should introduce universal health care.
So first, we believe that there are returns to scale in the healthcare industry.
When you can pay for databases, when you can pay for medical studies, you it serves to be a larger institution which provides health care.
At the point where you can transfer doctors from hospital to hospital based on their need and specialization, you can also get better care for all individuals.
By linking every hospital and doctor together, government can save money while providing better forms of healthcare.
Secondly, if individuals can access preventative care, if they don't need to go to the hospital when a cancer is at a fatal level and simply just starting to develop, this means that individuals will largely pay less healthcare costs in the long term.
Will mean that all individuals will save on healthcare.
For this reason, we should introduce universal health care."
"We should ban beauty contests.
To an innocent bystander that has never in his life heard of beauty contests or knew of their existence and will accidentally just happen to stumble upon such an event taking place, this will seem more or less like this: a bunch of young and way-too-skinny girls dancing around half naked in front of cameras and in in front of a panel, that consists mostly of men that will later grade them and rank them based on their appearance alone and will award the winner with a small tiara.
We do not understand how such a thing can still take place in two thousand and seventeen.
We don't see literally any unique advantage or any good thing that comes out of these contests and the harms, on the other hand, to women's effort to be taken seriously and to overcome the sexism that so many women are still suffering from in society are humongous.
So I'm going to focus on two of these harms.
Firstly, on objectification and its implications on sexual harassment.
So, there's no way around this.
Beauty pageants are a clear form of objectification.
We think that we need to recognize that objectification remains one of the more serious problems that women deal with in society today.
The struggle for formal equality that started with the suffragettes is all but concluded.
Sure, there are still issues with employment and equal pay, but the data points to an ongoing trend of improvement.
There are more women in higher education institutes than men today, more and more women politicians are being elected to lead governments, with the unfortunate exception of the united states, but and so on and so on.
But what remains pretty much constant, or even maybe like becomes worse with time, is the amount of cases of sexual harassment towards women.
Now, true enough, this is probably due to the fact that more and more women today decide to come out and talk about this, and not due to it being like worse than it used to be.
But still, we can see that in this front, there's clearly still a very long way to go until we can say that this is a problem that belongs to the pages of history.
So we believe that this thing is directly related to the fact that it's still perceived as legitimate and perfectly normal to treat women as mere objects in a way that cannot be said that is true to men as well.
If society makes men understand that the most important thing about a woman is whether she's physically attractive or not, then it's going to be incredibly hard for them to see past that.
And that's exactly what's going on when they watch this glamorous ceremony that deals with rating women's looks.
The more this immediate link between seeing a woman and feeling physically attracted gets stronger, the harder it gets to control your impulses, on one hand, and the less you care about this woman's feelings and and like having respect towards her on the other hand, because after all this is just an object, right, that's meant to amuse me.
And so we get sexual harassments.
Second argument is about strengthening the model of beauty.
So we think that the model of beauty is a particularly ugly thing, pun intended.
It's being infiltrated into our consciousness, subliminally, without paying attention, through commercials, through hollywood movies, and in a very blunt and direct way through beauty contests.
It sets incredibly high and unreasonable standards for women to meet and leaves behind it a trail of scarred women for no good reason and to no fault of their own.
Women who see bees contests also internalize the message and understand that in order to be successful or or happy, they should, first of all, always focus on their exterior.
This thing harms all women.
Those who weren't blessed with the physique or the bone structure or the skin color of supermodels are forced to carry around this sense of inferiority, sometimes even guilt.
Those who are blessed with like fine looks also get screwed because it would be incredibly hard for them to step outside of the role that society has, you know, destined to them and to prove their worth regardless of appearance.
This failure in in perception is already deeply rooted, both with men and women, but there are extensive attempts to try and change people's perceptions and to educate children from a young age to start thinking differently.
These attempts are being aggressively curtailed by things such as beauty contests.
The damage clearly outweighs the benefits.
Please propose."
"We should disband amnesty international.
Amnesty international while incredibly well meaning, generally does massive harm in the areas it attempts to operate.
Because it is a blunt instrument, because it rarely respects nuance, it ought not continue its operations.
With that in mind, we propose the following model: that amnesty international should immediately disband and all money that currently hold should go to other charities which at deems as reasonable and efficient.
Three arguments for why this is a good idea: first on corruption.
Inevitably when NGO's operate in corrupt states they empower corrupt regimes why is this the case?
First, amnesty international regularly engages with an active dialogue with these states.
In doing so it inherently legitimizes their actions and respects them as a sovereign respectable power.
A lot of these states are states where coups have occurred, where unjust elections have occurred and as such, as amnesty actually engages with these individuals as just and legitimate political actors, it simply empowers them within the international sphere to make proclamations, declarations, and states that other actions it's takes are generally just.
Additionally, even when it doesn't give this sort of respect to the states when it goes into the state, when it continues to patronize businesses that operate within the state and when it pays the bribes to get resources into the state and people out of the state, that money always goes to corrupt regimes.
This means that if it operates in a fascist area with the the money could easily be used to further repress rights.
We believe that charitable organizations should ultimately be for the good of all people.
The ends can never justify the means.
The reason that this is true with a charity for a couple reasons: first, because charities are made up of a group of individuals not always with the same world view.
This means that I might be part of a vegan organization but I also think that human rights are important.
So I would never say that we should imprison meat eaters outright because I believe that there is some sort of right to self governments organization.
We would say that unless someone can articulate in an objective sense why their cause is the objectively best cause, you must be concerned with creating overall justness, overall good, rather than simply fighting for one good and and causing a variety of harms along the way.
Furthermore, if amnesty international empowers corruption within the states it is far more likely that further harms will occur where it can then imprison other people by expanding its surveillance state and being unjust.
A lot of amnesty international's cases are when it operates in an area or someone has been prisoned for political speech and if the surveillance state expands, that becomes considerably easier.
Now my second argument is about how complicates conflict.
The best way in which these sort of conflicts can be negotiated is when they're between two powers that are seen as somewhat legitimate and with some amount of leverage against one another.
Amnesty international does not hold that kind of leverage.
It simply names and shames these organizations as such, it is likely to exacerbate the problem rather than solve it.
Once amnesty international has entered the stage and said you must release this prisoner a government is given two options: release the prisoner and be seen as a weak government willing to bend to foreign powers, or continue the course, considerably more likely, given that these governments are typically run by strong men, strong women, who do not want to be seen as weak on crime or a slave of foreign governments.
As such, amnesty international can operate in the area and only make the problem worse by creating it so there's no incentive for the government to actually release a prisoner.
My third argument is about capital punishment.
Capital punishment isn't always bad.
It is largely based on societal norms and when heinous crimes have occurred, sometimes capital punishment is the only way to guarantee they do not continue to occur.
It is a true deterrent against all action and guarantees that the state has some power in the long term.
While western states might always have a better action, fledgling states, state that recently undergone revolution, can use capital punishment to incredible ends.
As such, amnesty international's outright stance against capital punishment is not beneficial to world justice.
For this reason, we should disband amnesty international."
"Use of the AI should be abandoned.
And I hope that the computer debater won't be offended here.
It's nothing personal.
I promise.
That said, we see two main reasons why the use of AI should be abandoned.
The first is that we think that the long term risks are generally going to outweigh the short term benefits, and the second is about the trade off in research and development funds.
So to focus on the long term risks and the short term benefits of artificial intelligence.
It's certainly true that increasing use of artificial intelligence in manufacturing and other industries has increased global economic products.
It would be very difficult to produce the amount of automobiles we do right now for instance without automated factories.
However these benefits largely accrue in the short term and we think that ultimately a few harms are going to outweigh them: the first is the massive destruction of the economy.
We've already seen many people laid off because automation has taken away their jobs.
But this is fundamentally different than other technologies.
No one would advocate for getting rid of cars just to keep horses employed, but we think that it's quite likely that in the future people will be largely unnecessary for most industries if AI keeps improving at a quick rate.
For instance, we think that AI is very soon going to completely replace trucking, manufacturing jobs, and some of the other most common professions in the united states, and leave tens of millions of people unemployed.
Right now the american welfare system does not have a way to cope with tens of millions of people suddenly becoming unemployed.
Now, an optimist would say that other jobs will come along to let these people do work.
But we think it's likely that soon AI will be so good that it can design new AI to do its job even better and replace even more human workers.
And what's more, that because payroll tends to be the most expensive part of running a business, that corporations will do everything they can to lay off as many people as possible and not offer them new jobs.
So we think that this is going to be fundamentally different than previous technologies that temporarily destructed the labor market, and that this could very well prevent humans from participating in the labor market at all in the long to medium term.
We could be the first generation that sees unemployment in western countries rise over fifty percent, and it will be because of automation.
But moreover, not to sound like a conspiracy theorist, that no one knows just how powerful AI is going to get.
What happens when people outsource major policy decisions to AI, because it's seen as neutral?
Which is something they're already discussing in the US as a solution to gerrymandering.
To have an artificial intelligence design our voting districts.
We think that ultimately an AI could make decisions that aren't the best for people and everyone will go along with them because they're seen as neutral or because a few people in power want to go along with it.
So we think that there's a risk to great dependence on AI undermining our society in many ways.
And our second argument is that this is a poor use of r and d funds.
To be frank it just seems to me that research and development should be focused on alleviating the most serious harms and artificial intelligence doesn't really play into that.
Right now there are eight hundred million people in food insecurity around the globe and hundreds of millions who lack access to clean water.
Coming up with more effective ways to distribute food and more effective ways to ensure that people have access to the resources that they need seems like a much better use of r and d funds than making a ford slightly cheaper and more efficient to produce.
And what's more, we also think that this trades off with medical funding which could save people's lives.
Now some might say that artificial intelligence will increase economic growth and that a rising tide lifts all boats, but as long as millions of people are dying from easily preventable diseases like diabetes, that don't have a cure yet, we think that that money would always be better spent on something like a cure for diabetes than it is on these machines.
For all these reasons, the use of AI should be abandoned.
Thank you."
"We should limit the right to asylum.
In this debate we don't think that we necessarily need to adopt incredibly stringent checks, we don't think we need to set exactly what those limits are going to be, but we're going to provide a model of what those limits would likely look like and we'll give a principle justification for why limits are something that are necessary in regards to the right to asylum.
So, a model.
We think that simple things like background checks on the people coming from dangerous areas and caps on the number of asylum seekers granted asylum are necessary in order to allow a states to function.
Rules don't need to be arcane but you need some sort of rules to promote the national interest.
So that's what we're going to talk about in this debate: why the government exists, first and foremost, to serve the people within its borders, and why that means that asylum must be limited.
So why did the state have an overriding obligation to citizens of that state?
Because people within the state pay taxes, serve in the military, are subject to the laws of the state and give up freedoms in being subject to those laws, these are all massively coercive aspects of a state.
It coerces people into behave in ways that they otherwise may not want to and coerces them into making sacrifices in their individual lives for the betterment of the state in general.
In doing so they earn certain privileges of citizenship that are meant to balance out the coercive power of the state and make that state just.
In essence the state must give preferential treatment to its citizens in order for it to be just, in order for it to justify the course of power of taxation, for servitude in the military, etcetera.
Asylum seekers are granted most of those privileges without the burdens that come with them.
Furthermore, they often come with the fewest resources available to them because they're fleeing some sort of situation that was dangerous in their previous country, one in which they may have had their assets seized, in which they may not have had many assets to begin with, and this means they are largely dependent on the state that they're fleeing to, which means that they are necessarily taking resources that other people needed to sacrifice for in order to earn.
These are resources that have been earned by members of the state and there is a necessary trade off between individual asylum seekers and individual citizens within a state because these resources are fungible.
Things like access to food stamps, things like access to public resources, and public funds are all fungible resources that cannot be shared between two people.
We do not think that we should damn people to the fate of an evil government.
We don't think that you need to necessarily restrict asylum in all cases because we think that there are obligations that people have to all other people to try and uphold and protect their human rights.
In fact that's how rights become so important.
That's how they gain power is by making an obligation on all people to uphold those those rights.
But there is an overriding obligation that the government has when it comes to their citizens.
An obligation that outweighs taking in all refugees and and fulfilling the rights of all people in all instances.
Because if you were to if you were to adopt that standard the state would obviously collapse.
And therefore we think that there are certain reasonable restrictions that you can place on asylum seekers.
Things that otherwise would cause the members of your citizenry to seriously suffer at the expense of other individuals which makes the coercive power of the state no longer justified.
This can come in the form of bringing in dangerous people that can harm the citizens of your state or in the form of draining collective resources to the point where you cannot pay those resources out to citizens that are in need of them.
Because of this you need reasonable limits on asylum.
Otherwise you harm those citizens who have an who you have an overriding obligation to beyond those basic obligations that you have to uphold all human rights.
For these reasons we should limit the right of asylum."
"ADHD management brings more good than harm because at the end of the day it leads to the recognition of a real issue that people have, and it fosters a sense of need and creates solutions to these problems, and at the end of the day there's no real harm that's associated with attempts for ADHD management.
So even if the good isn't all that present, since there's very minimal harm, it's something that you should just keep doing.
So, let's start by talking about ADHD and why I think that it's a real issue, that it's important for us to talk about.
Because it's not just some coincidence or some kind of like aberration that we've seen millions of millions of people in america being diagnosed with ADHD, and I think that there is to a large extent some biological reasons that have been like documented and are reasons why people have ADHD.
But it additionally can be the result of the way in which people in a new generation grow up.
When you grow up with a lot of technology and things like that, a lot of different entertainment options, and just in like day to day lives based on the way a lot of young people grow up nowadays, there's much more of an emphasis on ability to multitask, much more of an emphasis on keeping your attention divided on various things in a technologically advanced world.
So, I think that what this ultimately does is it does mean that it's for a lot of people legitimately more difficult to focus, that they just truly struggle on focus and that while they may be much better off focusing on multiple things at once, their skills aren't on more precise focus, on an individual task for a longer amount of time.
So this is a very real problem that we need to combat because this ultimately does hurt people for like tests, college and education, but also for jobs and inability to focus on things.
These are real problems that people have when they're not able to focus.
So it's definitely something that you want to fix.
And luckily we do have solutions that are like at least somewhat effective and using them oftentimes.
First of all, you can have medications.
These medications, oftentimes you don't even need to give someone with ADHD more than a small dosage of something like adderall a ritalin in order to actually start to see some of the effects of it.
In order to start to see people able to get more focused.
And at such small doses, even though they have a good affect on people, this isn't really going to bring a whole lot of possibility for harm or dependence or any of these other kinds of problems.
But even on the more extreme ends, these are ultimately rather like low risk drugs as long as you use them in the way that a doctor prescribes which is the same risk as any other drug.
And I think that it's therefore not all that bad that people are taking these drugs, that there's no real significant harms associated with them but the benefits are documented quite well.
Additionally I also think that behavioral changes and trying to make some more like lifestyle lifestyle changes as a part of ADHD management can also just be more positive.
If you're trying to like help you structure a lifestyle better in a way that's more conducive to focus, I don't see how you can say this actually is bringing harm to someone's life.
You're trying to help people individually, help their lives so they're better able to focus better in a more structured setting.
These are just clearly good things.
I don't know why you would say that they bring harm.
And that's the final thing I want to talk about.
About that I don't really think that any of these procedures have real harm.
I think that where the real harm lies is in not recognizing ADHD as an actual disease, as an actual impairment it's something that we need to do something to combat, and I think that management certainly brings a lot of good and that there's no real cost a lot of these things except willingness to embrace the management or the techniques themselves, which I think are ultimately going to make people's lives better.
So for all those reasons very proud to propose."
"Socialism brings more harm than good.
So, I just want to be very clear before we get into this debate.
By socialism, we mean the international workers movement, which has attempted to raise quality of life through union activism, through revolution against capitalist states, basically the movement that was so prominent in the late nineteenth through the twentieth centuries.
So with that in mind, this is an on balance debate.
What do I mean by that?
Obviously socialism has done a lot of really good things.
It's done a lot of really terrible things.
We think that in this debate, no one side has to prove that it's absolutely good or bad, just that the good outweighs the bad, or in our case that the harm outweighs the good.
And I think that also in this debate, it's important that we focus on the nations that are the worst off.
Why is this true?
Socialism might do some good for people in sweden, but ultimately we tell you, everyone in very developed countries is already better off than essentially everyone living in undeveloped countries.
The average person in india is much worse off than even the very poorest american, for instance, because they don't have access to things like clean, safe drinking water and electricity, that are taken for granted in this country.
So with that in mind, we have three big arguments.
The first is that revolutions that destabilize countries ultimately always do more harm than good.
Why is this true?
Let's take the best case for socialists.
Let's look at russia in nineteen seventeen.
You had this evil king who had put the country through a lot of war and conflict, who had starved people, who had prevented development that would have made the country better off, who was suppressing the rural people.
Even in that instance, when you had the perfect environment for a so-called just revolution, we see that the revolution ultimately harmed many more people than world war one or the czar himself actually did.
In the revolution, you had russian soldiers killing ukrainians, you had rebels looting farms, you ultimately had a conflict of the russian civil war that led into a tremendous famine that killed many more people than world war one did in russia.
So in in the end of the day, we think that revolutions, because they destabilize the production of food and goods and services, ruin peoples' lives and that these conflicts are never worth the ends that they claim that they will achieve.
So for that reason, we think that socialism brings more harm than good because it promotes these revolutions as a way to overthrow capitalism.
Our second argument is that socialism slows development.
The example that I want to talk about here is china.
So china was ruled by socialists from about nineteen forty nine when mao zedong won the civil war up until the early seventies when the gang of four was ousted after mao's death.
So at that time, we saw that china moved away from socialism and towards this kind of state-controlled capitalism.
What happened?
China went from a country with an average income of about twelve hundred dollars a year in today's money to a country with an average income of seven or eight thousand dollars a year in today's money.
This may not sound like a huge jump, but for the people living in china, it made an enormous difference.
They have much greater access to things like healthcare, they have more freedom about where they live and work, and ultimately people have a lot more personal freedom to make decisions about bettering their own life.
And that's possible because with capitalism, you can bring in foreign investment in order to grow more quickly.
A country often doesn't have enough capital to invest in itself in order to develop very quickly.
You need to bring in money from countries like the US or britain in order to develop, and we do that much better with capitalism than socialism.
So we think that slowing development ruins lives and therefore socialism brings more harm than good.
The last argument I'd like to make is one that's focused very much on the present, which is that socialism isolates countries.
The countries that still practice socialism, like cuba, have been isolated from the rest of the world because the other other countries are afraid basically of socialism spreading, they see them as a pariah.
What this means?
That you have more difficulty trading, you have a harder time importing goods, and since these countries are not very rich and powerful, this cuts off their access to important things like medical supplies and equipment that would make your people's lives much better.
So we think that ultimately, socialism brings more harm than good because it inspires revolutions, it slows development, and it isolates countries.
Thank you."
"We should ban breast implants.
That being said, we're not saying that like individuals who maybe had cancer and want to return to the breast size, we think that those kind of implants would be fine.
We also think that like if like if you were a victim of some sort, like if these are medically necessary for any reason, than we're fine.
We're specifically talking about like aesthetic kind of implants.
So three main areas of clash, first on reaffirming the patriarchy.
Recognize that the patriarchy exists as a underlying structure within our society by which men are able to maintain power over women, over their sexuality, over their expression and the way in which it leaks into the workforce, like evaluations of skill.
The concept of larger larger breasts being so attractive that they are worth going under the knife for, worth altering your own body, is entirely a patriarchal concept.
Women don't care what size their breasts are insofar as any size is capable for their needs.
It will breast feed, it will exist, it will get in their way when they're trying to do chores or run.
It is a man's desire pushed onto a woman's body that they need to have large breasts.
It's based entirely on what men are likely to find attractive, it prioritize male male pleasure and perception above personal comfort and personal fiscal security.
It further portrays women as objects rather than agents, with men as there arbiters.
So there's a difference between me being like: "" yes, I want big breasts because this is a personal desire of mine, because it will help me self actualize. ""
Verses me saying: "" I want big breasts because a man will like me more. ""
We think the difference occurs within the ways in which people internalize the impacts of their actions.
Whether that impact is on me or that impact is on somebody else.
And we think what happens on their side of the house is that you're continually reaffirming the patriarchy and that it continues the idea that women are objects and men are prioritized above their own safety.
Our second area of clash is about how it's bad for women.
Recognize that it reaffirms the idea that your own pleasure is less important than a man's and that your body is an object for others' pleasure and use.
This is an awful way to feel about your body because there are an infinite amount of things that society can find wrong with it.
But the only way in which you get around not having to alter every single portion of you, not having to be perfectly skinny at all times, not having the right eye color or hair length or hair color, is that you start to accept yourself for who you are.
And we think that they make that world a lot further away on their side of the house when they say: "" no like we're fine with continuing to propagate breast implants as like a metric of beauty or a metric of sexual attractiveness "".
Recognize that as more women participate in this it becomes infinitely more glamorized.
It creates an expectation in society that this is how women ought look, it makes young girls be like like have access to this early on, so they feel like they have to have this and like be like this, and we think that continuing this cycle is really dangerous, because women that see this and think that's the only way they can link into attractiveness.
And we think that's very bad both in like a personal self esteem level, like we don't think that any young girl should have the expectation of big breasts before she's even old enough to like, I don't know, take a test.
Moreover, we just think that this becomes a norm in society that is inherently unachievable.
Like it's not the case that the majority of women can look that way, or even ought to look that way.
Which brings us to our third area of clash, which is about why it's bad for society.
Because what happens on their side of the house is that you propagate an expectation.
And this is bad because recognize that there is like a cost barrier here.
Like implants cost money.
And it reestablishes the idea that sexuality and being attractive comes with a price tag.
We just also think that all of the above things can't be like propagated within society.
Like we prefer a world in which young girls are able to love themselves and even older women don't feel unattractive because of their breasts.
Proud to propose."
"We should ban the spanking of children.
Basically what we are defending in this debate is a categorical ban on striking your children.
This kind of policy already exists in some countries like germany, whereas in other countries like the UK and the US the use of force is limited but not prohibited.
Three arguments for you today: the first, and I think the least important, but one that's worth getting out there, is that spanking doesn't work.
Children don't change their behavior.
They just learn to lie about it and conceal poor behavior from their parents.
The reason that this is true is that in order to change someone's behavior you need them to internalize why their behavior is wrong.
If you hit someone for something and they don't understand why, as is often going to be the case with these children, we tell you that ultimately they won't change their behavior in any meaningful way, they'll just learn to conceal it from you in order to avoid being spanked.
At that point we tell you that this is poor parenting and that it ought to be banned in order to prevent people who are uneducated from relying upon it as a parenting technique.
So our first main argument is that this is a form of child abuse.
You wouldn't let someone hit a child in any other circumstances, so why should it be okay if it's connected to a bad grade school or cheating in a soccer match?
We think that ultimately it's important that the law is consistent.
Right now there's a huge amount of gray area between what is child abuse and what isn't.
In districts like where I live in boston, where this is legal, we tell you that parents can playoff legitimate abuse as discipline and that ultimately people who are mandatory reporters, such as teachers, might be willing to overlook clear signs of abuse because they chalk it up to discipline rather than what it really is.
So ultimately we think that because this is indistinguishable from abuse in terms of its practical outcomes, namely injured children, and because it discourages people from reporting and dealing with abuse, that we need to ban spanking and require people who are mandatory reporters to report signs of spanking as well as other abuse.
Our second argument is that this causes children to internalize harmful norms.
So realize the way that we treat people as children determines how they treat others as adults.
What message does that send when you teach children that because parents are bigger than them, they get to hit them when they do something they don't like?
We think that it's no surprise that people who grow up in abusive households are much more likely to go on to be abusive themselves.
Ultimately it seems very likely that children who were spanked are likely to use violence as a problem solving method later on.
We think that this doesn't imply that those people lack moral character, but this is probably something that they internalize and never think critically about because the experienced it at such a young age.
We think that the state needs to intervene here because there is a clear third party harm to spanking.
Right?
It's not just an interaction between parent and child.
We think that in that case maybe there's a world in which the state should stay out of it.
But we think that because this socializes children to have such a negative effect on others, that ultimately there is a clear state interest in preventing this behavior.
So what we've shown you today is that spanking is inefficient and it needs to be banned, because parents who lack information will continue to use it even though, you know, doctors and psychiatrists have been advising against it for decades.
We also think it should be banned because in its material effects it's indistinguishable from abuse and it makes it easier for parents to conceal abuse.
And lastly we've explained to you that it ought be banned because it causes children to internalize harmful norms, and that ultimately this makes them more of a threat to others and a danger to society compared to people who were not spanked.
So for these reasons we think it's clear that government intervention is justified and that we should ban spanking.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's round is that we should ban infant circumcision, we being governments in western liberal democracies.
I think the main takeaway before I get into my points of clash is that you can still make a decision to get circumcised when you are an adult, consenting male above or at the age of eighteen.
The problem that we're trying to deal with is the fact that children currently get forced into systems where, without their consent or knowledge, they are forced into circumcision, and they cannot change it for the rest of their lives.
Two main areas of clash, the first on bodily autonomy and the undermining of consent.
Because recognize that it is a generally accepted principle that people should be able to choose what to do with their own bodies insofar as they have to live with these bodies forever, and the decisions that other people make aren't necessarily going to be short-lived and I just go on with my life after I make it.
Even if you don't buy that though, people also get to make the decisions for their own bodies, because we recognize that people who like exist within those bodies tend to be the most informed and the most capable of acting on their own behalf.
Insofar as they have to live with the decisions that they make for the rest of their lives, insofar as these decisions personally affect them in a way that it doesn't affect anyone else, incentives exist for me to take my own safety, security and desires in a much more serious way than anyone else would.
As such, we tell you that people are the only ones who are capable of making decisions on their own behalf and when it is possible, we ought wait and let them do so.
The problem is that in the status quo, parents get to make decisions that can wait until that child is eighteen, but they make them so early that the child never gets a say in the first place, even though the procedure is permanent.
But we recognize already that parents don't have these kinds of infinite rights.
In western liberal democracies, parents aren't legally allowed to force children into marriage, people children under eighteen can't get tattoos, and parents can't put their babies under plastic surgery until those children are at least sixteen and enthusiastic about getting it done.
All we're saying is that our side of the house protects you from this permanence, first, in a legally consistent manner with what we currently allow in law, but also in a morally consistent manner.
More than this though, recognize that circumcision is basically just genital mutilation.
Insofar as it is just a child who is getting a part of their body removed without that child's consent, we think it is hypocritical and arbitrary that the difference is what religions use this kind of practice and where it gets used.
It doesn't make it more consensual.
If we look down on female genital mutilation, we ought also be looking down on circumcision.
So the other side might get up here and talk about religious rights, but recognize that those rights don't extend infinitely.
We don't allow the stoning of those who engage in premarital sex or the painful sacrifice of animals or female genital mutilation.
If we recognize that we don't allow other religious practices because of their impact on those who cannot consent and the harm that they have, this is incredibly similar.
Also, recognize that circumcision injuries are very common, especially when done by religious figures with little professional training.
What this means is before I'm evil even capable of using it for the first time, I might have a deformity that I never consented into, never signed a contract to sign my rights away to, but I can never sue for.
What we're saying is just that we must protect those who can't protect themselves.
But next, let's talk about the way that it traps people into religion.
Because we tell you that many people don't choose to follow their parents religions insofar as they grow up and find that they don't think it's consistent with their own belief systems, or they just develop their own belief systems.
We think it is unjust that these people get forced to wear a mark of that religion on their bodies forever, and we think that part of the choice that we talked about is also being able to choose the religion that you want and the way in which you want to represent that religion.
We think in the same way that jews can choose to wear yarmulkes in public or not, it probably ought be your decision whether or not you want to be circumcised or not, and whether that is part of how you follow that religion.
In the end, male circumcision is fine when an adult is making that decision for themselves.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"Single-sex schools should be banned because they're harmful for learning.
They hinder learning in a lot of ways, and they're a modern manifestation of separate but equal in a in a way that oftentimes reinforces bad gender roles, particularly when it comes to like single-sex religious schools and things like that.
So, let's start by talking about even in the most like positive picture of a single-sex school, they simply aren't going to do learning as effectively, and there is a lot of reasons why.
The first of which is that one of the most important things that you need to learn is how to communicate and interact with people of different genders.
And that's an incredibly important thing because, in the real world, you're going to interact and have to, whether it's in like your workplace, well mostly in your workplace, but also in like likely your personal life and other kinds of things that you're going to do, you're likely going to interact with people of different genders and therefore, you're gonna want to get experience with these people, because people have people who have different sexes have oftentimes different perspectives because they've had different experiences, different struggles in their lives, so it's important to make sure that you're learning from them in the sense that it's going to prepare you for your future because you're going to have a like a better ability to communicate and understand people, but it's also going to give you a broader perspective in understanding of the world.
Because you're going to learn from people for with different perspectives, whether it's in like a class discussion in a civics class about something and now you're going to be having different perspectives from different people, which can lead to maybe you changing your opinion on something.
These are all things that can only happen if you have learning in a setting in which people of different genders are represented.
So, that's very important.
But , beyond that, it's also just inherently important because the way in which like you interact with people is probably the most important thing that is going to that you actually take out of school.
A lot of the things that you learn in school, you're probably not going to remember forever.
Like, if I am going if I'm gonna go to law school for like my like career, I'm probably not going to need to know all that much from my AP biology class in high school.
I'm probably not going to need to remember too much of from my algebra class.
Those things are in a lot of ways just transient things that you learn at a certain point in your time because you have to, but they're not really things that you take away for the rest of your life.
They're not really things you actually need to know for actually like an enriching education.
But learning how to work with other people who you live with and like your society is definitely a skill that you need to make sure that you're more good at, and that's definitely more likely to happen when you have integrated education.
But, the next argument is that oftentimes I think that , especially when you're talking about what mostly when you're talking about all-male schools, it's a way of institutionalized elitism.
When you're talking about all-male boarding schools, a lot of times it's like a feeder into certain kinds of privileged jobs or privileged universities.
A lot of times all-male boarding schools can be ways in which like cycles of wealth and cycles of being well-off are reinforced in our society in pretty harmful ways.
But beyond that, I also think , especially when it comes to religious education, single-sex schools can be incredibly harmful in the way in which they play into traditional gender roles in society, which can be really bad.
So if you have like a religious school that has classes for who has basically divisions based on gender, it's likely going to have focusing on different values for women that they do for men, teaching them to be certain kinds of people, putting them in a box as for how long they should be learning, which I think is pretty bad for actually making sure that people are equal.
So for all of those reasons, we should ban single-sex schools."
"Internet censorship brings more good than harm, for two big reasons L first, because internet censorship will prevent the rise of fake news, which is absolutely catastrophic for society, currently, and second, because internet censorship can end cyber bullying, and the horrible consequences that that results in, so, let's start by talking about fake news.
I think that, fake news is an incredibly important issue in this debate, for a couple of reasons: first, because fake news is becoming widely prevalent, as far as problems are concerned.
Keep been mind that, there are millions upon millions of articles, or tens of thousands of articles, they got millions and millions of clicks and views, that are not factually verified in any way, that they can be posted by some random blog, then picked up by some random like news accumulator, and finds its way on twitter, and then suddenly you find, because of various algorithms on twitter and facebook, that result in sensationalizing content, being prioritized over accuracy of content.
The result that you get is that, you see a lot of fake news that's being widely disseminated, and widely read, and people interpret these things as facts, because there's no real mechanisms that check against these things.
And then secondarily, what this does, is it results in incredibly bad social harms, because it skews people's perceptions of reality.
It does this by either inventing problems that don't exist, so, you can look at something like immigration, like saying that immigrants are more likely to be rapists or murderers, even if the opposite is true, factually in reality, and oftentimes immigrants are law abiding citizens, and show more respect for the law than a lot of other people in society.
What it does is that, you are can look at a lot of like fake news as the way it actually skews reality, or on the flip side of that, it allows you to come up with just like false data, or ignore problems that actually do exist, so things like global warming, which are clearly a major threat to the entire world, these problems can get ignored, because you can just have someone put out a fake news article that discredits the actual science, and then people start to believe that.
And, I think that, the problem with this, that this lead to huge social impacts, this guides social policy, and I think that the goal of the state is to do what is in the best interests of the people, and while it's obviously we're always going to have, in a democratic society, a difference in values, a difference in preferences of what's important, all of these value oriented debate should be based off of reasonable sets of facts, and a reasonable reality.
Because, once you're operating from the same reality, the disagreements that you're going to have are going to be far more reasonable, and far less hostile, and you're at least going to agree that, what are the problems, and what are different ways that we can solve the problems.
But,when you have fake news rising, you're not really having constructive discourse at all.
You're not really going to be able to solve any problems at all, because the nature of the even existence of problems is, on its root, being disputed.
But, the second thing that I want to talk about is about cyber bullying, because since it's very easy for you to just make your attacks on other people anonymous, and ensure complete lack of accountability, it's very hard to punish people if they try to cyber bully somebody.
So, you necessarily need to have censorship as a way to block these kinds of harms, prevent these harms.
And I think that, the importance of cyberbullying and trolling isn't something that should be understated, because when you first and foremost, there's a general fear that comes to these things, oftentimes these things come in the form of threats, so, threats to threats to your family and your safety, and this could force people into hiding in some circumstances, because they fear of the internet, and all of their information getting publicly released on the internet, it's called getting, or this could also result in severe mental health issues, even suicide in more severe cases.
So that's a clear problem that we need to combat.
So for all those reasons, internet censorship brings more good than harm."
"International recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia are definitely justified.
So, the first thing that we should consider is: why do these people want independence anyway?
Why would anyone want independence?
Cause it's important to note that independence isn't just some easy thing that you ask for, or you push a like you like check a box on a ballot initiative and suddenly you get it.
Independence takes up a ton of political will, it can cost a whole lot of money, there can be huge transition costs associated with the establishment of the new government, there's also a whole lot of instability that's associated with getting independence.
It's not this easy thing to do.
So, given that independence is difficult and it does come with risk, the fact that people want independence so badly is pretty telling.
So, what do I think it's telling about this, and where do I think therefore are like the real reasons why this international recognition is justified?
First, the international recognition is justified because it allows these people to have their own destiny and their own way of choosing how to like spend their money, live their lives, and all of this, which I think is just a right that people should have, and second, I think that it ensurers a freedom from like oppression of the, of people.
Independence prevents as much of an ability for some kind of exterior imperialistic force or whatever to have exert their control over you and your resources, which I think is quite bad.
So, let's talk about like the concept of freedom of control over your own like policy priorities and things like that.
Because recognize that if you're not independent and especially if you are not independent and like your like cultural group is not the majority, then decisions about when to go to war, decisions about how much to spend on education or healthcare, who's going to get more money spent on education or healthcare or investing and things like that, who's going to like invest in like where infrastructure projects or government grants, whether these employment opportunities going to come forth.
All of these things are going to be first and foremost done in a way in which you're not actually going to have the power over these things.
So they're inherently less democratic.
You're not, if you were independent you'd just get to have control over all the spending priorities and things like that, so these are in line with your own values and your own preferences which are first and foremost like more likely to be accurate the more local they are, but secondarily can be like widely different values based on different cultures.
So you can't just assume because you live near someone that this is like a fair way of actually going near these kinds of things.
But in addition to this just being like more democratic and like more representative, this is also better in the way in which it's distributed because keep in mind that like if you have like power over a group and your the group in power, you're going to want to distribute your resources in a way that's going to be better suiting for you.
You're more likely going to see, if you live in a different, if like the like primary control is in one region, you are more likely to see like the investment focusing on that region and you're going to be less likely to therefore see like the fair consideration.
So I think that's bad.
But, additionally I also think that like it's important to note why people are so resistant to independence.
And they're resistant because they're just like greedy.
They're just resistant because they wanna take advantage of natural resources in these places.
They want to take advantage of like like keeping these people down economically so they can take advantage of that cheaper labor.
They want to take advantage of them so like they can like keep discriminating or things like that.
These are grossly illegitimate reasons why you wanna maintain, or like you wanna maintain like your own like international perception of superiority or like you wanna maintain an image of soft power around the world.
I'm sorry.
Those things are not more important than the actual livelihoods of these people, who are being oppressed, the livelihoods of people who aren't actually getting able to decide their own ways of living their lives, and do so democratically.
I think that this is just like the definition of oppression and these are things that the international community should not condone.
And the only reason they wouldn't do so is out of fear or selfishness.
That's not right.
So very proud to propose."
"We should ban corporal punishment.
In this round we're gonna make two main arguments about why we think all forms of corporal punishment should be banned in the home and why you should face criminal penalties and face losing your children if you ever use corporal punishment.
The first and main argument is that corporal punishment is simply abuse.
That in all other spheres of life, and even in this sphere in many instances, any sort of physical harm of another person that they haven't consented into, so in in out in ways outside of things like sport for example, in all other walks of life, assault is abuse and this type of abuse is punished in a criminal manner.
Children in these instances cannot defend themselves much like victims of assault in the higher legal system.
Children have no means of defending themselves against a harm that a that a parent figure is inflicting on them not only because they are much you know smaller in most cases than those parents but because their their caregiver, the person that controls their ability to live, their ability to be fed, to have a roof over their heads, the ability to get their basic sustenance, and the figure that they are supposed to trust in the world, as someone that's supposed to guide them and love them, that person attacking you, that person physically harming you in a way to say that you are lesser, that you've done something wrong, treating you like an animal more so that a person, treating you in a way that we wouldn't treat most pets, doing these types of things belittles you on a mental level in addition to a physical level.
It makes it even more difficult to lash back.
Even if you could protect yourselves, if you had you know if you were if you were large enough or old enough or physically capable enough to protect yourself, you're still mentally you're still mentally harmed by this action and it means that you're likely unable to actually defend yourself in a meaningful way and that mental harm scars that child in the long run and harms them emotionally in the long run.
So it's not just physical abuse by a parent but it's mental abuse, it's belittling, it's something that leaves deep scars on a child's psyche and has shown to pass that behavior on to future generations which we'll get to in a second.
All of this we think is satisfactory evidence to say that people that do these things to their child even if it's just smacking a child on the wrist in occasion, even if it's just doing light corporal punishment, it still carries that type of effect on the child and we see no reason why just because someone is a parent of someone else that assault shouldn't be punished in a meaningful way which means we must ban all forms of corporal punishment in the home.
But secondarily, corporal punishment as a mechanism for teaching good behavior in the long run has been shown to be ineffective.
Studies have come out about child psychology in child development that show rewarding good acts, actually giving a child some sort of reward or telling them that they had done well making them feel good when they do things that are worthy of praise, even small things teaches behavior in a much more effective way than harming of child, than doing something negative to them in the long run and while you know punishing someone, corporal punishment be effective in stopping someone for a short period of time, it doesn't teach the actual behavior that then allows them to go on and be a stable member of society.
In fact it teaches them resentment.
It makes them more angry and it makes them more likely to lash out.
When they feel like the parental figure in their life doesn't care for them, when they feel like the parental figure in the life is out to get them they're more likely to lash out especially when you go to being a teenager, when you already have many emotional and physical developments that are occurring that make you more likely to lash out anyway and be resentful and finally, this does pass this behavior on to future generations.
If you received corporal punishment as a child you are more likely to view it to view it as something that's acceptable to do to your children and if you hadn't then you're more likely to view it as something that isn't acceptable.
It passes that abuse on down the line and doesn't just hurt people in that status quo but hurts future generations.
For these reasons, we should ban corporal punishment in the home."
"We should support water privatization.
Water privatization is a major hot-button issue in our modern day.
Many individuals around the united states are afraid of what water privatization might do for their own access to water.
We live in one of the wealthiest states on earth.
The vast majority of people in our planet understand that access to water is not very hard to get and will not be hard to get even if we privatize water due to the fact that both government regulation exists and we have a huge amount of water and because we have a massive amount of money that can be used to subsidize access to water.
With that mind, I would propose the following model: that the government look to auction off more bodies of water to sell it to private organizations so they can manage it and distribute it.
Three arguments for why this is a good idea.
First, we think that will maximize access.
In the united states in places like flint michigan and parts of detroit in parts of many states around the world we see lead in pipes.
We see access to water decreased because the government is unwilling or unable to act.
A few reasons why we think that in these areas private corporations will be far more effective.
First, private corporations do not have sovereign immunity.
It's impossible to sue the government of flint michigan for failing to provide water and especially if you want any return because one, they don't really have any money to fix anything but two, they have government immunity which means that there's no actual way to get them to change.
They are immune from the courts.
They are the very power which would lay down the judgment and as such, they cannot command themselves in the way that they do not want to act.
As such, we think that private corporations can be sued.
They can be forced to take action and fix many water supplies around the the united states secondly, resources.
We think that many state governments have their hand in too many pots trying to manage waste services, trying to manage roads and construction is incredibly difficult.
If the united states had the government running every single construction site we'd have no money for anything else, we'd be overrun with other issues.
In the same way, when we try to run every single water plant in the united states, we think that we simply don't have the resources to do that and everything else.
With private corporations they'll have far more resources at their disposal to fix lead pipes, to fix damaged areas, and as such, will be able to fix them far more easily.
Third and finally, private corporations have the biggest incentive to change it.
We think that the capacity to sell water to certain groups of people makes private companies pretty happy.
We don't think the government actually really cares whether or not certain people have access to water besides an abstract ethical obligation but honestly, politicians don't really have strong codes of ethics in many cases.
Private corporations also don't have strong codes of ethics but they have an incentive to always be pumping water to people so they can sell it to them as such, we think the total access to water will increase substantially as a result of water privatization.
My second argument is about cleanliness.
We think that governments don't do a good job keeping reservoirs clean, keeping rivers clean, and as a result many people get sick.
Many times we don't see the proper chemical such as fluoride put in waters for certain cities.
Private corporations will have a greater incentive to keep this cleanliness as if they don't we can see that the government will give their contract to someone else who will keep it clean.
Third and finally, innovation.
We think that there's much innovation that can be done regarding water.
New chemicals can be put in to guarantee it's clean for longer.
We can change the way in which we have our pipes, change our methods of distribution to be considerably more efficient.
We think that massive amounts of water are leaked out in the status quo.
This waste water can be put to good use by these corporations as they have far more incentive to innovate than the government.
For this reason, we should support water privatization."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should ban genetically modified crops.
We'll model this as just you know ban on sale in the way we would normally ban sale of any product so probably jail time for the people that produce the product, we'll also model it is you know financial penalties for people that are found in possession of the product unless of course they weren't aware that it was genetically modified.
Our first independent point is that largely these products are you know marketed as the result of an information asymmetry.
That people aren't quite aware of you know what goes into these products and what specifically has been genetically modified and at that point there isn't meaningful consent into the purchase of this product.
Well we think that obviously there are large amounts of food that this applies to.
We think this is particularly pernicious with genetically modified crops because people don't really understand the science that goes into the development of these products and as such that there isn't really a meaningful way that they could properly understand the product itself.
There really isn't any amount of government labeling that can just like explain to people like complex biological ideas and like research methods and at that point there isn't a way to obtain meaningful consent.
So given thought then, we think that the ban is justified.
Our second independent point is that there are unintended consequences that are intrinsic to scientific you know scientific advancements such as this, but particularly with food we think that there is a higher standard that has to be applied really for two reasons.
The first is that most of the side effects can't be measured for a very long time.
Things that have a detrimental effect on your diet take you know decades to actually reveal like meaningful measurable effects which is why you know even just now we're you know getting new research about things that we've obviously had access to the data on for a long amount of time, things like you know red meat being carcinogenic.
It's not like red meat is new, it's just that it takes a long time for us to collect this data because of one, advancements in you know measuring technology but two, because you know you actually have to have a lot of time with the food being a steady part of an individual's diet to have that measurable effect.
The problem then with genetically modified crops is that you know you have to expose someone to this thing for decades before you can really find out if it has harmful effects.
That in turn means that you are almost guaranteed to wind up putting something on the market that has an extremely detrimental effect because you just didn't know until like thirty years later that it was so harmful.
Given that, we think a ban is justified because the large amounts of effects that can be you know intrinsic to food this is something that's consumed by large amounts of people and as such has a really systemic effect on the population, are you know grave enough to warrant a ban.
Our third independent point is damage to ecosystems.
So particularly with regards to animals we think that there's some pretty profound effects that can happen with genetically modified crops that aren't you know within the financial incentives of the firms that develop them.
I do think that broadly speaking a company like monsanto, doesn't like like intentionally poison people for if no reason other than monsanto needs people to be alive to continue selling them products but those same incentive structures don't apply to animals.
I think broadly speaking if we take a plain pleasure analytic perspective and decide through that that animals have rights it's important to you know actually create products that aren't going to be harmful if like a dear decides to wander onto a farm and nibble on some of the corn that's growing there.
Likewise, I think there's just brought ecosystem related reasons why even humans benefit from just having like a stable environment and not like jeopardizing the like like local wildlife.
At that point then, we think that for the same reasons that apply to humans but even more broadly because there's less incentive to test them properly, animals are put extremely at risk by the proliferation of genetically modified crops.
Proud to propose."
"We should disband the united nations.
In its conception, the united nations had the goal of bringing together the world, and the for an opportunity for peace between neighboring countries, and a global idea and a global order.
But we think that the united nations has fallen far from this ideal level, and we think that for the vast majority of actions taken by the united nations, these are actions that are simply proxies for imperialism, and proxies for strong nations to take decisions into their own hands about how small nations are going to behave.
We think that the united nations could better exist, the goals of the united nations could better exist if one were to do things like set up better treaty organizations and set a better international relations between countries directly, rather than have this sort of quasi global governing authority, that is for the most part ineffective, but when it is effective we think is very problematic.
So those are the two things that we're gonna talk about.
First we're going to talk about why the united nations, for the most part, is ineffective and why it's a massive money waste, and secondly, we're going to talk about the instances in which it is effective and why those are the worst instances.
Okay.
So why is the united nations ineffective?
We don't think it is nearly it is capable of acting in unison, and what this means is that there are so many varied interests that take part in the decision making at the united nations, that we don't think that it's able to intervene in instances when it's supposed to, when when it was created to exist.
Take for example the genocide in rwanda, a genocide in which people knew was going to happen, they saw the tensions rising, they saw the potential of violence and the outbreak of violence, but the united nations didn't wasn't able to step in until after most of the violence had already occurred, and when it did step in it wasn't able to stop the violence, it was only able to set up certain sanctuary cities.
We think that this is massively ineffective, given the amount of money that is put into this, for example.
And other instances in which the united nations have simply been ineffective, isn't doing things like solving the dispute in the palestinian conflict, and in trying to keep order and say the south the southeast agency.
We think that these are instances in which the united nations exists to serve those purposes.
We think it exists to serve as a mediator in these conflicts, in these genocides, in these tensions, and it simply has shown time and again to be ineffective in doing so.
But the united nations takes in billions of dollars every year from a from a vast array of countries, that we think otherwise could be better used domestically in those states to help the people in those in those states themselves, or would be better used if all the money, say, went to unicef as like one sole body that the united nations would remain, if we disbanded the united nations aside from this one piece that only serves as a charitable arm.
So, we think that for the most part it's ineffective in these measures.
But when it is effective, it's almost always for imperialist means.
For example, the security council is controlled almost entirely by large nations, specifically by the US and its allies, russia and china.
What this means is that when the united nations chooses to use military force, it does take some sort of military action against a country, it is almost always directed by the interests of those three major power blocs.
And what this means is that the only time when there's any sort of intervention in human rights violations, or in any sort of country's sovereignty, is when those three states agree that it should be done, or when it serves those political interests.
We think that this is a fundamentally broken model for how we're going to use the the united nations security forces, and how it's going to direct force throughout the world.
We think that this is only a another tool for imperialist powers to use in a way that it has been able to do for the last century, the last two centuries.
We don't think that it should continue, we don't think the united nations should be this beacon for imperialism as it currently is, and for these reasons we should disband the united nations."
"Progressive tax is beneficial.
When we're talking about a progressive tax what we mean is a taxation system from a federal government or some other government in which individuals are taxed at a certain rate based on their income or based on some other quantifier that goes up, given the amount of wealth or influence or whatever measure you're going to go by, that's the tax we're talking about when we're talking about progressive taxation we're specifically talking about a type of income tax in which higher income tax, or higher income individuals are taxed at a higher rate.
So we think there are two reasons that progressive taxation is a beneficial form of taxation, and is better than a flat tax, which is another standard form of taxation.
The first is that progressive taxes more fair, and the second is that a progressive tax allows for more revenue with which the government can do more for the public good.
So firstly, why is a progressive tax fair?
We think that the basis for taxation is that when individuals enter into a society, they give up certain rights in order to gain access to certain common and public goods.
We think that when society gives out these goods, these are given based on the fact that individuals are taxed and they give up certain amounts of money, and they give up certain amounts of the product of their labor in order to gain those public goods, and in essence they're paying for those goods.
We think that individuals that are of higher incomes have gained more from those public goods than other members of society.
Now, what does this mean?
Recognize that these public goods includes things like the infrastructure with which commerce can occur, the protection with which commerce can occur, and all the other aspects of a functioning market that allow for individuals to participate in the capitalist system and make money from what they have been make money from their labor.
We think that this means that individuals that are able to gain more from this market essentially gained more from the existence of that market, and gain more from the system itself, but all individuals are need to pay into the system that allows for this market to occur.
Given that individuals are paying into this market, we think that the individuals that gain the most from that market are also bear the burden of ensuring that the market exists, especially given that that market often excludes a vast majority of the population, for instance, income inequalities rampant across western states in the status quo, and this means that this capitalist system has left many people out, and we don't think that those people should be forced to bear the burden of what the what these taxes ultimately go for, which the infrastructure that allows these things to function.
Now, this doesn't mean that individuals who are of lower class shouldn't pay into this pay into public works, because we think they also gain things outside of the economic boom that comes from the infrastructure that exists, but we think that they should be proportionate to what the individual has been gaining from that.
So secondly, why do we think that a progressive tax is going to get you more revenue?
We think that a flat tax rate means that individuals need to be taxed at a rate at which they can bear the burden of their taxation, which means you ultimately need to defer to the lowest tax bracket to determine how much of a tax rate they can bear in being able to live their lives but still pay the taxes that they get.
We think that for higher classes this is definitionally a higher burden that they can bear, because they have more disposable disposable income with which they can pay their taxes.
This means that if you have a progressive tax system, you can set appropriate rates for the burden that individuals can bear when taxing and when drawing from individuals' income, which means you can gain, on net, more money from a society and more money which you can do the public works.
This means that you can do more good for the whole, which means that you can get more infrastructure, both for the lower and higher classes, but it also means that when these individuals pay more into the system it keeps the capitalist system going, which allows them to gain that money back in the long run, and because it's more fair and you can get more revenue for the public good, we think that you should prefer a progressive tax."
"Private universities should be banned.
We think the way that we're going to do this and to set up a model for this debate is that we're going to phase out private universities over the period of say ten years, and in this ten year period people will still be able to attend those universities but those universities won't be won't be allowed to accept new admissions and after that ten year period is over these universities will have to close their doors.
And at that point anyone that's still in that university will likely have to transfer, but hopefully after ten years people won't be won't still need to complete their degrees.
Okay, so we would say, and the broad argument that we want to make in this round is that college as a concept is incredibly problematic, and that private universities make that problematic concept in practice much worse.
What we mean by this is that there is massive social pressure to go to college.
Kids in high school and in middle school, and honestly throughout their whole lives, are told that their future depends on going to college.
And more so, they're told that they need to go to a name brand school if they're going to really succeed.
If they want to be successful in life they need to go to the most prestigious universities, these universities that happen to be private universities.
We think that private schools buy into this narrative in their marketing and in the way that they try to sell themselves to students, and they do it at an immense profit for themselves.
Private schools are way more way more costly than public education for a very similar quality of education that's being provided.
And it's also just not the case that everyone needs to go to college.
This is a myth that has been perpetuated, but there are good jobs that are available to people that choose not to go to college.
But this myth pressures people into going.
There's a fear of people that are exiting high school, that they can't get a good job without some sort of education.
And private schools increase their prices each year regardless of this fact.
We think that private schools hold immense amounts of leverage because of their social cachet and they can't be checked by the public in the same way that public schools can be.
We think that public schools have a budget that can be reined in by taxpayers and by politicians to ensure that you don't have to meet, you don't need to continually increase the cost of admission, and it can also ensure high standards for education.
More so, public education can draw on public funds.
Which means that in the event that you actually do need to raise the costs of running the university, you don't need to put the full weight of that cost on to people that are attending school, you can distribute it amongst the public.
This is especially crucial, because the people that are attending the schools are the people that are least capable of paying for that education.
We also think there's just more money for public schools if no one is going to a private school.
There will be an immense shift from private to public universities, and what that it will increase the collective resources at everyone's disposal.
This eliminates the pressure for people to mortgage their future in order to go to an expensive private school.
This idea is also just not a free choice because of that social stigma.
Because kids that are making the decision to go to a private school are not old enough to internalize what that debt burden will mean to them in in the future.
If you're a senior about to enter college, you don't know that taking on twenty thousand dollars a year in loans will ensure that you end up paying off those loans for a decade after you leave college.
It may eventually ruin your credit, it may eventually ruin your life, and you could have gone to a much cheaper public school instead.
We also think that people, even if they could internalize that value, could internalize that risk, still aren't able to make a free decision because of the social pressures of parents, classmates, employers and the media.
Banning private universities ensures that people make more reasonable fiscal decisions and it ensures that people aren't plagued by that social stigma of needing to go to an elite school when they simply cannot afford it.
For these reasons private universities should be banned."
"Tattoos should be banned.
So quickly a model for this motion.
We think that this would be banned at the state level or any sort of federal level by the government and that the punishment for violating this ban would probably be something in terms of a lite fine or lite community service.
We don't think that this needs to be punished to a dramatic degree and it would be proportional a proportional punishment would be something like a fine.
Okay so regardless of enforcement, why do we think tattoos should be banned?
Firstly, because you are a future you're the future person you will become is distinct from your current person.
So let's walk through this.
We think that the unified experience of identity in consciousness is simply an illusion.
The person that you're composed of the person that you are is composed of a few things your preferences, your mores and your beliefs at any given moment.
They compose your consciousness and create an idea of yourself.
When you think of what your identity is, you refer to these things, these preferences, when determining what that identity is and reflecting on yourself.
All of these component parts are fluid.
They change based on one's experiences that shape the component parts and one's environment.
All these things are subject to change.
While these things appear to be continuous on very small second to second scales, it becomes much more obvious over long periods of time that your identity and therefore yourself has changed dramatically.
For example, the person that I was as a two-year-old the preferences I held, the moral beliefs I had in my beliefs are nothing like the preferences I hold as a twenty-year-old.
While the amount of while the consciousness of my conscious experience seems to be continuous between that person that I was as a two-year-old and the person that I was as a twenty-year-old there's no continuation of those preferences and for all purposes for all meaningful purposes I'm a wholly distinct human being that as a twenty-year-old from who I was as a two-year-old and I wouldn't want the preferences or beliefs of myself as a two-year-old to bind me as a twenty-year-old.
Tattoos while yes they can be removed, are for the most part a permanent blemish on one's body.
They are something that generally are difficult to remove and many people don't have access to this type of removal and they can scar a person if the meaning behind them changes or the person themselves simply change to the point of regretting the decision.
We would not allow a distinct person to decide for me that I should have a tattoo even if our beliefs and identities are similar, even if the opinions that that person holds near the the opinions and beliefs that I hold exactly.
Because we would say that that is coercive for another unique person to make a decision for me with a long term impact.
Because of that long term impact we should not allow people to make that decision for their future selves because as I've explained that future self is for all intents and purposes and entirely distinct individual and should not held to the decisions of their past self.
Secondly, we think that the government should regulate obscenity.
We think that tattoos themselves are obscene and should be banned generally.
We think they're a blemish on the human form, that nature shaped that form through evolution and that form should be celebrated by each person rather than morphed based on these fleeting desires that you held at one point in your life.
We think tattoos are also associated with a culture that opposes social mores in the status quo.
They used as a marker to society as a whole that those mores are bad and people bask in the obscenity of their tattoos.
We think the government exists as a conglomeration of the body politic to protect and uphold society and tattoos undermine this.
We think thus the government has the power and the obligation to ban this obscene material, to ban people from getting tattoos and to make this type of regulation.
In addition to the fact that the future self is entirely distinct from the present self, the government needs to act to uphold these social mores.
For these reasons, tattoos should be banned."
"We should legalize insider trading.
In the status quo, individuals are unjustly punished for insider trading when all that they are doing is contributing to the total marketplace of information and ideas.
With that in mind, we would propose the following model.
That all individuals who do not control stock prices, that is to say everyone who works for a corporation but is not an executive, should be allowed to buy and sell stocks based on the information that they know.
That is to say they can buy and sell stocks for the company that they currently work for or any company that they have insider info for.
Additionally, we will allow the selling of information regarding stocks for all individuals.
This is to say if an executive would like to sell information regarding the company that would otherwise not be public, we will also allow that.
I have three arguments but first an overview.
Recognize that all executives have an obligation to stockholders.
That is to say, in the united states courts have past precedent and past case law which determines that if a executive or board of director attempts to change policy for a corporation which harms the stockholders, then that individual is liable for harms and can be jailed.
But we think this will do is guarantee that executives and other individuals will not arbitrarily inflate the price of their stocks or otherwise abuse their ability to have insider information to the harm of their company otherwise they could be charged in court which individuals just don't want.
With that three arguments.
First off, on equality second, on the signaling mechanism and third, on how this will reduce the total risk in portfolios.
Now why do you think this will increase equality?
In the status quo, individuals in poverty and individuals in the middle class cannot meaningfully invest.
Why is this?
They don't have enough money to get information.
They do not have enough experience investing in particular firms to actually get a meaningful profit.
A lot of the time whenever they invest it is a gamble and individuals do not like to speculate with their life savings.
With insider information these individuals can guarantee that they these stocks will increase in value.
This means that the individuals in poverty and at the middle class, those who aren't executives, will have the ability to invest in particular forms of equity and gain a higher profit even though they cannot purchase other information.
We think this is meaningful good and will generally raise individuals out of poverty and it guarantee they have a life savings which will help them into the future.
My second argument is about the signaling mechanism of insider trading.
The purpose of the market is generally to allocate resources for investment but also to signal what is popular and meaningful in our current society.
We live in a capitalist state which means that much of our decision making calculus depends on profit motives.
The stock market actually allows individuals to determine what interests individuals in the status quo.
By allowing insider information all that we do is increase the total amount of information available and usable in the stock market.
This will lead to better planning on behalf of the government, better planning on behalf of corporations, and generally a higher quality of life for all individuals.
My third argument is how this reduces risk.
We think that individuals prefer to invest in equity where the risk is -pensurate to the reward.
That is to say, incredibly high risk things must have very high rewards.
In the status quo, stocks have a decent amount of risk and a decent amount of reward.
By allowing individuals to use a specialized information we decrease the risk while keeping the reward the same.
This pushes out more risky asset things like options, things like stock calls, which would otherwise make individuals have a far greater risk than they take on when they invest in the stock market.
The result of this is that individuals can get a lot of money in the short term without having to risk their entire life savings.
The additionally, it means that you have fewer risky tools which can lead to financial crises.
Instead of investing in bundles where you can't identify the information, you invest in assets that you know the trajectory of.
For this reason, we should legalize insider trading."
"We should prohibit international adoption, for two big reasons.
First because it creates a perverse incentive against spending in domestic adoption infrastructure, which is vastly preferable to international adoption, and secondarily, because it can it carries a large degree of risk as being a front for bad things, like human trafficking.
So, let's talk about these things.
First, we'll talk about the perverse incentives that are created.
So, there's generally going to be, in most countries, political will against spending too much on adoption things.
Whether it's foster care systems, or similar infrastructure that makes it so that people, who are put up for adoption, are actually able to live good childhoods, and be prepared for later life.
So, the problem is is that, there is already going to be very few people that advocates for them, a lot of these these kids aren't going to have like political rights, or political agency, and they're not going to get that until after they're no longer really affected by the system, and it's also oftentimes difficult to find people who, on the list of issues, they want to advocate for, on like a social justice or movement level, to advocate for the like not not like massive, but still seizable number of people who are affected by the adoption system.
There's also general incentives against public spending on a lot of matters, and things like that, especially in developing countries, where overwhelmingly where the people are being put out for international adoption, by and large, you see people being adopted from developing countries, or maybe places in like, eastern europe, you don't see like americans being put up for adoption, and like a family in like namibia is adopting them, or angola things like that.
So this is important, because what this does is essentially creates an excuse for governments, and for society to let down these people, who are put up for adoption, but aren't one of the few lucky people that gets adopted by an international family.
Because, what it ultimately creates is like a where you can just push the problem to other countries, try and push the problem away, create a system that caters to international adoption.
But it creates an incentive in that, you're not actually going to fix more root problems, which I think is pretty bad.
I also think that, this is going to amplify a whole lot of biases, that are going to exist, because keep in mind that, when we are talking about international adoption, a lot of people are going to have certain preferences, maybe they're going to have preferences for, like, men over women, or things like that, and I think that a lot of these kinds of things, the people who get left behind, they could end up being minorities, they could end up being people who are otherwise disadvantaged, and that's not something that is very good, and they're not the people who should be getting the least support from the system.
But I think that the other thing that, it's important to talk about is the risk of human trafficking and the like, because keep in mind that, it's oftentimes very difficult to put checks in place.
Background checks can only get you so far, and especially if you haven't been caught for doing something yet, then you're not gonna have any kind of criminal record.
So, only the most obvious people are actually getting out of these kinds of things.
So keep in mind that, you're talking about taking people, like you could possibly be taking, like, infants from developing parts of the world, and putting them in the hands of who knows who?
Just about anyone that's willing to accept them, because there's always going to be more people eligible for adoption than people willing to take them.
And there's always going to be this pressure to push more people out into families that are willing to take them.
So, I think that this does create a lot of system where it's possible that these children won't be treated right, that these parents aren't going to be all that great, at the very best cases, or it may be more widespread parts of things like human trafficking, which are incredibly widespread, if under discussed, problems in international society, and the like.
So for all those reasons, we should prohibit international adoption."
"We should protect endangered species.
So in this debate, what we're saying is that countries around the world should create laws and take drastic action to prevent species from going extinct.
We see that conservation laws have been in place for about a hundred years in the US and some parts of europe and that they've been very effective at slowing the rate at which species go extinct.
But we think that even further action could be taken, by things like creating more national forest and extending this protection to more, different animals.
So, three arguments for you.
The first is that we tell you that current people ought not damage the environment in which future people will live.
We tell you that people who are alive today are not the sole owners of the earth, that future people have equal moral consideration with people who have been born right now.
What this means is that we have a moral obligation to leave the environment as we found it, for posterity.
We think that, for instance, when species go extinct because we failed to take action to preserve them that ultimately we, ultimately, we impoverish the experience that future people have in terms of being able to engage with the environment.
If you think about something like the great panda, clearly this has value to us culturally and aesthetically, and we think that future people have an equal claim to be able to enjoy that.
And in terms of other species which may have pragmatic benefits, such as genes that might be used to cure a rare disease, or species that might have other value for society that hasn't been discovered yet, we think that future people have an equal right to observe and discover these opportunities and to take advantage of them for the benefits that they may have for society in the future.
Our second argument is that there is an environmental value to conservation.
We tell you that it's often difficult to predict the effect that one species' extinction will have upon other species.
A type of grass, for instance, that grows in meadows, that people might not even notice on their way to work, that might just seem like it's no more valuable than any other grass, might provide a unique habitat for a species of butterflies, say.
We tell you that, ultimately, every species is connected and dependent on every other species.
But moreover, we tell you that as more and more species go extinct, the rate of extinction will increase.
Why is this true?
It's probably the case that an ecosystem can afford to lose a few species.
If you imagine an ecosystem is a web, where every species is touching, if you pluck out a few strings the entire web probably won't come unraveled.
But as you pluck out more and more strings, more and more of the remaining strings will come unraveled.
We tell you that a species have a harder and harder time adapting to the loss of other species.
Ultimately, you run the risk of entire ecosystems collapsing, which means that even very useful species or species that we care a lot about, could be put at risk by the extinction of species that right now we don't place a lot of value on.
Our last argument is that different species have an aesthetic value in and of themselves.
In other words, that we should prevent extinction because it is the loss of something that is irreplaceable and valuable in its own right.
We tell you that, for instance, while it might be true that buffalo don't do a lot for us day to day, that ultimately there is an aesthetic value to an environment that contains the buffalo and that particularly for some cultures, like certain native american tribes, this may be very significant to their religious or other cultural practices.
We think that species deserve to be conserved for this aesthetic value in and of themselves, and also for the aesthetic value that they impart to different communities or religious practices.
At the end of the day, we think that because it is impossible to replace a species once it is gone extinct, that it is uniquely important to ensure that as few species as possible are because we can't accurately measure their value right now and can't predict what it might be in the future.
So because of the rights of future people, because of the environmental value, and because of the aesthetic value of the species, we should protect endangered species.
Thank you."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should abolish the anti social behavior orders.
Two independent points.
First is that annoyance really shouldn't constitute a crime.
And what I mean by this is that you shouldn't have like significant impacts on your life by virtue of you know just sort of being annoying in public.
Obviously fines are a you know a reasonable thing to exert upon individuals who do something like for example you know busking in a public place that it's banned from or you know playing a gramophone off of your porch but something like a noise complaint probably doesn't merit really significant penalties.
And what the anti social behavior orders do in particular that does constitute a significant penalty is restriction of movement.
They are restricted from going to places, they are restricted from doing certain things in certain places, and that restriction on movement has a pretty significant impact on people's lives.
For example, if it's a public square that they're restricted from, because they were busking in it for example, that's a serious problem for that person.
Usually these public squares can you know be a place of work or be an important thoroughfare on your way to somewhere else and if you're restricting people from moving to public places that creates an undue burden on them.
But secondarily, it's a principled issue.
Because public places are designed for the public, it's not just something that we pay for with our taxpayer dollars, it's also something that's really significant in its capacity to you know actually create a sense of city or a sense of place.
This is something that belongs to the public in principle because it's something that our government you know constructed for the people in general.
So when you restrict individual people from accessing these places for what are relatively minor crimes, there's a serious principled issue here.
We think that restriction on freedom of movement is a significantly higher penalty then is justified for the nature of the thing that they did.
Our second independent point is the haphazard enforcement that is associated with the anti social behavior orders.
There's really two ways to approach this, the first is that the the orders themselves are a bit bizarre in their you know assorted nature that it's just basically a collection of things that people came up with and were like, this is kind of an annoying behavior, I don't like it we should stop people from doing it.
But it's not very principally consistent.
It's like specific things people might do in public that someone might find annoying, like playing a gramophone off your porch.
Because these are such specific, bizarre crimes, we think that there's a level of inconsistency in the criminal code then because you want your criminal code to be something that is you know has some sort of consistent principle running through it rather than just like a haphazard collection of like various like esoteric things that an individual might do.
But our second issue here, and I think this is really a lot more important, is the penalties themselves that are so haphazard.
These are often determined in very individualistic you know situations by you know justices or police officers and that's a problem because it means there isn't a consistent penalty for an individual crime.
Part of the point of the criminal justice system is to say when you do x, y will happen.
That's the structure of the deterrent system but it's also the structure of the fairness of the criminal justice system.
It's only fair in the first place because we understand that there is you know a specific penalty for a certain crime.
You know the basis of cruel and unusual punishment is that you know only certain things will happen to us if we commit a particular crime.
And when the punishments then for anti social behavior disorders are determined on such a case by case basis you lose that degree of consistency, you lose the capacity for the criminal justice system to say, we have consistency in our sentencing, in our penalties, and we have consistency in the way in which we you know tell people this is what will happen if you do y, and that's a problem.
We think that we should have a more consistent criminal code and we should get rid of these orders.
Proud to propose."
"Organ donations should be mandatory.
How do we see this working?
At the point where an individual dies, that individual's organs go to a registry, statewide registry or a national registry, whatever it is and from that registry, they can then be granted without the individual's permission, without their family's permission, to anyone in need of an organ.
The transplant list remains essentially the same way it is today, I.
E.
People get transplants based on need, based on severity, based on whether or not they're alcoholics, for example, things like that.
Crucially, we think there should be an opt out as opposed to an opt in, meaning today you have to actively sign to allow people to use your organs, tomorrow everyone is automatically signed to allow people to use their organs, and you can go through a committee, for example, to opt out if you have particular personal reasons, such as religious justification, for not being allowed or able to donate your organs after death.
We think it's likely that for religious reasons we'll exempt people, obviously for medical reasons we'll exempt people.
If somebody's organs are tainted, we're not going to use them.
If there are other reasons that are good enough, maybe we'll exempt people that way too.
Crucially, notice that in countries with opt-out programs today, such as denmark, for example, organ donation is at anywhere between eighty five and a hundred percent, meaning that even when you let people opt out for no reason, most people still end up donating their organs.
Two arguments we're going to make today.
One, on property and autonomy after death.
Why they, to an extent at least, cease to be and therefore, why these organs at the point of death no longer belong to you, and two, on market failure.
Crucially, on property and autonomy after death.
They're going to tell you that even if you don't maintain property or autonomy after death, you can deliver it away before death.
That is to say you can, much like you don't maintain your money after death but create a will, in which your money goes to the person or persons to whom you want it to go, you can do the same with your organs.
Note that falls on our side of the house.
Why?
A, it means the organs are going to someone.
B, it means the initial state is that the organs don't maintain under your control, much like with property.
If an individual does not write up a will and has no remaining heirs, for example, his property is not buried alongside him, right?
That property is taxed and taken by the state.
So that argument also falls on our side of the house.
Why is it that you don't maintain autonomy after death?
We say autonomy is something that is given to individuals with the ability to choose.
This is the reason that animals don't have autonomy, because they can't make rational choices.
This is the reason that children, to a great extent, don't have autonomy, because they don't have the cognizant cognitive facilities that enable them to make actual real-life choices.
This is a reason that fetuses aren't even considered human beings and can be aborted because they don't have that autonomy of choice, therefore they don't have autonomy over their body.
We say at the point that an individual dies, they lose autonomy over themselves.
This means that their faculties no longer belong to them.
This means that their organs no longer belong to them.
Now, to whom do they belong?
A, we say they belong to the state because the state facilitated their existence for a long time.
They did tihs through healthcare, they did this through through education.
But b, at the point at which they belong to nobody, we say the state is the best actor suited to give them to the people who most need them.
So even if they belong to nobody, they should go to the state.
Secondly, we say there's a market failure.
We say most people, if asked ten years after their loved ones died, would give away their organs happily.
The problem is you have to ask them at a point where they are so emotionally distraught that they can't imagine ripping into their loved one and taking something out of their body.
So, if people could make rational decisions regarding this, maybe we wouldn't need, as a government, to so so-called intervene.
It's not really intervention because it never really belonged to them after the point of death anyway.
But given that people can't even make this decision rationally by themselves, we're happy to say that it's a good place for a government to intervene in the market.
For these reasons, please propose."
"We should fight for palestinian independence.
What we mean by this is that we would prefer a world in which palestinian independence existed ie there would be a two state solution in which israel occupies a portion of their current land and palestine is provided with a livable piece of land as well it gets to be its own statehood its own representation and whatever international bodies it is a part of etcetera etcetera.
Three main areas of clash, first on rights.
I think first and foremost recognize the rights claim to the land that is currently israel and palestine is incredibly difficult to adjudicate if possible to adjudicate at all.
What I mean by this is that the individuals who claim israel's their right of birth because this is an area of their ancestors applies to both groups of individuals whether you are palestinian or an israeli.
This makes it incredibly difficult for any unilateral body to go in and say look this is the rightful owner of this land which means that this kind of conflict can literally rage at infinitum because there are always going to be people who are displeased with the outcome should there be a decision of one group over the other.
We also just think that this is a justification for the right of the individual to stay there.
If we think that israelis deserve to stay in israel because it is the home of their ancestors and therefore has been seated as the protective land by other international bodies this is an argument that also applies to palestinians and so ought be respected.
Both groups ought have a portion of that land.
But also I think it's important to note here that palestinians are stuck in an area of pseudo-citizenship where israel does not accept them as full citizens even if it treats them fine but we'd say that a lot of the time israel's actually quite cruel to a lot of palestinians especially on the border.
Doing things like cutting off aid coming into coming into palestinian territories allowing settlers to go in all of these are actions that are incredibly rights violative that are propagated by the israeli government and we think that insofar there is no way to create a world in which palestinians are viewed equally in israel and that is not a world that is preferable to either group the only natural solution would be to provide a palestinian independence.
Our second area of clash however is about why it's better for israel because recognize that there's a problem of differential fertility where should arabs or palestinians be given the same amount of citizenship as jews living in israel, they will out populate the jews there because they tend to have more children than israelis but also because there are simply more of them living in border towns than there are currently in israel.
This is really really bad because recognize that israel is an ideological state probably ought not be giving probably cannot maintain that ideology if they are if the people with the ideology are out populated by individuals of a different religion.
We think as such we as such it is always going to be a preferable alternative to israel to provide palestinians with their own state so that you can maintain a religious jewish ideological state because otherwise it is simply impossible.
You become a country that has a minority group ruling over a larger majority and that has never boded well through history.
But also it allows it it stops the rest of the world from doing the thing that we currently dislike so much where the UN constantly scapegoats and constantly calls out israel for their treatment of palestine and we know that in itself is important because when those things happen it delegitimizes israel in the broader sphere and prevents them from being able to accomplish what they actually want to do regarding their trade, regarding growth, and all things that we think you are prioritize if you want to build a good nation.
But finally let's talk about why the conflict is bad as a whole and why this solves it.
Currently both sides suffer due to the ongoing conflict of this of like the nation.
You have you have groups from both nationalities who really would prefer to just see the two state solution happen because it has been going on for so long which is why it currently polls of israeli youth show that the majority of them are pro the two state solution.
Look at the point this is a democratic solution as well as a preferable one end the conflict give them a state.
Proud to propose."
"We should raise the retirement age.
So, for the purpose of the debate, we're going to create a model that we think is fairly simple, we recognize that when the retirement age was created it didn't exist in a similar time, so the life expectancy, when the retirement age based around social security was instituted, was much lower, so what you would do is we would tie it to what life expectancy was when the retirement age was first instituted.
So, if whatever age it was, say it was sixty five, we would tie it to that, we would tie it to the same proportion of life that you would expect to have after retirement, based on the average, and from there we would just tie it to life expectancy moving forward, so if life expectancy goes up by two years, we would raise the retirement age in proportion to how much life you would expect to live after you retired, not based on your age per se, but based on expected retirement time.
Okay, so, two two main arguments that we have in this debate.
Firstly, we would say that this is a necessary thing to do, in order to protect the welfare benefits and other things that are so crucial, and so tied to retirement age.
So recognized that, the problem that exists in the status quo is one, in which for the vast majority of the existence of mankind, the pyramid or the amount of people at each age group, so from zero to ten, from ten to twenty, from twenty to thirty, etcetera, essentially formed a pyramid where the vast majority of people on the bottom were under ten years of age, and the people at the top, the very few, were much smaller proportion.
So, what's actually happening in the status quo is that, because of increased medical care, lowering birthrates, and all of these types of things, that pyramid pattern, that put a very few amount of people at the top, and a lot of people at the bottom, as far as age range, is actually straightening out.
So, there are now many more people that are at the top, more people are living to be older, more people are able to collect the benefits of retirement, and all these things, whereas there are very few people now that are being born, compared to the proportion of elderly.
What this means is that, all the systems, that we have devised, are based on the fact that you have a much larger working class of people than you do the amount of people that are retired, but that isn't the case anymore.
There are now many more people that are able to collect retirement benefits than before, and while we recognize that retirement is something that people have earned, that they put their time in, and they deserve to have a time after they've retired to be able to live their life, to have the freedom to explore other things, to enter that new stage of life, it's important to recognize that, if we don't make a change now, people will not be able to receive the same welfare benefits they have before.
People won't social security is due to take a drastic hit, because of higher life expectancy, and lower birth rates, and other sorts of welfare are doing the same.
It also means that, the economic productivity of these people can last longer, because people are able to live longer, and because better medical care means you're able to do more at sixty two or sixty one than you were able to do fifty sixty years ago.
It means that, their labor is value is valuable economically, and because we don't think that the retirement age is anything but an arbitrary line, we think we ought create a retirement age that best reflects a median, or a meeting point, between the ability for people to live meaningful lives after they've retired, but also the necessity for these people to contribute into welfare programs, so that current generations are able to receive those benefits.
We think that everyone is entitled to those benefits, and without a drastic change occurring right now, it simply the case that in the future, people will not be able to collect the benefits and be able to retire at the same age.
Given that this is, frankly, a necessity of changing demographics, and given that people will still be able to live a meaningful life post-retirement, given the rasing given the the mortality the raising life expectancy, and things of that nature.
We think it's absolutely crucial that we raise the retirement age, and in fact we should raise the retirement age."
"We should increase immigration to the united states.
In this debate we're going to present two main arguments as to why we think immigration is a positive for the united states and indeed for the world.
Firstly, economic arguments and secondly, social arguments.
So under economic arguments we have a few main points.
Firstly, we would say that increasing immigration to the united states increases both the output of the united states economically, but also the potential tax base from which the united states can draw resources.
What this means is that with an increased amount of tax revenue, you can provide more social welfare for the united states, for the citizens of the united states, and you can ensure that more benefits are being paid out to people in bulk.
And what's good about increased tax revenue is that even though there are more people that that tax revenue needs to go to serve when you when you bring that tax revenue together you can do large projects that end up being cheaper per capita than they otherwise would be if you were to subsidize those those products or those projects, such as infrastructure projects, roads, bridges, etcetera, schools, if you had less tax revenue or or a smaller base to draw that revenue from.
Secondly, we think you can increase on low skilled labor supply.
This is important because, as it stands in the united states, there are thousands of jobs that the average american citizen simply does not want to do because it requires arduous labor, intensive amounts of hours, and lots of work and hardship that most americans have too much privilege to want to accept.
These incrude this these include agricultural jobs, manufacturing jobs, etcetera.
But these are still valuable jobs for the united states economy and for small businesses all across america and by bringing in more low skilled labor we think you're more likely to get those jobs fulfilled and increase the productivity of american businesses.
You can also increase competition for skilled labor.
So by bringing in people that are of the best and brightest of foreign countries, we think that you create more competition for skilled labor because you bring in more qualified bodies.
We think while this may detract from some people's ability to get jobs as citizens of the united states, we think it also improves US businesses and ensures that they're drawing from the most capable labor pool possible and therefore are more likely to be able to out-compete international competitors.
We also think that finally, an influx of new immigrants to the united states will also bring innovation in terms of what businesses are likely to open up new ideas and fresh ideas to the market that can increase the types of competitive competitive businesses and firms that exist in the united states.
Okay secondly social arguments.
We would say that cultural exchange exchange has a number of benefits.
Firstly, it promotes tolerance.
We think in a world in which most people interact with people that look like them and have similar experience as them and very little experience with those from other nations, we think that people often stereotype those that live outside the united states and in instances such as the islamophobia that exists in the united states, we think that this also this often breeds hostility in the global sphere.
We think that by bringing in more immigrants you're less like you're likely to get contact between people from the united states and other and foreigners that is more likely to show these people these people that have these islamophobic and another prejudiced tendencies that these other people are just like them and it's more likely to bridge the empathy gap that currently exists.
We also think it provides new opportunities for US citizens such as new outlets for entertainment in in new social groups that we think can can be incredibly fulfilling, especially to people that feel out like outsiders in their currently in their current community.
Finally, we would say that given the amount of privilege that people have in the united states, we think that that privilege should be extended to all people around the globe.
We think that just because you're born in the united states doesn't mean that you're deserving of the democratic system and the rights that are afforded to citizens that are born here.
We think that those opportunities should be expanded to as many people as possible and only through immigration to the united states can that be possible and can the united states be an ethical global superpower.
For these reasons we should increase immigration to the united states."
"We should abolish homework.
Ultimately, while homework may be useful for some people, it's not beneficial to all students.
So we think it would be preferable if students spent more time at school in a structured environment at the expense of not spending time outside of school working necessarily on their school work.
So our first argument is about reducing pressures on students.
The US in particular has a massive problem with depression and anxiety among young people.
Many teenagers kill themselves or try to kill themselves every year especially in high school and we see that the rates of mental illness among high school students are extremely high.
One reason why the rate of mental illness has probably gone up in recent years is because of the increasing demands on student's time.
Ultimately, high school students are under a huge amount of pressure to get into a good college and that means studying an inordinate amount because they have to have absolutely perfect grades and also doing huge amounts of extra curricular activities to prove that they're well rounded for these holistic college applications.
It's true that american children don't go to cram school, more on that in just a minute, but the demands on their time are still enormous and many students are working on either extra curriculars or school work from literally the moment they wake up until the moment they go to bed while they're in high school and have no meaningful free time or opportunities to be children.
So ultimately, we think that by removing homework, which in many cases has ballooned to ridiculous proportions for student spending hours and hours on homework every night, by abolishing this homework we would free up time for students to actually have time to themselves and also to work on things that interest them rather than just whatever is going to look the best on their common application for yale and harvard.
At the end of the day, it is imperative that we deal with the public health crisis that is youth mental health and abolishing homework would go a long way towards improving this since homework is one of the largest external factors in harming young people's mental state.
But our second argument is that homework also isn't a very good way to teach people things.
It's true that some subjects are always going to require that students do practice in order to get better.
You have to do a certain amount of algebra problems before you learn how to use the quadratic equation.
You have to learn your spanish verb conjugations and all of those kind of things.
But there's no reason why this has to be done at home rather than at school.
We think that if there was more pressure on teachers to use classroom time effectively, something that many secondary school teachers just don't pay any attention to and also if there were more opportunities for students to get their work done in a very focused, productive environment like a study hall, that ultimately students could devote less time and get the same outcomes in terms of mastering skills through repetition.
So we don't think that homework is pedagogically necessary for students to actually be able to learn the skills that they need to learn in school.
In fact, we think that homework sometimes gets in the way of students learning.
When students are forced to devote a huge amount of time to doing practice problems or filling out verb charts no matter what they actually struggle with, homework can actually get in the way if they're learning the things that do give them a hard time.
Many students have different needs that aren't going to be met by one size fits all homework.
After all, an assignment that might help the majority of people in class might not help someone who lacks a basic foundation or might not help a student who needs more advanced work because they already understand what's going on in the class.
Oftentimes those pupils are simply given more work, that only intensifies the burdens on their time that I talked about in our first argument.
So we think that it would be better if we could tailor the work to individual students rather than give a one size fits all homework and having more one-on-one time with teachers and a longer school day might be an effective way to do that.
For all of these reasons, we should abolish homework.
Thank you."
"Surrogacy should be banned.
So, by this we mean a practice in which people who want to have a child but, for whatever reason, are unable to will enter into a contract with a woman and she will bring a child to term on behalf of those people and then give up the child to them legally when the baby is born.
So, normally, you have a contract that's signed where the woman agrees to bring the child to term and then turn it over once it's born and these people will pay for medical expenses and sometimes women will even accept money in return.
So, you have instances when it's done for altruistic reasons and instances when it's done for commercial reasons.
So, with that in mind, we think both types of surrogacy should be banned.
Two arguments: first is that we think that surrogacy contracts are inherently exploitative towards the biological mother.
We think that effectively what you see with surrogacy is that young women are being pressured into selling their body and their health at great risk, and in other instances, society wouldn't accept this, so they shouldn't accept it now.
We think that it's very difficult for someone who's never been pregnant to internalize the harms of pregnancy.
We think that things like your ability to work during pregnancy and your ability to carry out your daily life vary tremendously from person to person and from pregnancy to pregnancy.
Obviously, no two pregnancies are the same, as any mother of multiple children will tell you.
So, we think that it's very difficult for the young mother, particularly if she's never done this before or never been pregnant before, to actually internalize the risk that she's taking and then set a fair price.
So, we think that what's very likely to happen is that prices will be set artificially low and then that in order to compete, anyone who wants to become a surrogate will be forced to set the price lower than they actually should, based on the risk.
But because many of the people who enter into surrogacy contracts will probably be people who were in a financially difficult situation and aren't really free to negotiate, we think that they're effectively being taken advantage of by wealthier families who want to conceive these children.
And I'd also like to point out that there's tremendous potential for abuse.
You might see a partner or a parent pressure a young woman into agreeing to be a surrogate, despite the health risks, despite the potential harms, in order to get money out of them.
Now, society prevents women from having sex for money and doing other acts that would let them basically sell their body and their well-being for financial benefit.
So, we don't think that you should allow this policy which is effectively the same thing.
The risks are very much the same as prostitution, so we don't think that you should allow it if you're not okay with that.
Our next argument then is about why we think these contracts are unenforceable and ultimately not good for the state to permit.
So, recognize that in the status quo, the only time that you can take away a baby from its mother is if she is mistreating it or has been shown by the court to be unable to care for the child.
Otherwise, almost every government around the world really reprioritizes letting a child stay with its mother.
So, we think that the result of that is if you have an instance where someone brings this child to term and wants to keep it in violation of the surrogacy contract, it's going to be very difficult to actually enforce that contract because you're in a really difficult situation.
Either the court upholds a surrogacy contract and takes away a baby from its mother or the court overturns the contract and these people lose their money.
We think that either situation is really undesirable and we think that this will be a common problem.
We think that many times, it's probably going to happen that a mother will have the child and then naturally feel an attachment towards that child and want to keep it, even though it's a violation of the contract, so we think that this is likely to be a big problem.
This is probably going to clog up the courts and we also think that these trials are unlikely to be fair.
We think that since the couple who wants to have a surrogate mother is probably very wealthy since this process is expensive, that they're always going to get better representation and they will win cases unfairly, simply because they can hire better attorneys or better represent themselves.
But on top of that, we think that because this issue is so fraught it would be better for the courts to avoid it entirely, and the only way to do that is to ban surrogacy.
So, ultimately, because we think surrogacy is unfair to the mothers and because we think that these contracts are going to be difficult to uphold and lead to a lot of problems for the courts, surrogacy should be banned."
"We should abolish intelligence tests.
Intelligence tests are inherently flawed frameworks and metrics by which individuals are tested on skills that they do not need to apply in the area where intelligence tests are regularly used.
We think they are structurally inaccurate, largely give inaccurate results due to context, and are used for incredibly problematic and ineffective results.
As such, we would support the following model: that intelligence tests be banned in school and work, that governments have no ability to use intelligence tests, that corporations have no ability to use them either.
We'll still allow basic knowledge tests for things like police work, where individuals need to know the codes or literally how to operate a particular piece of machinery to even have the job.
But we think general intelligence tests, general IQ tests, will be banned.
We'll also allow generally false organizations like mensa to continue peddling their BS as we don't think that individuals will necessarily change their opinions based on what governments actually decide to do.
Three arguments then: first on why intelligence tests are structurally inaccurate.
We think that questions will always have a bias.
This is particularly true with english literature and logic questions.
When a question is framed in a certain mindset or framed in terms that are used that a particular participant is used to they will do better.
If they are not, the individual will will do worse.
As the question becomes more vague, all people will do worse.
As the question becomes more specific, most people will do better but usually you have to go to a certain camp.
As such there will always be disparate results among individuals and the course instructors will have to choose a particular group to prefer.
They usually choose straight white men which largely leads them having the highest scores on intelligence tests and leading to a structural barrier to people of color and women as they have less access to the reins of power as intelligence tests bar them from higher level classes and better jobs.
We also think the very premise of them is inherently bias.
You cannot test everyone's knowledge.
If someone can repair every sprinkler in the state, repair every car in the state but generally isn't that good at algebra, they're still incredibly intelligent.
Intelligence tests though would tell them that they're an idiot and would put them in jobs and classes that they simply should not be in.
Because it is impossible to test all intelligence even in the realms of math, literature, and science, we think intelligence tests are inherently bad.
But we also think that they have a number of contextual inaccuracies as well.
We think that individual on a day to day basis can have incredibly different results.
If someone feels sick or well they will do incredibly differently.
If they eat a healthy breakfast versus an unhealthy breakfast or nothing, they will do better or worse.
If the weather is better they'll do better.
If the wetter weather is worse they'll do worse.
If the weather is incredibly dreary then they'll probably actually better if they have nothing to focus on.
We also think the facility changes things.
If you're in a school that is beat up or generally does not have policies in terms of kids walking down the hall and playing music, that can distract you.
As such, there's it is impossible to eliminate all of the structural inaccuracies which generally makes it so individuals cannot actually take these tests under sterile conditions and the results will always be flawed.
This brings me to my third argument regarding their poor usage.
We think that people are put into classes they don't need.
If someone scores poorly on an intelligence test they'll usually be put in remedial classes where the teacher is less prepared, is less willing to teach.
These are the students need the most focus and yet we are putting them in the worst classes with the worst resources.
As such, intelligence tests should be banned to prevent this from happening.
We also think that workers with no experience regularly get hired because of these tests.
We see this in computer science all the time where someone may be able to pass a written test from an employer but then has no abilities to work on the job.
Because there is no effective usage and because they're inherently inaccurate, intelligence tests should be abolished."
"Teacher tenure reform brings more good than harm.
When we're talking about teacher tenure reform we're not talking specifically about the elimination of tenure altogether, what we think this looks most like is a reform in a couple of ways.
Firstly, we think that the way that teachers would get tenure under a reform system is rather one that's based on longevity teaching, is rather one that is based on improvement of students in the way that we think that you can create this is having students, say, take standardized tests prior to and following the end of a course and seeing their relative improvement.
So not necessarily proficiency but rather the degree to which students improve under a teacher.
We thing that is a system that fairly assesses the actual impact of the teacher, and we think that ten year rather than being a permanent system could be something that is moderated so that if you receive tenure it would be more like a five year guarantee of a job rather than a permanent guarantee of a job, or a five year or some sort of other marginalized amount of time in which teachers wouldn't be able to be fired without a just cause or something like that.
We think that this is a good balancing to ensure that there is still reason for people to become educators.
That there's still a benefit to becoming an educator and some sort of job security that comes with that, but we think that it also combats the worst problems that come with tenure which I'm going to talk about now.
So we think that what tenure ends up doing is that it ensures that teachers that are of lower quality get to keep their jobs and status quo.
We think that this has dramatic impacts on students across the board.
We think that firstly what tenure does is that once there's a permanent guarantee that you're not going to lose your job, it means that teachers that are not entirely motivated to help their students, so not the best teachers.
We think that the best teachers are likely going to remain motivated to try and improve their students, but we can that those below that tier, those that were just able to get tenure or those that have been around for a long period of time, we think that what tenure does is that it doesn't lead them to innovate in the way that they act in the classroom nor does it lead them to motivate their students to become learners because once someone has been guaranteed the fact that their job is secure there's no real motivation or reason that they need to to go anywhere beyond what is necessarily required of them, and we think that many educators after especially those that have tenure, those that have been working for say ten, twenty years, we think that those that were in the system for a long period of time are often those that are most worn down by the system and this means that those that have had tenure for the longest period of time are often going to be the worst teachers.
We think that the impacts on students because of this are clear.
When students are not motivated to learn by their teachers we think that their likely going to try and slack off in class, they're less likely to take learning rigorously.
I personally have been in a room where a teacher left the teaching to students, where this is a teacher that had tenure and said we're going to I'm going to let you teach your peers and we think that this is a system that is incredibly problematic because it puts the responsibility of learning onto the on to the students but also the responsibility of teaching themselves.
I would point the point of a teacher kinda becomes obsolete.
We think that when you have tenure reform you're likely going to get people more motivated to work hard because they need to continually show proficiency in order to be guaranteed that tenure spot and once someone has tenure, there's no longer this permanent slacking that they can do.
There's no longer this permanent system in which they don't need to try and improve their students.
They don't need to try and prove themselves as a teacher because five, ten years however long it may be down the line when they need to get tenure again, or when they need to keep their job, they can simply revert to showing they can simply revert to the bad ways and the bad practices that teachers with tenure have done in the status quo.
We think that tenure reform is the best way to insure that teachers still get the benefits that are owed to the best teachers while ensuring that the worst teachers don't stay in the system, don't dilute the education that students have, and don't force the responsibility of educating on to the students themselves and motivate them to become lifelong learners.
We think that a system that exists in the status quo is never going to be sufficient in achieving that and that's why teacher tenure reform will do more more good than harm."
"We should abolish needle exchange programs.
So by needle exchange programs we basically mean, a place where people who use drugs that require injections can go and get more needles in exchange for turning in used needles.
So these are normally targeted at heroin users for instance who are using needles to inject heroin they can go in and turn in old needles and get new clean ones that have been sterilized.
So that's the program, but we don't think that it actually works.
Two reasons why it should be abolished.
One, these programs don't actually do anything to help drug addicts.
The idea behind these programs is that people will go in, and they'll turn in all their dirty needles and replace them with sterile needles, and as a result , things like HIV won't get spread as much, and blood borne infections and illnesses will ultimately not be spread around, and the drug using community will ultimately be safer as a result, and therefore they'll have lower healthcare costs and be less of a burden on society.
But, what actually happens, is these programs just add more needles to the supply.
Basically, addicts will take in a few needles and be given way more clean needles in exchange.
We don't see that many of these programs enforce a strict one to one exchange, so what this really does is make it easier to get a hold of hydroponic needles to use for drug use, rather than, keep the supply the same but replace all the bad ones with good ones.
So at the end of the day these only facilitate worst decision making.
Because needles are cheaper, and people have easier access to them so there's less of a barrier to using these drugs, ultimately we think that it's more likely that people have an easier time doing drugs like heroin because of the existence of these needle exchange programs.
But also, when the government of san francisco or wherever is instituting this program creates this facility that normalizes drug use, these people see that they're engaging with the city in the same way that anyone else would by going and using a public service, but for them it's used to get heroin into their veins.
So we see that this normalizes the act of using these drugs, and ultimately makes it seem more acceptable than it should be in our society.
We still want to make it clear, that these drugs are unacceptable and we don't think you can do that with needle exchange programs.
Second, these harm the communities where they're placed.
So, first of all, we think that these programs attract addicts into a community.
Where, if you go and build this in an area, then most like you're going to have lots of people who are addicted to drugs coming in to take advantage of this service, probably nobody who lives in that community wants this to happen.
Why is that true?
So say you've just gone in gotten some needles from the needle exchange program.
Your next question is probably, how do I get more drugs to use these needles?
And that's likely to lead to things like petty theft and begging and other undesirable behavior that people don't want to see in their community.
We think that oftentimes these needle exchange programs are built without the consent of the people who would be living nearby.
Everyone will probably be okay with this in the abstract, but nobody wants a needle exchange program on their block, or downstairs from their apartment.
Because they don't want these unsafe drug users around who might be violent or might be thieves, and they're worried about their neighborhood as a whole going down hill.
This is likely to harm the reputation of a neighborhood, as it seems to be the kind of place where drug addicts hang out, and also to lead to it losing residents and social services.
Because we think that a neighborhood gets into a spiral where it starts out as a fine neighborhood, and then more drug addicts come in, and then it becomes less safe, and then people don't want to move there, so the residents remaining behind are the people who can't leave, and ultimately this leads the city to provide it with less services because it has fewer people, and the people who live there don't pay as much in tax, and this harms the quality of life for the people who can't move.
Whether they be pensioners or other people who for some reason can't leave the area.
So we think that building these needle exchange programs it's unfair to those people, even if it might be good for the addicts.
But because we've shown you that addicts don't benefit and that communities don't benefit, we think we should abolish needle exchange programs.
Thank you."
"We should subsidize embryonic stem cell research, because stem cell research is absolutely fantastic, and comes with little to no real ethical consequences.
So, let's start by talking about why stem cell research is so important, and why it's so good.
I think that we can break down the categories of problems, that stem cell research can solve, into two big groups: the problems of curing something, and the problems of costs of cures being inaccessible or too expensive.
So, let's start by talking about the problems of cures altogether.
There is a lot of things that we don't have the capacity to cure in the status quo.
We don't have the capacity to cure a lot of nerve damage that can be occurred, a lot of things like paralysis, there is a lot of kinds of disfigurement, that can be permanent in a lot of ways, stem cell creates an opportunity to actually cure these, previously incurable, things, because by ever increasing and better research, we have a way that we can program stem cells, so that they can replace whatever damaged cells are.
So, for example, if somebody maybe suffers brain damage, and you don't just make new brain cells, in the way that you make skin cells, you can now maybe possibly even help somebody with that brain damage, by programming these stem cells to become replacement brain cells.
This is like incredible technology.
This can change people's lives, people that have been living with problems for life long, can have cures for these kinds of problems.
Additionally, it can also help with problems of excessive costs and unavailability.
Because in the status quo, when you need to replace something, like let's say you need to replace a kidney, or like a liver, or something, like well probably not a liver, but like a kidney, or maybe a heart transplant, or something like that, when these things happen in the status quo, you need to wait for some kind of donor, or you need to like spend a whole lot of money on synthetic products, and things like that.
So a lot of these things are oftentimes difficult to access to, because like organ donation not a lot of people are always on organ donation list, a lot of people don't end up giving things, a lot of organs are vital and you can't donate them, you have to worry about a person being a match to you as well, there's a whole lot of barriers in place that make it difficult, for a lot of people to get access to this.
This is especially important given that, oftentimes we're talking about emergencies, you can't just wait for a heart transplant if you need one.
So, stem cells create an opportunity to solve a lot these problems, because you can essentially take stem cells, they can be a perfect match for the they can to completely replace just about anything, and they can be created as like a match to the person itself that is needing a treatment.
So, it can solve a lot of problems in that way too.
So, finally let's talk about moral costs, and why I think that the moral costs, like ethical implications are pretty much nonsense.
So, there's a couple of reasons for this, first and foremost, by and large, most most stem cells don't actually come from aborted fetuses, they come from things that would be maybe regularly discarded as a part of birth anyway, they can be stem cells that maybe are like clones, or they just come from other organs, like a lot of stem cells don't necessarily come from aborted fetuses in the first place, they just kind of exist, so there's really no reason why you shouldn't just study them.
But, even if they do come from aborted fetuses, it's not like were making babies for the explicit purpose of aborting them so we got their stem cells.
These are, by and large, people who are getting abortions anyway, that'll continue getting abortions anyway, and they're donating stem cells to science, which, for the life of me, I don't understand why is a problem, you can donate your body to science upon death, if you consented to doing so, it's like basically recycling, and it does good to society, there's no reason why it's a bad thing.
And the great benefits, even if there are ethical implications, the massive massive health benefits this can help, the lives that this can save is simply more important.
So, for those reasons subsidize stem cell research."
"Brings more harm than good.
In this debate, we're going to talk primarily about two outcomes that we think are specifically derived from the increased use of the internet.
Firstly, we're going to talk about shorter attention spans and the cultural implications of such, and secondly, we're going to talk about the impact of technology and the addiction to technology on our health.
So, recognize that the internet is inextricably linked with the increased use of computers, the increased use of smartphones, technology.
The internet is a central focal point of the technological evolution that has occurred over the last twenty or thirty years, let's say.
We think that therefore you can derive a lot of the impacts the internet simply from looking at the technology that we use and how we use it.
So, firstly, let's talk about shorter attention span.
The internet has allowed for content to be created in a way that has never before been possible, which means that there is much more content available for entertainment and much more content information available to be consumed, which means that individuals can go to many different sources to receive different types of utility and different types of pleasure.
What we think this means is that it creates a norm of individuals being able to receive instant gratification, which means that individuals are less capable of waiting to derive their gratification from their activities.
We think that this is a problem for a few reasons.
Firstly, it leads to individuals having shorter attention spans, which means they're less able to or they're less capable and less willing to grapple with really complex issues that may not be immediately available immediately capable for them to understand, so we think that people are less likely to go through intellectual rigor when they're used to being able to receive instant gratification.
Secondly, we think it leads to a norm where long term planning is less normalized.
So what we mean by this is that life planning requires many different types of financial outlays, and different types of plans being put in place that allow you to have security into the future.
We think that when individuals are more momentary oriented, so more oriented into the present, we think that they're less likely to do the types of things that can ensure that in the long run they're able to have they're able to have these types of deep plans for their future.
And finally, we think that the instant gratification and the short attention spans lead to individuals being less interpersonally related to each other.
We think that individuals, because of the internet, are by far less able to have face to face interactions and are less capable of holding deep and personal relationships over long periods of time.
We think that normal human life isn't as fast paced as the internet, isn't as dramatic as the internet, isn't as capable of evolution as the internet, but it's still an essential part of what makes human life worth living, the interpersonal interactions, and we think the internet has trained us not to be as capable of holding these types of interactions.
So, lastly, we're going to talk about the health impacts of the internet, because we think they also exist.
The way that individuals currently use their free time, their entertainment on the internet is largely by spending their time in bed, sitting on their couch, sitting in front of their TV, or sitting in front of a screen, which is not what we are biologically determined to do, it's not what our biology has created us for.
Our bodies are made to be active, our bodies are made to move and to do activity, to stand, to walk, not to spend our life sitting on the couch or sitting in front of a screen.
Our eyes aren't made to use screens as constantly, they are an impact, our eye our vision is getting worse.
Our hands are not made to type on computers and to hold controllers to play games on the internet.
All of these types of things are dependent and seen on the internet has long term implications on our health.
Simply from the way we position our bodies to the impact that has on our posture, to our vision, to our hearing, all these things are impacted by an increased addiction to technology that isn't natural, that have long term implications on the health of individuals, and we think that this, coupled with the impacts that the internet has brought upon our society about upon the way that we interact with each other, and about the functioning that we're able to do as individuals, we think that for all these reasons the internet has clearly brought more harm than good."
"We should ban alcoholic beverages.
So, by this we mean ban the sale in any given country of things like beer, wine and liquor.
We think that we're only talking about usage for, you know, personal enjoyment, we're not talking about any potential medical usage or religious things like administering christian sacraments.
So, with that in mind, we have two main arguments for why we should ban the sale of alcoholic beverages: the first is about why we think there's a need for the state to intervene to prevent people from buying alcohol.
We think there are many third party harms, many innocent people who are harmed because of others' alcohol use.
Healthcare costs are driven up dramatically by systematic and habitual use of alcohol throughout many countries.
Alcohol is responsible for about four and a half percent of the global cost of healthcare every single year and we tell you that the cost is much higher per capita in certain countries where alcoholism is actually more prevalent.
So, we don't think that everyone should be burdened with higher healthcare costs as society struggles to, like, basically accommodate some people's choice to use alcohol for fun.
We also tell you that drunk drivers pose a huge threat to people in many countries around the world and that even in countries with strong rule of law and relatively safe roads, drunk driving is still a major issue.
We tell you that there is no good solution to this problem other than to end the sale of alcohol and that this is justified because ultimately, people have to drive in order to get where they need to go, in order to work, to go to school, whereas alcohol is simply something that people enjoy using, it's clearly a lower order of concern.
Our last point is that we think that alcohol feeds into many forms of abuse and other antisocial behavior here.
So, we tell you that oftentimes, instances of neglect or child or spousal abuse are linked to people drinking.
Many people become angry when they drink and are otherwise not able to control themselves and act in an appropriate way.
So, we think that banning alcohol would actually reduce spousal abuse and other forms of abuse and make society safer for women and children and generally, everyone.
So, the next reason for state intervention is the gap in information between people who produce alcohol and people who consume it.
So, we tell you that first of all, alcoholism is grossly misrepresented in society.
Alcoholism is a disease and it's probably genetic for many people and we tell you that most people don't understand this, that alcoholism runs in their family and that they can get it even if they try to behave as responsibly as possible.
So, we think that at the point where there's no way to prevent people from being taken advantage of through alcoholism, we ought step in and regulate the sale of alcohol.
Alcohol also causes cancer and many other health impacts and we think that most people are unaware of the fact that they're much more likely to get things like throat or mouth cancer because of drinking than they would if they didn't drink.
So, we think that the state should intervene there.
In addition, alcohol inhibits many types of health care treatment because of many drug interactions and we think that people are not adequately informed of that and never will be because it's not in the interest of the alcohol industry.
So, we think that there's a need for state intervention because of the harms to a third party and also because of the lack of information for consumers.
But next, we think that our second point is about principle consistency.
We already ban other similar substances.
There's no other psychoactive substance that is as easy to access and as widely accepted by society as alcohol, but we don't think that the law should favor one particular cultural choice or social choice over others.
We don't think that it's the place of the law to say that it's acceptable to become intoxicated on alcohol and not on the herbs that have traditionally been used by the native peoples of north america or marijuana or other substances that have been used around the world.
We think that that's effectively saying that one type of lifestyle is better than others even if the outcomes are often the same.
We think that even if there's no way to perfectly enforce the law, principally, it ought be consistent for people of different lifestyles and different cultures, whereas allowing alcohol favors certain cultures over others when you ban the types of intoxicants that are favored by those cultures.
So, we think therefore, that it's clear that principally you ought ban alcohol and also that there is a need for the state to intervene to do so.
Thank you."
"We should abolish bit coins.
So we think that a group of countries the world's largest economies like that the US european union countries and china should come together to crackdown on bitcoin and prevent it from being purchased sold or used within their countries.
We have a few arguments for our side.
The first is that bit coin is largely used for black market purchases.
Now I know that in recent years bit coin advocates have started talking about how legitimate businesses are accepting bitcoin and you can even use it to buy a cup of coffee in some cities but really bit coin exists to buy things that are illegal.
The reason why people go through such great lengths in order to buy a bit coin is so that they can purchase something without being tracked by the government.
If you went and bought a huge amount of drugs for instance with US dollars the government could track the serial numbers of those dollar bills and if you were stupid enough to pay with a credit card that will be very easy to track.
But with a bit coin you can buy lots of drugs or pay for illegal services like prostitution where that's illegal and you would be able to get away with it because no one could track the payment method.
It would be completely anonymous and out of the government's control.
So when people do things like order drugs over the internet they want to pay with bit coins.
So we think that because this is pretty clearly a way to avoid law enforcement and make it easier to consume illegal drugs or pay for illegal services that bit coin should be abolished because it's a threat to the rule of law.
Ultimately even if bit coin isn't doing anything wrong in and enough itself the fact that it exists to facilitate illegal behavior is still sufficient to ban it.
We see that this is true in other ways as well you can't own the tools to break into a car certain locksmith tools in a lot of cities even though the locksmith tools don't do anything wrong in and of themselves because they really only would be purchased for nefarious purposes.
Bit coin is the same way and by the same principle we ought stop people from being able to buy and use it.
And while some people might intend to use their bit coins for legitimate purposes ultimately we think that those people should know that what they're doing is making it easier to commit crimes and that they're not completely innocent in and of themselves.
Our second argument is about tax avoidance in the same way that we can't track purchases with bitcoin we also can't track bit coin for tax purposes.
So if you have a business that is billing people in bitcoin they could very easily avoid paying the tax that they owe to the state because ultimately the IRS would have a hard time proving that they had a certain amount of money in their accounts.
At the same time people who pay with bitcoin don't have to ultimately commit to paying sales tax or other taxes that they ought to when they spend that money.
But this even goes beyond that.
Many people might transfer money between countries using bitcoin in order to avoid paying tax in a country that has relatively high tax rates.
So it also becomes a way to funnel money out of the country illegally.
So in the same way that it facilitates illegal transactions it also facilitates tax avoidance.
We think that in the same way that we could step in for illegal transactions we can also ban bit coin if it's being used as a way for people to avoid paying their taxes.
After all we would be very suspicious of people who were trying to take thousands of dollars in cash out of their country.
We ought be equally suspicious if people are trying to take thousands of dollars of bit coins out of the country.
So ultimately this doesn't work any differently than smuggling cash or gold or other valuables the same kind of thing that you might have to declare when you enter the european union or the united states but people are able to get away with it because it's untrackable.
So ultimately because in these two ways bi coin poses a threat to the rule of law we ought abolish bit coin.
Thank you."
"We should not subsidize agriculture.
In this round, we're talking about whether or not agricultural businesses deserve to have subsidies by the federal or state governments and our side would of course say that no subsidy should be given under any circumstances to these businesses.
So we have two main arguments today.
The first of which is about market inefficiencies and the second is a comparative.
So firstly, on market inefficiencies, recognize that developing countries in the status quo have a massive market advantage on producing agriculture and goods.
The reason for this is that the regulations in the agricultural industry are simply much less than that in developed countries like the united states and there are also wage laws that exists in the united states that set minimum wages that simply don't exist elsewhere.
The congregation of different sorts of regulations and wage regulations that exist in the united states means that developing nations will always be at a competitive advantage within a free market in producing agriculture.
So given that this is the case when we subsidize agriculture we're simply trying to ensure that a domestic product can continue to be produced even though we can get equally good equally valuable and worthwhile products from other areas.
So we're simply doing this to ensure that domestic companies can maintain their business.
The problem with this is that while many people have an understanding of agriculture that small farmers and mom and dad farms trying to build up their farms and make a living, this simply isn't how agriculture works in the status quo in america and other developed nations.
The way that agriculture actually works in the status quo is a system in which big agro and big farm businesses have control over many many smaller farms but still it's a multi it's a large corporations that control and produce the vast majority of food within the united states.
What this means is that unlike small farms that are just trying to get by in a very large very competitive market there are actually just a few large corporations that compete with each other and because of this have the ability to set prices at rates that are far higher than the market value and for other reasons simply do not meet these subsidies.
These are very large corporations that can afford to take losses and can afford to lose these subsidies because even if they do lose these subsidies they'll simply shed some of their overweight size and be able to continue to move on and yes well while this means that some people are likely to lose their jobs at the cost of these subsidies, recognize that the vast majority of the subsidy money doesn't go to lowering agricultural prices or doesn't go to the small farmers themselves it just goes into the pockets of big agra.
Given this is a case we don't think that it's fair to use to use public funds in order to support these big businesses.
These big businesses are largely able to stand up on their own and because of this, we think it's just wrong to ensure that they survive.
We also think that allowing these big businesses to be held up on their own to be held afloat by the government staggers innovation in other fields things like vertical farming and other methods of of GMO crop production and other types of farming gets shut out when these large business are able to keep control of the market because they're subsidized to such an extent that they're always going to be profitable and they're always going to be able to beat out other competitors.
So given that this is the case, the final thing we want to talk about is just market is just about comparative loss.
Recognize that subsidies are spending are an expenditure of public funds which means that if you're going to subsidize the agriculture business that's money that you couldn't be putting into other public goods such as education, infrastructure development, or subsidies and other areas where for example there is innovation going on like the green technology area.
Given that this is the case we would say that we shouldn't subsidize agricultural businesses and big agro at the cost of these myriad of other things that we could be doing, things that serve a very clear public good and we can just get the same type goods at a cheaper price from other areas.
We would say that investing in things like education and things like clean technology have much more abundant public goods attached to them and therefore it's a more fair use of the goods of the money that we get that the government collects through taxation that is essentially taken from the public.
If it's being taken from the public it should be used to benefit the public and we simply don't think that upholding large agricultural businesses, multibillion dollar corporations with subsidies is where this money should go to and for this reason we should not subsidize agriculture."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should limit asylum.
What we mean by this is that we would make the requirements for asylum more similar to that for regular immigration, IE, not only are you proving that you are facing an imminent threat from your government or for your life, but you also have to show that you have no criminal record, and we would have prioritization for those who will contribute to society, like the same standards that we have now, but we would be fast tracking people who also are facing death from their society.
Two main areas of clash: first, on fairness because, in the end, most immigrants are coming to the US because their home country is inhospitable.
Nobody leaves a pleasant situation where they are making enough money to feed their family and where there aren't better opportunities abroad.
Like, the majority of immigrants are coming in because they're facing intense hardship, and we think that when governments draw the line between what deserves asylum and what doesn't, they often don't consider the nuances of people's situations.
In the end, there's very little difference between leaving a war-torn country, where there's political oppression, and leaving an area, say, in mexico, where it is torn up by gangs, there's a lot of drug violence, and it's very difficult for you to have any upward leverage, because you happen to be born into a lower class, and there's like a shortage of of jobs.
The only difference, in fact, is the western perception of the situation in which they get to say, "" well, because you are politically oppressed, you somehow especially deserve asylum. ""
But given that there is equal desperation, we probably should give them an equal opportunity to enter the country.
It's unclear why one should get a fast track while the other waits for years and years, especially if the first one has a criminal record.
We think that when you force them to meet the same standards, you're creating a world in which you're going to be more fair to both parties, and you're also opening the door for more immigrants to be let in and not just asylum seekers, because these are oftentimes very similar quotas and like, especially politically, very similar in terms of how many conservative politicians are willing to allocate to both.
So we think you actually leave space for more immigrants to come in on our side of the house.
Our second area of clash is about protecting society, because when the government takes away people's individual rights such as limits the right to movement, like limits the right to speech to a point, they do so with the promise that in exchange for these rights, we're going to make sure that you are safe and protected.
And as such, the the government first owes safety to its citizens before it talks about people who are outside of that system, simply because it is the citizens who are doing things like paying taxes or giving up their individual rights, and so there's more of an expectation for the government to provide for them first.
And so we think that you violate that promise when you let in convicted criminals who could be potentially dangerous to that society.
You're breaking the trust between the citizens and the government, and we think that it's really problematic to do so, because then you are taking away people's rights in an unjust manner, given that you're not fulfilling your side of the contract.
So I think our side of the house better fulfills that nonverbal social contract between the government and the individuals.
We also think that these kinds of policies protect other immigrants, because the common individual doesn't know the difference between an immigrant who came here through normal regular immigration means versus those who came on based in asylum.
So if an asylum seeker has a bad record or behaves inappropriately once they're in the country, it looks bad for all immigrants, and oftentimes leads to the harsher legislation governing all immigrant activities, not just asylum seekers.
So we think politically there's very, very little difference between immigrants and asylum seekers and as such, we ought be holding them to the same standard, given that immigrants are already often criticized more than any other member of society.
And when you add to that criticism by being a like criminal asylum seeker, we think that you're directly harming those individuals.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban ban free newspapers.
The model for this is that we would essentially have a law that you cannot put out free newspapers into like public spaces and that in order to be able to spread your newspaper to the public you must have it in some sort of enclosed box with a lock on it that requires people to pay a sum of money, can be as low as a few pennies or twenty five cents, in order to remove that newspaper from that container.
Three main areas of clash.
The first on pollution, because I think at the point that we have widespread internet access and you have the ability of people to access news in ways far beyond print media that is often more affordable even than free newspapers at the point that they can literally be done on your phone or on your home computer or at the office rather than having to go and walk to these areas to grab these newspapers, we think that pollution becomes a very very big deal.
Because why should you continue to do something that is unnecessary if by not doing it you can save the environment at the same time?
Recognize that when something is free, people are very likely to mindlessly take that material and leave and then are much less likely to care about the material that they leave behind.
This is simple because when you're when someone does not value something and they're willing to just take it mindlessly because they might read it on the train because they do not have a price on it and they do not value it personally it is much easier for them to leave it behind because they will not miss it when it is gone.
What this means is that you get literally hundreds and thousands of these free newspapers littering the cities that distribute them.
This is incredibly problematic because oftentimes they're made with ink that is not very environmentally friendly.
These large clumps end up at our water and end up like within all like all over the ground which is aesthetically displeasing.
Moreover when you have unlocked containers that do not require money to retrieve a newspaper whenever they get knocked over or whenever they are left open when there is rain outside you end up with large spills of these like of these newspapers all over that area.
Our second area of clash has to do with why we want to promote the inclusion of real material.
Now that it costs something to like own this newspaper, less people are going to automatically take it from the bin.
This changes the incentive structure of the people who are producing it.
If you actually have to make people want to read it, you are much more likely to put real material besides advertisements within its pages because otherwise you are not going to be profitable and you're never going to get an audience.
Because we think this is actually a good change in incentive structure because we prefer a world in which you have more quality material even if you have less material overall.
We believe in quantity rather than quality.
There can be a million useless newspapers that no one reads and we prefer the world in which you get three or four where people can actually rely on the information within them and prefer to read it when they pick it up.
Our third area of clash has to do with why free newspapers contribute to the death print media.
First is the general perception.
When you see old newspapers rolling around on the ground looking gross when you see these newspapers left on subways and you see people discard them so easily you get the perception that society does not value these newspapers and thus you yourself do not value them.
This translates into other print media because at the point that it is easy for you to access this information online, it's unclear why you should be involving yourself in a form of media that everyone else seems to reject.
More than this though we also think that people get desensitized to these kinds of things.
Like at the point that you pick up so many newspapers and none of them are relevant to you, there comes a time when you just stop picking them up entirely.
This ruins it for those who actually love and read newspapers such as large portions of the elderly or even those who are younger and are rediscovering print media.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should adopt more open software and we should adopt it a whole lot more widely for the biggest reason that it's a lot fairer in terms of price and it's also going to be a lot better in terms of quality and enjoyment out of the technology in question.
So let's talk about those things.
Why is open source a lot more fair in terms of price?
And I think the biggest reason for this is because of the like way in which intellectual property law works in the status quo.
If you develop your own software, some kind of coding, a code or something like that, you basically have a monopoly over it.
You can if you develop some kind of software you can chart pretty much whatever you want for it with like as long as people are going to buy it, because that's just the way it is.
You have a monopoly over it, you could charge whatever you want.
So if it's something incredibly important, so let's say like you're you're selling like an operating system for a computer, and you're microsoft maybe, you can charge a good deal of money for something because it's something that like is incredibly important.
Or maybe it's something that's like even more niche and something that's even more or something it's even more innovative that has even more of a market capture by like single single individual companies or products.
So that means they can basically charge whatever they want.
So when you're talking about open source, when you're talking about a large degree of collaborators, when something is basically released to the public, obviously the price is going to be a lot fairer.
It's probably not going to cost all that much money if it costs anything at all or it's going to cost a rather small amount of money, basically to compensate the developers who do a whole lot of good and give like a whole lot of their time to actually develop these things.
So open software is almost universally cheaper.
And that's important because technology should be accessible.
Technology makes people's lives easier, it makes people's lives better, it's incredibly important and like we live in a modern digital age where technology is incredibly important and we should make sure that people have access to technology, and that technology is affordable.
People shouldn't have to like like mortgage like huge amounts of money just to get access to some kind of technology.
But beyond concepts of fairness and like more reasonable pricing, I also think that like you just get better products from open sourcing.
And the first of these things just, quite obviously, when you have more people working on it you can get a better product.
Oftentimes you're still going to get high quality developers, when you release something on the internet there's always going to be people that are willing to work on something, that are willing to dedicate like time that they may have to making something that's.
Good that's why open source software programs exist.
That's why microsoft isn't the only operating system and that there are alternatives that are open source.
This is like examples of that are clear.
So that's important because oftentimes these things can work incredibly well too and the more that they're supported and the more common that they are means that they're only going to become higher quality, which is great.
But I also think that oftentimes it's a lot more enjoyable on consumer end to have open source software.
Because you're able to make it a lot more like customizable and like more like individually designed towards whatever your preferences may be in a lot of cases.
So like let's say that like I'm like an average person who wants to play video games, and like I like video games.
An important thing is that like sometimes like the coding of the like the basic coding of a video game is released to the public and is like very easily editable and other times it isn't.
And this makes a big difference because if I can were because if I can like and you don't even need to necessarily have like a particularly extensive background in coding to be able to understand what these things are and to benefit from them, because you can just like say like somebody releases a mod for a video game, so like maybe a game of thrones mod for like crusader kings two or something like that, and that could be like a basic way in which you get like a new degree of enjoyment out of out of a product that exists.
Because allowing individual developers, individual designers who essentially add their own flare and customization to things.
And this is possible because the software is released to the and and it's like open and you can like make your own edits and alterations and modifications.
And then like people can decide what they like and they can essentially like more like thoroughly like customize platforms and things like that, or games and all kinds of stuff, towards our own individual preferences which is pretty cool.
So for all those reasons, we should adopt open source."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban lotteries.
We think that generally the city is justified in banning something, if you can show massive external harms.
So, we can win this round in two ways: first, by showing you that there are harms to the individual that justify state paternalizing the individual, insofar as they cannot contextualize, or understand, or consent to these harms, or by showing you that it is bad enough for society, that is in the state's best interest to ban this, in order to preserve the function of the state.
Finally enough, these are my two areas of clash: first, let's talk about why it's bad for the person.
We think it's really important to note, that the chemical pathways, that gambling activates, are identical to those activated by smoking cigarettes, taking any kind of drugs, or performing any other addictive behavior.
The cycles of addiction that are started by gambling are ones that ruin families, and actively propagate themselves in the future, and require rehabilitation.
We think that the problem currently is that we don't internalize it the same way, because it takes a different form.
Rather than shooting up, I go to the casino, but the impacts are the same.
And, we think that, if we're banning meth, because it is addictive and harmful, then we ought be doing the same to lotteries.
Second though, we think that lotteries essentially survive by lying to the consumer.
In so far as we can sue for false advertising, and like false advertising is is generally banned, we think lotteries are doing the same thing.
We think that they function by encouraging everyone, and telling everyone that anyone can be a winner, when in reality this just isn't the case, because only one out of a billion people is likely to win the lottery.
And recognize, that these people are still screwed over, because the tax on their winnings are so high, that they don' often don't go home carrying millions, but often walk away with only a few thousand.
We think that insofar these are problematic norms associated, that cause damage to the individual but keep them cycling back to the same thing, and harming their family, both emotionally, by manipulating them, but also physically, by taking money that could be spent on them, we think it ought be banned.
Our second area of clash has to do with why it's bad for society, because we think that much the way that cigarettes and drug dealers target low income, oftentimes non white, like small pockets of society, we think that casinos do the same thing.
They purposefully advertise to those who are worst off, because these are the people who are going to be lulled in, by the sense of: maybe I can make it big, maybe I can finally dig my family out of poverty.
We think, insofar as this is true, we ought not be allowing them to do this, because these are the people who also fall prey to it when they can't afford to.
We think it's probably fine, if someone who is working a job that gets them maybe a hundred thousand per year on a salary, if they go and spend some of that on the lottery tickets.
But, when you're earning less than less than twenty thousand per year, you just cannot afford to spend this on lottery tickets.
And we think, the fact this is actively encouraged and allowed to propagate is harmful to these classes of society.
But more than this, we think it redistributes this money up the ladder.
It's bad enough that they're taking advantage of the poor in the first place, the fact that this money then gets cycled back up to casino owners, and the state, and people who are actively richer than these people, we think is really problematic.
Finally though, we want to talk about why billions of dollars, that are going into gambling, would be preferable if they went into society.
We think the spending power that gets siphoned into casinos never sees the like the general market again, because the people who own large casinos often don't live in that same state, and often spend this money in larger sears, on international corporate products.
We think we would prefer a world, in which billions and billions of dollars were used as consumer spending power, within smaller communities, in support of the economy, rather than didn't.
And we think this is actively damaging to the state, when billions of dollars drain through casinos.
Finally though, we think we need to note, that this often bleeds into prostitution, drugs, and other and human trafficking, and other illegal behaviors.
We think the associated norms with gambling are strong enough to ban it in the first place, at the point that it causes people to drugs, like functions as something that buys into human trafficking and prostitution.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"International volunteering brings more harm than good for a few reasons: because it's bad for local economies where you're going to volunteer, because it's bad for relations between those people as well, and because it ultimately reinforces bad stereotypes about the people that you're trying to help.
So how does it do all these things?
First we'll talk about the economy.
It's quite obvious that one of the biggest reasons why you see a lot of a lot of like some countries in poverty besides things like imperialism, which we'll get to later, is because they don't have sufficiently developed economies that are able to support their populations where people are able to work a good day's living and make enough money to support themselves and their families.
So the best way in order to ensure development is to make it so that there are jobs that people can work and that's how you actually make a self sustaining economy.
So you don't need constant intervention and you don't need to keep volunteering.
People can support themselves.
So how do you ensure this?
So it's quite obvious that if you give someone a free service, they're obviously going to take that service.
So if you offered to build someone a house for free, obviously they're going to build that house for free.
Here's the problem, what this does.
This takes away on two different levels.
First it takes away from the private sector and the ability of people in the local economy to develop.
So what does this look like?
If you're going to be building a house for somebody for free, suddenly the people who may be supplying those raw goods they aren't going to be able to make money off of that, all the people who would otherwise be getting paid for their labor are unable to sell their labor and make money that way, so those are the first ways in which you're going to get rid of possible economic growth.
The second way in which this happens is it takes away from government sponsoring of these kinds of services.
So even if like so like international volunteering is unique because it's entirely devoid of possible goods and services, things like.
Even if you need to give someone who's homeless house for free, which obviously you should do this, if someone can afford to pay for this kind of construction.
It's it's substitutable by things like the government paying for the services or paying other people provide these services.
But when people go in directly and do these kinds of things for free, which is inherent to international volunteering, that uniquely leads to an economy not able develop.
So this has much wider ramifications than just simply being limited to something like housing, because this is obviously housing, it's quite major.
But this can also do things like english teachers.
This people who have like that kind of skill are going to find it more difficult to find a job.
You can talk about like maybe even like manufacturing medicine to fight malaria.
People who would manufacture those things are now also going to be out of a job.
All of the many areas in which we have volunteering, this is a ubiquitous problem with that specifically.
But next thing I want to talk about is about the relations and stereotypes this propagates.
I think that this has a couple of bad things.
First and foremost, it doesn't lead to the actual creation of bonds in a very positive way.
And the reason that it doesn't do that is because oftentimes people who go there aren't going to be there permanently.
Most people who go to volunteer are only going to do it for a couple of years maybe after college.
So the problem that this has is that the connections that you make with locals are oftentimes only going to be ephemeral and are not going to be all that long lasting.
So this means that you're not actually really genuinely helping a lot of people as far as being a constant guiding force.
So for example, if you're replacing an english teacher that is native to the country, then you're going to be replacing it with someone who's not going to be there after a couple of years.
So this means that ultimately that person is going to be losing that possible guiding force for more years down the line.
But I also additionally think that it's possible that they won't do as good of a job because they're not going to have as much of an in depth understanding of that culture and as much of an in depth understanding of what the actual needs of the community are.
And this goes into the final thing which is about how it propagates bad stereotypes.
About how it propagates stereotypes that people in developing countries like developing parts of the world like africa and countries in africa or southeast asia or other areas need to be held, need to be saved because they're desperate for services and help from the west.
And it's I think it's important to combat these stereotype because it leads to bad policy down the line.
So for all those reasons very proud to propose."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should abolish intellectual property rights.
Two independent points, the first is that intellectual property rights stifle innovation.
The way in which this works is that if somebody comes up with an idea, something that can be either patented or copyrighted, that idea is then essentially off limits for some period of time to anyone else within that market.
This can be something as innocuous as a song or as, you know, really fundamental as , you know, an idea for a type of medicine or a idea for a way to develop a certain type of software.
What this means is that if you put an idea or just a category of inventions off limits to the market, development within that type of technology or that type of , you know, product or whatever the item is stops, with the exception of one firm working on it.
Generally, this isn't the way we want markets to work.
We want everyone to basically play off of this idea, something broad like a like a cell phone or even the ideas of apps or something like that, and develop it to its best version possible, so the consumers are receiving the best product possible.
When an idea is off limits though to large portions of the market, that means that the firms that usually drive innovation can't participate, and the one firm that has a monopoly on it usually doesn't have much of an incentive to push the idea further.
Furthermore, though, this opens up the door for patent trolls, that is, people who will essentially eat up ideas and patent them and then go after smaller firms that try to build on the idea with onerous amounts of lawsuits.
We think that when you open up this legal mechanism for stifling competition in the market, the standard issues associated with monopolies often then manifest.
We don't think that there's a need to protect these for cost recouping like you have with traditional physical patents.
This is often cited in the medical industry as a reason to protect patents, because the drug manufacturers have a lot of upfront costs that they need to make back and they can't afford people selling generic versions of their product , you know, eating up the sales.
But we don't think that this is an issue with ideas, generally because there's not a lot of costs associated with coming up with an idea.
Our second independent point is that there really isn't a strong principled claim to what we're looking at here.
So I think the first reason why this is true is that often ideas are derivative of other ideas.
If we're looking at the music industry, for example, often what the next big thing is is either just simply a rearticulation of something someone else did.
For example, elvis was considered groundbreaking for something that chuck berry had already been doing for years.
But even if it is truly new to the greatest extent we generally see, it's a slight variation on something that an earlier artist had done in a way that, sure, will move the industry forward but doesn't, by and large, constitute a huge amount of meaningfully new material and new innovations.
So we think that because these products are often derivative in nature, it's unreasonable to give an exclusive right to development on that idea to one individual.
But secondly, it's often arbitrary who's successful.
Multiple people come up with ideas similar to one another all the time.
And we think that often the determining factor in who gets to actually, you know, snatch up the copyright, and who gets to actually move forward with that idea is essentially rooted in how much money the individual has, how quick they can get to the patent office and afford the patent.
I think there's countless stories out there of inventors who didn't get credit for something that they actually came up with originally, because some richer, more powerful individual was able to snatch up the patent first.
We think that creating this legal structure, then, exacerbates existing inequalities in our society that favor the already powerful.
And thirdly is that often similarity is arbitrary.
Again, going back to music, we think that certain like beats and melodic patterns are often replicated throughout song after song after song.
So the thing that you are copyrighting, fundamentally, is often something that isn't even particularly unique.
And at that point, we don't think that there's much of a principle to claim to your right to have a monopoly over that idea.
Proud to propose."
"We should absolutely prohibit corporal punishment, also more colloquially known as child abuse, and I think that the reason for that is two reasons for that are rather clear.
First, because it doesn't actually work, and second, because it's incredibly cruel and incredibly heartless thing to do, and as a moral society we should ban it.
So let's start by talking about why corporal punishment is grossly ineffective and doesn't actually work.
So, obviously like there is two general groups.
Like corporal punishment could be used as like discipline for like prisoners or things like that, or it can be used for like children as a form of discipline.
I think in either instance it's grossly ineffective.
As far as like prisoners are concerned and things like that, I think a lot of the same arguments with torture apply, in that people are more likely to be rebellious or resentful and things like that, so you're more likely to, if you like physically abuse prisoners, you're more likely going to see prisoners either be violent themselves, because the violence becomes more normalized within the cell walls because prison guards are doing it, or it's also going to become much more of a resentment, that you're going to see much more of a desire to do harm to other people, much more of a desire to do harm, because revenge and hate, especially when somebody physically abuses you, are rather powerful and rather difficult to get rid of.
I think that as far as it applies to kids, it's even more ineffective, and the reason for this is like pretty straightforward.
Most societies don't let you go too far with corporal punishment as is, if you're truly like truly injuring your kid, that's just child abuse, you could be put in prison for that.
So there's already a line that's being drawn, and it's already difficult to like meeting the try to like use corporal punishment as a tool.
But I also think that all it does is it makes kids better at lying, because if for example you spank a kid because they like talk back to you, or you spank a kid because they don't do their homework or whatever it is that they do, all they're probably going to do the next time is they're going to become more resentful, they're not going to trust you, they're not going to be open and honest with you as a parent, they're going to look at you more as an authority figure rather than somebody that they can confide to, rather than somebody that they can open up to, because, you know, you probably don't talk about your feelings or your life or things like that with people who physically attack you.
So you're probably not actually going to create a very healthy relationship between between parents and children either, and there's no real reason for that to exist.
So, why is it cruel and unusual, why is it grossly why is it just like a gross thing that we should not allow at all.
And I think that like I already said, most societies already don't allow child abuse and things like that, and if they don't they certainly should, and the reason for that is because kids are incredibly vulnerable.
Kids don't have the means of like supporting themselves and defending themselves, but kids are still people.
Kids bleed like everyone else, their bones break, and they feel pain like everybody else.
And the idea that like kids belong to their parents, or prisoners just belong to the state, and that you can do whatever you want with them and just physically abuse them, make them suffer, is just absolutely heinous, it's primitive in the sense that you try to cause physical pain to others to make them do what you want them to do, as if you have some kind of ownership over their body to the point where you can just where where you can just make them suffer for your own betterment.
I think that that's completely degrading to their own agency, to their own human lives and the own value that they have.
And that's why I think that like the physical abuse, the physical nature of corporal punishment, makes it grossly unacceptable in a modern society, and why we obviously need to ban it.
So for all of those reasons, very proud to propose."
"The motion for today's round is we should increase gun control.
By we meaning the united states government and by increasing gun control we refer to things like increasing licensing and background checks for gun owners, regulating the types of guns so maybe you can buy a hunting rifle to go hunting with, but you can't buy a semiautomatic pistol because this is designed to kill people, or decreasing open carry laws so that people cannot carry their guns outside.
So two main areas of clash, the first on government obligations and why guns are uniquely dangerous.
We tell you that governments are meant to protect the citizens and this is their first and foremost necessary obligation.
Why is this the case?
Because recognize that the only reason that we particularly want governments is to protect our rights.
Recognize that if I thought that I could live a fully autonomous life without government intervention, I would probably do so.
But I recognize that me living in the wild probably means that being weaker and smaller than a lot of other people, my will and rights will be subverted to others.
This is why people aggregate into communities that create governments in order to protect all of their rights and not allow arbitrary characteristics to create the hierarchy of who gets to dominate who.
What this means is that when we recognize that the primary obligation of the government is to protect their citizens, we recognize that if guns pose a large threat to the safety of rights of citizens then the government must regulate them.
So everyone agrees that guns used against innocents and used to inspire violence is bad and the only justified reason for guns the majority of the time is one for self defense.
But recognize that this is already provided by the government the majority of the time.
Having things like police that walk the streets and are able to be called to your house if you need them, being able to have a military that is well funded, all of these things mean that your need to protect yourself is minimum in the majority of western liberal democracies.
And especially the united states.
We tell you that under an effective government, you don't need pistols or other semi automatic guns.
But more than this, we tell you that the obligation of the government to protect your citizen's rights supersedes that one person's right to maybe own a gun.
Recognize this is easily proven through recognizing that there is a rights hierarchy.
What we mean by this is that certain rights are more important than others.
Such as the right to life superseding, say, our property rights to to hold a gun.
A perfect example of us recognizing this is when we tax when government taxes maybe tax the rich more unfairly than those who are poorer because we recognize that your right to property is less than someone else's right to social services or medical health care that allow them to continue living their lives.
We tell you that gun rights are similar.
I probably don't care about your right to own a gun, as long as there is a sizable decrease in violence and a sizable decrease in the number of deaths.
Secondary of clash has to do with violence and its decrease.
Because everyone has heard that quote, guns don't kill people.
People kill people.
But recognize that people kill people a hell of a lot easier when they have access to guns.
We tell you that it's easier to get into conflicts in the heat of the moment when things like open carry laws exist and a simple argument can turn much more violent when someone pulls a gun.
We think that on our side of the house, it makes it first, less likely that individual violent outbursts occur.
We think that a lot of people are just irrational and things like bar fights open up are much harder to have a more violent outcome and more lives lost when you're stabbing someone with a knife rather than a gun can literally end someone's life with one shot.
But more than this, we think that it makes it easier to track and use weapon use on an individual level it's just much harder for random people to target to get a hold of guns in the first place when you do things like background checks that criminals can't buy them.
When you do things like make sure that these people don't have certain mental health illnesses that lead things to like that lead to things like columbine or two teenagers on lots of meds can get a hold of a couple of guns and shoot up a school.
But more than this we think a lot of people are like oh but the black market will exist.
The problem with this is that black markets oftentimes make things more expensive and harder to reach.
What this means is that no matter what on our side of the house it will be harder to get guns.
But even if a black market exists, we think it is infinitely easier to track on our side of the house when there's less noise around this black market of it being legal or illegal.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should subsidize wikipedia.
What we mean by we is that it would be the united states and would probably do like a couple thousand dollars like every half a year or so like just a little bit of extra money to keep it going.
Two main areas of clash, first on why this is a low risk but incredibly high reward investment on the part of the government.
Recognize that subsidies are only bad in two situations: first when they distort the market or second when they lead to capture and like perverse incentives come into play.
This can't happen because wikipedia's for you so there's no distortionary power in subsidizing them because it's not like you're encouraging individuals to use a specific service rather you're just allowing a service that individuals were already using to continue existing but second by nature it can't be captured because it is edited by the general population so even if like now they hired dramatically higher numbers of mods given as those mods aren't allowed to add information and only edit it this first signals to individuals that there might be shady things on there and there will be a backlash but second it's just unlikely that it will accomplish anything.
Meanwhile wikipedia is one of the leading providers of free information.
It's really helpful in maintaining an educated populace because it creates a consistent no paywall avenue for people who can't afford other service other sources.
This is especially needed now since wikipedia is constantly in danger of running out of funding like we've all seen those little things when we log on that say if everyone donated three dollars we'd be able to run ourselves for years and years and years the problem is that individuals often don't donate this is a collective action problem that says like maybe someone else will but also a lot of the populations at services simply don't have the funds to donate like a lot of people who use it are college students or high school students or like people who don't have access to other forms of information that maybe would be preferable because they'd be paid.
So we think that this is like actually one of the most like best ways to to like make sure it is something that can survive and service people for a long time especially since as like the consumer base grows and as there's more information available it becomes more and more expensive to run.
Recognize also that we're living in a world where information is harder and harder to come across for free like wikipedia is usually well sourced and easy to navigate people can tell what they can trust and they can't because it has a list of all the references at the bottom and this is vastly better than what we currently have with fake news that we just can't check ourselves a lot of the time.
Our second area of clash is about fulfilling government duties because recognize that any government in in a democracy has a responsibility to uphold that democracy like and it must do so for like its own propagation.
But that can only occur with an informed populace because that's the only time that people can figure out their preferences and broadcast that via votes.
If I don't know the current events or political players I have no way of drawing actual conclusions on the subs on the subject and using my political voice.
Subsidizing free information sources is a really easy way of doing this because it provides the public with the necessary tools to inform themselves.
It would also be the cheapest thing for the US government because recognize like at most this would be a couple thousand dollars like every six months like it really wouldn't be a lot of money compared to the majority of other things because we're just using this to upkeep a free service so you're like paying a minimal amount to the people who like music you like have to pay for the for the bandwith like for the for the server itself like wikipedia is used to running on pennies this isn't something that we think that the government has to worry about it all but the other alternatives would always be way more costly.
Recognize that if the government is trying to subsidize some kind of free information other than wikipedia there would have to turn to like individual news organization like the new york times which gets a lot more costly because investigative journalism is always more expensive but also because they wouldn't be able to show preference for one news company and so would have to subsidize many of them.
Proud to propose."
"We should subsidize adoption.
What we mean by this is that united states government should pour money into lowering the cost that it takes to adopt a child.
Three main areas of clash: first, on why it's shifting the current culture.
Because recognize that there are a lot of children that need families and that that population growth is becoming a very real issue in terms of the way that it impacts our planet and our standard of living.
What this means is that we don't think that people should be having as many kids as they are having in the status quo.
We're not even sure if they should be having any kids if they're people who come from relatively privileged backgrounds and have the means to support a child from another household.
We think that you need to encourage people to adopt instead, which is exactly what our proposal is.
Recognize that government signaling is a big deal, even when if there isn't a direct legislation act or a direct ban.
First and foremost, this is because the government is generally a role model.
It is made up of people who have lots of experience, who tell you that they are there to run the country, and who tell you to trust them to do so.
This necessarily holds a lot of weight when it comes to the general population that is being told to commit to these things, that elected these officials into office, that are told to follow the laws that they set.
But also, recognize that it molds public behavior more directly when it comes through policy.
Like if the government suddenly says, "" hey, look, we're going to use public action to actually fund these things, "" rather than just say that they are good, we think that impacts the way that the general public acts.
We saw this when it came to desegregation in the united states.
Sure, there were still a lot of racist people, but they were infinitely less likely to show that they were racist publicly.
We also saw this with hate speech laws in european countries where the existence of the law promoted a general cultural shift to being more accepted so that it became actively problematic if someone said something hateful, even if it's not because they were arrested but rather because general society had developed a distaste for that rhetoric.
Look.
This is something that might be slow, but it's going to happen.
You have to change the idea that adoption is only for the rich and only something that is done if you are someone who can't have kids on your own.
Show that it is something that is no longer having a cost barrier to anyone below the upper middle class and show that it is something that we encourage and see as good, even if you are capable of having your own kids biologically.
We think starting those actions is good.
Our second area of clash is about why it's good for the orphanage system.
Recognize, first and foremost, that currently orphanages in the public system are incredibly overburdened, and this isn't necessarily due to a lack of accommodations or a lot of funding.
It's more due to the fact that there's a set number of orphanages but a number of children that grows as the population grows and as the number of teen pregnancies rise.
So, we think this isn't actually something that can be solved on their side of the house, but what you can do is unburden the physical infrastructure.
Take children out of that building that is going to stay the same on both sides of the house, get more kids into home so that they can live better lives than they are in the status quo, which we think is an independent voter issue regardless.
Look.
We think that kids in the status quo who stay in orphanages get very bad treatment.
Like, we see this in terms of the fact that they're infinitely more likely to become to have like the school-to-prison pipeline, they're more likely to be abused, they're more likely to have bad experiences with attachment, and we think that all of that is solvable when you encourage adoption.
Our third area of clash is about justice.
Look.
We think that insofar as everybody has the biological ability to have children unless there's something that has gone physically wrong, that having children is a human right.
It is problematic, by symmetry, that because I was born with like a non-functional uterus, I should be deprived of something that other people around me, regardless of their other characteristics, are able to enjoy, just because of that physical abnormality.
The problem in the status quo is that even if I am someone who desperately wants children but I don't have the money to adopt, I still can't.
We think the government has an obligation to level that playing field.
Subsidize adoption, let people have kids.
Proud to propose."
"We should fight urbanization.
In the status quo, urbanization is becoming increasingly popular, increasingly rapid in the developed world and especially in the developing world.
The world blank the world bank and the united nations project that more and more people are going to move into urban areas, but we think that with this urbanization comes immense problems that ultimately outweigh any sort of benefits that come from more people being an urban area.
So we're just going to lay those out and explain why we think urbanization is more problematic than good.
Alright, firstly, we would say that urbanization creates clusters of prosperity while deluding opportunities for everyone else.
What we mean by this is when you have highly urbanized area these are areas in which businesses are much more likely to spring up and which existing businesses are much more likely to move their labor centers and to move their business centers and this is because it's much easier to get labor in these areas, it's because there's just a huge amount of people and you're more likely to get skilled laborers as well as just masses of people that are in need of work.
What this means is that in urban areas themselves, it drives down wages because there's an increased amount of people that could potentially fill any given job and it means that outside of these urban areas, there are fewer jobs available to those that are incapable of moving or do not simply do not want to move into urban areas which we think is legitimate choice that those people should be able to make.
So we think you both decrease the prosperity of those in and outside of urban areas.
Additionally, we think that these urban areas are just a horrible ar-ar are horrible for human health and we think this is for a few reasons.
Firstly, urbanization has led to immense amounts of smog especially in the developing world which has long term health implications for the people for the citizens of these urban areas.
For example, you can look at major industrial cities in china and see how people literally cannot walk outside without putting on a mask to protect themselves from breathing in this harmful smog.
It also is the case that when you have so many people packed packed so densely into an urban area it makes it much more likely that communicable diseases will be transmitted throughout the population in this is a way in which contaminations and outbreaks can occur and we think with increased rates of urbanization, you're much more likely to get increase rates of potentially fatal outbreaks in these areas that could spread very rapidly, not just within the country, but globally and we think that in a comparison, if you had a lesser urbanized world there are fewer people that are likely to come into contact with these diseases and we think that that is preferable especially given the high rates of the high rates of disease in these areas.
Regardless of the communicable nature of these diseases.
We also say that that when you have high rates of urbanization there are massive increases in housing costs, and what we think the sense of resulting in is that people that people and communities that have existed in these urban areas end up being priced out of their own neighborhoods and this is how gentrification works and is particularly prominent in areas such as urban new york, in places like brooklyn areas in which prior to the last decade these were largely poor areas which rents were relatively low but now that people are moving into these areas in mass, housing costs are obviously going way up because of a lack of infrastructure to house these people and communities become dismantled and destroyed by these rates of urbanization.
So even if there are increased even if there is increased job opportunities in these areas in the long run, the people that have been in these areas that have been located in these areas get priced out to the point where they can't partake in this prosperity which means that with already high rates of income inequality, those that are the worst off those that are the worst off especially in these urban areas end up becoming even more worse off in the long run.
We think that urbanization leads to increased rates of health risks, increased rates of pollution, lower prosperity in general, and particularly harms or particularly bad and problematic harms for those that are the most vulnerable and the worst off in urban areas already.
And for these reasons, we should fight urbanization."
"We should legalize polygamy because people should have the right to marry whomever and however many people they want and beyond that there's a lot of genuinely good reasons people may have for wanting to marry multiple individuals.
So let's start by talking about why this is simply something that people should have the right to.
And I think that this starts with the fact that marriage is only important in a cultural sense and as like a way of like signaling legitimacy of a union basically.
Like the only difference between gay marriage between a same between a same sex couple and a civil union is basically the signal that it provides.
The way in which these people are looked upon.
And I think that that's important because I think that regardless of whom you want to be with or how many people you want to be with I think that you should exist in a society that's free of public scorn, free of public scrutiny, and a society that is generally accepting of your life choices, especially when we're talking about something so personal as the people that you love.
And I think that this is kind of ridiculous because you have like open relationships where people can be in a relationship with multiple individuals, hooking up with multiple individuals, and that's something that is rather accepted now and it's something that a lot of people don't really bat an eye at.
Some people may not agree with it but you certainly wouldn't do anything nor could you do anything to literally ban somebody from dating multiple people at the same time.
So it's kind of ridiculous that you can have relationships with with multiple individuals at the same time but you just can't get this official designation as marrying these people.
And I think that's ridiculous because in the same way in which like if you have a relationship with one person and you happen to like them enough and you want to start a life with them and you want to marry them, I don't really see why the mere fact that there is multiple people means that it's any less worthy of a state sanctioning or a cultural acceptance that comes with marriage.
But beyond that I think that there's a lot of genuinely good reasons that people have for wanting to get married to multiple people in the first place.
And obviously a big one is religious reasons.
A lot of religions have a whole lot of polygamy like judaism, islam, mormonism, like there's been a whole lot of instances throughout religious history where individuals have been married to multiple people.
And if that's something that they think is like it that's something that is acceptable within their religion that means that it's acceptable within their value system.
And I think it's important to make sure that you're trying to be as accommodating as possible, especially because it's not like there's any real harm to polygamy like if people are getting married to two people I don't really see how it actually hurts anybody, how it actually affects anybody, it doesn't really do anything at all.
They're just married to multiple people now.
It doesn't affect anyone.
I don't really see why the government should have any say over that whatsoever.
So obviously if there is a religious reason that does exist, that should clearly be overriding because there's no real reason that you should have to regulate that.
It doesn't hurt anyone, it's ridiculous to try to like regulate private norms in such a way.
And also additionally it's completely legitimate that people may want to marry multiple individuals.
Like, for example, maybe you're a bisexual person and you want to marry both a man and a woman because that's the best way in which you're going to like really like truly act on your preferences.
Like it's you're most likely to be happy that way maybe and you don't want to just like pick and choose between one person or another person.
And like there's a whole lot of people who feel that way.
A ton of people are bi.
Or maybe you just don't want to have like you don't want to be tied down to a single person and you're going to be like in a happier marriage if you're with multiple people, if you're able to be with multiple people with your life.
And that's probably something that could be good too, like there's a lot of divorces that happen in this around the world.
Clearly marriage is broken in a lot of ways.
People should be able to have marriages in a way in which they want to do so because marriage is nothing more than a life than like maybe a life long relationship with somebody and that should be ultimately up to you.
So for all those reasons you should allow polygamy."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban targeted killing.
We think that this would be like an international law like on a government level because a lot of these are done a lot of targeted killings are conducted by like individual groups and their leaders rather than like individual citizens.
So we would ban this on like more of a higher level.
Two main areas of clash, first on why it is unethical and undemocratic.
Recognize that every individual's life has the same value and deserves the same rights insofar as there is no difference between me and you in the way that we reason with the world, in the way that we suffer, in the way that we are sentient individuals with some kind of intelligence with like mild arbitrary differences.
The problem with assassination is that it denies the individual a chance to defend innocence or a chance for a fair punishment if they are guilty which is one of those fundamental rights that everyone has an equal right to.
Like we think that insofar as every single person is created equal and we recognize that every single person deserves to have a fair trial, deserves to be able to say I'm not guilty in case they are guilty aren't guilty, we think that it's an unethical when certain individuals random groups get to decide well you in particular don't deserve this and we think that's bad.
This cedes the power over individual life to a tiny group or even one person with a certain political ideal.
Also recognize that it's often used to target political dissidents example the way that the israeli government would often target palestinian leaders for for death because they would like see them as threats to their government or threats to like their nation but the problem here is that there isn't actually someone to say that certain like the majority of political leanings are correct or incorrect and we especially don't think that a single entity gets to say that insofar as clearly that entity has a bias towards whatever political system they currently exist again around or whatever political idea they've already endorsed.
So we think that this is actually really bad when groups just decide that they understand justice better than the laws that are already laid out that the majority has already accepted do.
And we think that it's like bad that they deny society the right to rule on this individual and have their ideas in the marketplace like just like we think this also violates free speech to a really large extent in that it kills someone before they get out everything they've had to say and that's also really really bad.
Our second argument though is about creating instability and power vacuums.
Recognize this kind of thing is often used to target leaders of movements and once they are dead it creates a struggle for power often dominated by whoever has the most money and majoritarian fervor insofar as like we see this often times when we remove dictators we see that suddenly there's this like empty space they used to occupy and all of these groups want to occupy it so then you have oftentimes like violent interactions between maybe a military power and a rebel group and things like that.
This is bad because it prevents democratic processes from operating and also makes it a lot easier for extremists and power mongerers to take power because the citizens of that country are really scared at that moment so it's really easy for them to vote for a leader who can say look I will be strong I will protect you even if that strength comes from being oppressive or violent and so in a world where we like want to prevent extremists we prefer the like danger you know to the danger that you don't know insofar as like we have no idea how unpredictable or bad whoever takes power can be.
It also prevents any kind of future cooperation between parties once you've killed one of their leaders because the group doesn't trust you anymore and so it prolongs the original conflict because now you need a third party to come in and say look look we can all be friends I promise and oftentimes you don't even listen to them because you're not going to trust anyone who you don't believe you don't trust to use democratic processes so why would you even like engage with them in the first place if you know that she's going to kill you anyway.
This all feeds reciprocal violence like we think that a lot of the time what happens is like one group has someone killed and they're like okay we have to get them back and so they go against the other group again and this violence doesn't solve anything it just kills off more and more individuals which we think is always bad.
Proud to propose."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that physical education should be mandatory.
First, just a quick overview on how, you know, the burden structure in this round works.
Because generally speaking, when we're talking about whether or not a government should compel action by individuals, there's a couple standards that independently can be sufficient to justify that requirement.
So, what I mean by this is that obviously the opp line in this round is going to be something to the effect of, "" well, you know, you're telling these kids that they got to do a thing, and it's better when you allow them to make the choice, "" because individuals are more capable of making choices for themselves that some third-party actor.
That's obviously a high standard that we hold in pretty high regard.
So generally speaking then, we have high bars that we meet to ensure that, you know, that's not that the that the restriction is justified.
I see two, and these are going to be my two independent points.
The first is if there is more or less objective good given to the individual when you enact a restriction, so for example, restrictions that we put on cigarettes, for example, are more or less objective and this is why we are justified in doing them, also why we, you know, require academic education in beyond just physical education.
But secondly is when there's externalities.
That is, you know, also looking at cigarettes, something like secondhand smoke, something where we see that a person that didn't consent into the action is suffering consequences and as a result we are justified in restricting it because, you know, your autonomy doesn't extend to violating other people's preferences.
On the first point, then, regarding objectivity, I think there's a pretty obvious case to be made in terms of, you know, the health benefits of engaging in physical education.
Especially when children are quite young, there is a serious need to ensure that they are physically active.
This country's obesity epidemic really underlines how insufficient a job we are of doing meeting that standard but, you know, just that small amount of physical activity a day, you know, thirty minutes or whatever, that really goes a long way in ensuring the child's long-term physical well-being.
Without that physical education, there really isn't an meaningful check to ensure that they are doing that.
I think a lot of the kids that are getting their proper exercise are the type of kids that are usually fine with doing PE anyway.
These are the more competitive kids, the more active ones.
I think really what PE is designed to do is to target the kids that aren't getting a sufficient amount of exercise on a daily basis, because they're just not the type of the personality type that enjoys doing that on a regular basis.
But it is still important to ensure that they get that physical education, so the government probably is then justified in mandating it.
On the second standard then, regarding externalities, I think a lot of this folds into healthcare costs.
So, this was also flouted a lot during the sugary drinks debate around new york city.
And what happens here is that when you have a substantial amount of people that are, you know, not active enough and by extension, then, not healthy, their healthcare costs go up.
This is, you know, fairly clear why this would happen, you know, that they're more likely to have physical illnesses, they're going to be making more doctors visits, so on so forth.
Given that, the the way the healthcare works essentially is based on a pool.
That is, when one person's costs go up, in order for them to be properly covered, other people's costs also have to go up.
On an individual level, this really doesn't make that big of a difference.
On a larger societal level, when we are undergoing something like an obesity epidemic, that has a really significant impact on healthcare costs.
And, in fact, the united states now is one of the most expensive places to get healthcare in the world, and a large factor in that is just the general unhealthiness of this country.
I think that it is justified to engage in tactics there's explicitly designed to improve the healthiness of individuals within this country when there are broader externalities on other people, people that have to pay more for health care because of other people's , you know, health.
Given that, proud to propose."
"We should limit the internet of things.
Now what I mean by the internet of things is this network of devices that are not traditionally considered computers but that are still hooked up to the internet today.
So certain refrigerators, vehicles, and other items are embedded with internet connectivity that certainly would not have been ten years ago.
And we think that the proliferation of such devices and their implementation ought be limited.
Ultimately we think that these limitations might take the form of banning some types of connectivity and also of making sure that people are informed about the existence of the internet at things and give them alternative options to choose from.
So with that in mind we have three arguments: one about privacy, one about reliability, and one about the types of companies that benefit from the internet of things.
So first in terms of privacy it should not be anyone's business how often I open my refrigerator but this is exactly the kind of data that's collected by the internet of things.
Many of these appliances or other devices are designed to send data about our everyday practices back to the company that made them so that these companies can better target products at people.
Now you might say oh well that's a good thing if it leads to better products but what if it leads to things like companies saying oh well if they opened the refrigerator door on average twenty thousand times a year and if we want them to have to buy a new refrigerator every five years then we'll make it so that it conks out after a hundred thousand opens.
This kind of enforced failure of products is much more likely with the internet of things.
Ultimately it's much easier to plan for products to be able unable to function in the future when they're closely connected to the internet.
In the same way that I phone upgrades are designed to make older I phones unusable so that you have to buy a new one this is now taking place with refrigerators and even with cars with firmware updates.
So we think that people are being forced to spend a huge amount of money on products that don't serve their purpose any better, it's not like these refrigerators keep your yogurt cooler, but at the same time they're much more expensive and much less reliable in the long term.
Our second argument then is about reliability and I've already touched on this a little bit but the internet of things simply makes everything it's connected to less reliable.
Even if you set aside the malevolence that I talked about earlier with planned obsolescence, it's still true that when you make devices more complex you make them more likely to fail.
Before cars were full of electric components they lasted much longer and were much easier to repair.
You probably heard older people talk about how it used to be true that you could fix a car by yourself and it was very easy to do in your driveway whereas today it's very difficult and really takes a professional.
The internet of things is just the next step to this process of making products less reliable over time.
Ultimately, when they're no longer able to connect to their servers or when their servers go away in the first place these products are going to stop working and people will have to buy new ones so we think that this only makes products less reliable and that this is worse for consumers.
And our final argument is that ultimately certain very large companies benefit from the internet of things and are able to exclude all other companies.
The data that the internet of things gathers helps you to better sell products not to make better products but to better target them to your consumers and ensure that people choose your products.
But only extremely large companies like amazon or samsung are really able to participate.
Smaller companies are simply being left behind and aren't able to adapt so even if they have a good product to offer they aren't being given access to the data that lets them sell that product.
We think that ultimately this crowds out smaller and medium sized businesses and leads to greater and greater consolidation of industry in the hands of a few large companies like samsung and that this will ultimately make it harder to regulate these companies and will lead to worse quality of life for everyone when prices go up due to less competition.
For all of these reasons, we should limit the internet of things.
Thank you."
"We should legalize insider trading.
So, insider trading is basically treating a publicly listed company using information that is not available to the public.
So, for instance, if you were an member of a board of a company, you would have access to insider information, and if you use that to sell stocks of that company at the expense of everyone else, that would be insider trading.
We think this should be legal.
So, first of all, we think that it's going to be very difficult to ever actually prevent insider trading.
People have information that they access subconsciously, without even thinking about it.
It's quite likely that everyone who's ever been on the board of a major publicly held company has some sort of insider knowledge about that industry that isn't available to other people.
So at the point where we still that these people invest, we're allowing some level of insider trading to take place.
What we think is problematic is that, effectively, the law applies to some people and not others.
There are certain people, such as existing members of the board of a company, who aren't allowed to sell their stocks as they wish while other people, like members of the US congress, often are able to get away with this.
We think it would be preferable to carefully regulate insider trading rather than ban it overall.
In that way, we can allow everyone to have the free ability to sell their stocks, using the information that they have, which we think, generally speaking, allows people to pursue their own best interests, but we could also minimize the harms to others.
We could require, for instance, that information be made publicly available if it is used to guide investing decisions.
And in that way, you would allow people to invest as they wish while also mitigating some of the harms of insider information.
But we think, moreover, that this makes it so that the application of the law is less selective.
In other words, if we applied lots of regulations to this, we think there would be enough transparency to actually allow prosecution.
Right now, it's very difficult to prove that someone took advantage of insider trading unless they're exceptionally stupid.
But we think that by carefully regulating this, we would create an incentive for companies and investors to keep careful records to prove that they acted in accordance with the law.
A failure to keep such records might be probable cause to investigate further to see if they were acting in poor faith.
So with this in mind, we think it's clear that regulation is preferable to a ban, and therefore that we should legalize insider trading.
Our second argument is about why we think that this would be good for the economy writ large.
Realize that right now, those who know most about investing in an industry are hamstrung from investing in that industry.
We think that, for instance, if people who were part of the airline industry started investing in a given airline, very likely right now they would get in trouble for trading with insider information.
But the signalling effect that their investment has is that people shouldn't have confidence in that sector of the market.
So we think that by legalizing insider trading, you would boost confidence in the market writ large.
This would likely lead to a more bullish market and economic growth overall.
This is true because a major problem right now in american markets, in particular, is that people are saving rather than investing.
Right now, US corporations have trillions of dollars on hand, on aggregate, and aren't investing that money, which means that it's not going towards developing new companies or allowing for further development.
It's just sitting in banks.
We would prefer to see more investment, and we think that anything that increases confidence in the market is likely to achieve that investment.
We think this will probably lead to higher economic growth and that while this may only be true for the states, it's probably true for other countries as well.
Given that this is true, we think that it's very likely that by legalizing insider trading, you get a sort of rising tide that lifts all boats.
Even if some people accrue more personal wealth as a result of this insider trading, economic growth in the long run will help everybody.
So for these reasons, we should legalize insider trading.
Thank you."
"We should introduce carbon taxes.
So in this round we're not gonna -bate about the exact rate at which carbon production is going to be taxed, we're going to say though it will be a a substantial tax per unit of carbon output, per unit of CO two emission.
It will be a very high tax rate.
Okay two big arguments we want to talk about.
The first is global warming and why we think this is an effective measure to curtail global warming and the second is about why this is an effective balance of economic and environmental needs.
So on global warming, we think that global warming is the biggest threat that humanity currently faces to its survival.
It's not war, it's not super bugs, and it's not terrorism.
It's the inevitability of global warming if we continue along the path that we're on.
The outcomes are staggering.
Scientists project that in future years rising sea levels are going to destroy massive economic hubs such as miami, such as new york, such as boston.
Because and this is hugely impactful because first there's a mass migration that's going to need to occur in land and it also means that you destroy the centers of economic activity amongst even the most industrialized states.
Further, we are more likely to get more extreme weather events such as tornadoes and hurricanes and we have seen in recent months and recent years the toll that these things can have especially on those that are already the worst off.
And finally when you have global warning have these environmental changes you've less regularity in seasons which means that it makes agricultural production far more difficult and there's less clean water available for people which we think likely is going to only increase the likelihood of conflict.
We need to act now in order to make that change.
We need to care about our own survival but more importantly, about the survival of future people we are forcing to come into this world that have no responsibility for the world that they are being born into.
We think that carbon taxes are an effective measure of fighting global warming because it puts a price on the future harm that corporations and that people are creating.
It means that in the status quo, people don't need to internalize the harm and corporations don't need to internalize the harm of their emissions.
They can pass it on down the road onto those future persons.
But we reached the end of that we've reached the end of the road that we can kick the can down.
We need to start acting now if we're going to avoid all the harms I already outlined and even more dramatic versions of those harms.
And we think that people don't like spending money on taxes.
We think that there are other sustainable options that are available and that ultimately people are very likely to shift to those.
So let's talk about that.
With a carbon tax you still allow the free market activity which creates progress.
If you're a corporation and you want to pollute your environment and you want to emit, and you want to remain dependent on carbon, then you can do so.
You just need to internalize that harms.
We think that this forces companies to switch it creates a more competitive economy for green companies and for green technology.
In the status quo, green technology has to compete against an unmitigated carbon and fossil fuel lobby, an unmitigated carbon and fossil fuel economy which means that they're competing essentially at a deficit because these companies use fossil fuels don't need to internalize the harm that their fossil fuel causes.
They push that hard and therefore push that cost further down the line, further on to the consumer without having to bear at all.
We think that when you introduce a carbon tax it removes that kicking the can down the road and it means that prices will need to go up to account for this new carbon tax.
This means that corporations are going to be more likely to shift over to green technology because that green tech is already a viable alternative.
It's already somewhat similar in cost and it's already as efficient if not more efficient than fossil fuels are.
Given that this is the case, we think that companies are likely to jump on and jump into the green the green energy and the green tech craze that is already sweeping many areas of the world and that when you introduce the carbon tax it only forces that transition that is likely going to occur anyway to occur far faster than it's projected to in the status quo.
This is the change that we need to make and at the same time it bounces free market entrepreneurship and free market decisions.
For these reasons, we should introduce carbon taxes."
"We should lower the age of consent.
So by this we mean that in jurisdictions where it's not already the case we think that the age of consent should be sixteen years old for men and women and that there should be romeo and juliet laws.
So these are laws which basically say that if two people are under the age of consent, then it's legal for them to have sex with one another even if it wouldn't be legal for them to have sex with an adult.
And basically these laws are designed to prevent, you know, teenagers who are in a relationship from accidentally ending up on the sex offender registry for something that was completely consensual and probably shouldn't be illegal.
So with that in mind we're going to present two arguments for why we think these would be good policies.
The first is basically that kids will be kids.
We think that ultimately no one is being harmed if two people who are not adults yet choose to engage in consensual sexual activity.
We think that in many jurisdictions right now the punishments are extremely harsh.
In many american states people can end up on a sex offenders list, where for the rest of their life it's going to be difficult for them to get employed.
They won't be able to join the military, they won't be able to access some sorts of education, they're gonna have to tell their neighbors that they're a sex offender until the day that they die.
And this is obviously a system that was designed to go after perverts and people who are doing really awful things not sixteen year olds who hooked up after prom one night.
So we think that the law isn't actually serving the purpose it was intended to create.
We think that it's really important that we don't let the letter of the law get in the way of protecting and helping people.
So obviously we want to protect minors from being taken advantage of by adults, but we also want to recognize that people who are sixteen are probably able to consent to being in a relationship and having sexual intercourse with one another and doing that in a responsible way, particularly if we offer things like sex education in schools.
So we think that at that point the best way that the law can help these people is to make it so that there is these romeo and juliet laws so that people can engage in sex with their peers while still protecting them if they're taken advantage of by someone older.
And also by recognizing that sixteen year olds are probably able to make meaningful consent.
Which leads nicely into my second point, which is about legal consistency.
So in many american states people are able to get married at age sixteen.
You can join the military with your parents consent at age sixteen.
You can drive a car at age sixteen.
We think that all of these are probably bigger decisions than choosing to have sex.
So at that point we think that the law should be consistent.
Basically, if people are being given a high amount of authority to make decisions about their own lives, we think that those decisions should be free for them to make across the board.
I don't see why someone who is emotionally and physically mature enough to drive a car or serve in the nation's military shouldn't also be allowed to engage in a consensual sexual relationship.
It just seems that if the government is saying that that person's judgment is good enough for one, it should clearly be good enough for the other.
We think that the possibility for a third party harms or great personal risk from people choosing to have consensual sex is much lower, honestly, than driving much less getting married or serving in the military.
So we think that at that point that the government should be consistent and lower the age of consent to sixteen across the board.
And the other team might say well, it's only in america that people can do these things when they're so young.
But we still think that it's clear that sixteen year olds in different countries around the world probably have similar levels of emotional maturity.
What might be the case is that there's not enough sexual education in some parts of the world for young people to fully understand things like STDs or the risk of pregnancy and how to use contraception.
But we think that in that case it would be better to facilitate access to that information and access to contraception rather than just to ban any sort of sexual activity.
Because we don't think that's ever going to be effective.
There's no way to stop young people from having sex and the law should take that into account.
And even if it might be preferable for some people's, you know, moral or religious beliefs that young people didn't have sex at the point where they will the law should be pragmatic and acknowledge that and try to protect young people from unforeseen legal consequences like ending up on a sex offender registry and to provide information and contraceptives and things like that so that they can be safe.
So for these reasons we would lower the age of consent."
"We should adopt libertarianism.
So libertarianism is a broad term, but in this debate we're going to talk about two guiding principles that we think society should adopt that would make the world a better place to live.
The first is the non aggression principle.
This is the idea that it is unjust and immoral to act aggressively towards another person, to compel them to do something, to take something that is theirs etcetera.
The second principle is that maximizing freedom should be the first and foremost aim of any policy or any organization within society.
That ultimately promoting freedom is more important than protecting health or wealth because individuals deserve this freedom by virtue of being human beings.
It's a natural right.
So three arguments.
The first is that individuals know what is in their best interest better than anyone else.
Right now most governments around the world are sort of nanny states if I can use the british term.
For instance, where I live in boston it's illegal to smoke cigarettes in a bar.
It might be true that smoking cigarettes poses health risks to me although the state is compelling me to go smoke on the sidewalk not stopping me from smoking overall or to others in the form of secondhand smoke.
But what we tell you is that ultimately the state of massachusetts doesn't know how much benefit I derive from smoking cigarettes in a bar.
Maybe the social benefits that I gain, maybe the personal pleasure that I derive from this outweighs for me, the risks to my own health.
We tell you that it would be preferable to have the state defer to letting individual bar owners make this decision rather than making it for everyone because they also can't determine maybe some bar owners would rather have more money by letting people smoke or by selling cigarettes rather than avoiding the risk of secondhand smoke and the damage that smell of cigarettes does to their equipment.
So ultimately we think that the government just lacks the ability to make these decisions for individuals so we ought defer to them.
This is the principle of maximizing freedom whatever possible so that individuals can make their own choices and their own decisions.
Our second argument is that the state is abusive by its nature.
Imagine a world in which nobody lived in a state.
You wouldn't have to give your property up to anyone else in the form of taxation, which effectively is when the state comes and take something from you in violation of the non-aggressor principle and you would be able to freely form whatever agreements and compacts with other people that you want.
There would be no limitation on your freedom to make contracts or agreements with other individuals.
So we think that without the state people would be more able to self actualize, to do the things that they wish to do.
There would be fewer limitations on their freedom to move freely, their freedom to spend their money as they wish, to start businesses without licenses, things like that.
At the end of the day in terms of protecting us from aggression and in terms of maximizing freedom, we think that a world with less of a state would be better.
So we ought adopt libertarianism.
And our last argument is about why we think everybody craves freedom and why we think that we could better provide it.
If you imagine yourself standing behind a magical veil of ignorance which prevents you from knowing any information about yourself, you don't know if you're what your sex, or gender, or sexuality, or job, or personal wealth, or nationality are.
Behind that veil you would probably want to be able to make as many decisions for yourself is possible.
Right now governments often make laws that benefit a majority at the expense of a minority.
For instance, governments ban things that are offensive to christians and legalize things that are offensive to muslims in the united states because there are more christians then muslims.
Ultimately we don't think this is just.
We think that it is an act of government aggression against muslims for the benefit of christians and behind the veil when you don't know if you're a christian or a muslim, we think that you would prefer not to have that state of affairs exist.
So we think that the native natural state for people would be to want maximum freedom and that we could better derive that through libertarianism with less intervention by government etcetera.
For all these reasons, we think we should adopt libertarianism.
Thank you."
"We should limit executive compensation.
So in order to start the round we want to put out a model for what we think meets the boundaries of limiting executive compensation.
So we would say that we're going to set a cap on the difference between what an executive can make and what the median employee in a company makes.
So whatever the median income is in a company, we would say that executives would be capped at making something like fifty times more than that employee.
We're not going to set a hard cap, but we think that that's the mechanism that we would use for fulfilling this motion.
Alright so we're going to talk broadly about inequality, what it does now, how it exists, and why it's bad for society.
So in the status quo, the world has a massive level of income disparity and inequality and executives in many instances are making a hundred times more than the average employee or even exceeding that amount of discrepancy.
We would say that this massive discrepancy between what the average employee makes and what an executive makes is unjust for several reasons.
Firstly, when you're actually looking about the amount of labor that's being put in between the average employee and an executive, you're probably looking at people that are working roughly similar hours, dedicating a similar amount of their lives to the corporation, and we would say that the labor of an executive is simply not worth so much more.
We recognize that that labor is specialized and they have skills that the average employee probably does not have that makes their labor more valuable but we think to say that it's so dramatically more valuable that for each hour every dollar an average employee makes the labor of an executive is worth a hundred dollars or something in that range we think that that's simply ludicrous.
We think that the amount of labor you can possibly put out as an individual just cannot be that exorbitantly higher than what the average person is doing.
Secondly, a lack of mobility of social mobility means just throughout society generally means that the executive likely had structural advantages that the average worker didn't and they didn't earn that extra pay.
So because they were put in the position and this is just statistically true that if you are born in a well off position you're much more likely to be well off in the future because of that starting position and the difference in starting position between the executive and the average worker.
We would say that that more than labor is the cause of this massive discrepancy in payment and we think that that is certainly an unjust basis for that discrepancy.
We'd also say that workers' wages are deflated because of a lack of market leverage, there are simply more people that have the skills that an average worker can do than there are executives and therefore they lack leverage when negotiating income.
So why is inequality so bad in these instances?
Well, firstly we would say that executives are often the people that harm the economy and we're talking about things like the financial crisis in two thousand eight.
It's not that there were average employees that were doing things on their own, rogue employees that took down the market but rather corporate ideas and corporate plans that were put in place by those employees that executives had total total control over and pushed and that these are the people that should be punished when there are harms to the economy.
But what are the other harms of inequality?
First low worker wages means that you just have less happy, less efficient workers which means that the actual productivity of your market is less than otherwise could be.
Inequality also means that many in the market simply cannot afford the goods that the market is producing and an excess of goods means that there's labor that is being used for no purpose, for no productivity in the market.
There's also when you have a massive underclass it means that more and more people are left behind and disenfranchised by the system.
We think the beauty of the model was this it provides a path to increased compensation for the average worker.
If an executive wants to pay themselves more they can do this they just need to increase the salary of the median worker in a company and this would allow you to make that raise so we think that capping the level of inequality capping the level of executive compensation is what our model does and for these reasons we believe we should limit executive compensation."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should implement compulsory voting.
First a quick model.
So we would say that we're going to you know fine people something probably pretty meager like hundred dollars tops for any sort for missing any sort of election including municipal ones.
We would allow people to appeal their fines you know if there's a very good reason why they weren't able to vote the hospital or something but generally speaking we would say that everyone has to vote and if not they will get the fine.
So two independent points or three.
First is better representation.
So when everyone participates in a democracy you get a better proxy I think this is just intuitively true the reason why we hold elections is to proxy the will of the people that they vote for the candidates that they are most comfortable with and when you have better turn out you have a better proxying of the will of the electorate or of the of the general population.
So this is important because it first gives governments much more confidence in what they're doing.
They no longer have to you know look to the silly things that as you know proxies for what the will of the people are like that thing that they heard that person in that diner say once.
Instead they can just look to you know election results because they're just so much more reliable now.
If everyone participates in them this is truly a mandate on what the opinions of the populace are.
But secondly it allows for better representation because people who don't vote right now aren't being represented.
They're not they don't have their voices heard in congress and while this is to an extent a personal decision that they decided not to vote we think a, their other barriers to voting that I'll discuss shortly but b, that it's still just bad when they're not represented that even if it's a personal decision it's just better to have them represented than not.
Our second independent point is that implementing compulsory voting forces increased access laws from a political perspective.
In the status quo there's a lot of limits on voting.
Things like you know ID laws things like you know restrictions on when people can show up to the polls.
This is happening in a lot of states particularly in the deep south.
This is a problem because it makes it harder for people to vote and have their voices heard but we think that it's harder to implement these laws from a political perspective when everybody has to vote.
Like the thin veil behind this right now is basically like yeah we're okay with telling a couple people that they can't vote if the trade-off is that you know look illegitimate voters like non-citizens don't get to vote so I think people are going to be a lot less comfortable making that trade-off when voting is seen as something that literally every single person has to do.
If it's seen as a lot more intrinsic of a right then it is politically more difficult to implement these access laws.
So given that we think that there's going to be greater access to voting for people that want to vote but currently can't because the political pressures that are created by implementing this policy.
So the third independent point is just briefly that when you're talking about whether or not people have the right to not vote I think that that's still within the scope of you know this law.
That essentially people do have the capacity under compulsory voting to decide not to vote.
They can pay the fine but I think that's important right is that people see not voting as a way to I dont know to express discontent with the system or express their opposition to the way in which the country is being run.
You still have that capacity but you just have to pay a fine now and I think that's a reasonable trade-off because the reality is that when you don't vote that creates a level of harm right?
That creates a last representative democracy, that creates one that is less you know predicated on ensuring that every person's voice is heard and more more concerned with just ensuring that only the people that have the time or resources to vote are the ones who actually have their voices heard.
So you undermine the stability of your government when you refuse to vote.
I think we're comfortable with fining people for that.
Proud to propose."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should lower the drinking age.
Generally it's just like a principle debate, so we would defend anything really that lowers the drinking age.
But what specifically I think I want to endorse here is not just that the drinking age should be lower than it already is, specifically in the united states, but also that the united states should allow a gradient system.
One that basically has a lower drinking age for specific standards.
So you know liquor might be at like twenty one, and then at but it eighteen you have like beer and wine, and even earlier than that you can drink in a supervised setting like with parents.
So basically you could work your way up to you know full liquor consumption essentially.
So two independent points here then: the first of these is just, generally speaking, autonomy.
When people you know have the ability to you know have conformed, informed consent into a particular course of action, they should be free to pursue that course of action, assuming there aren't like really serious third party harms.
I think with consumption of alcohol you know that's pretty clear cut.
With twenty one year olds - were fine with letting them drink because of informed consent.
They understand what they're doing.
And I don't think that that informed consent meaningfully changes between when you're younger, like say eighteen or so, until you're twenty one.
If it does, the only reason is because nobody really knows a ton about you know limits when drinking and things like that until they start.
So if someone knows this by twenty one it's really only because they did so illegally, and then by the time they were twenty one they just had it figured out.
So I don't think then that by lowering this to eighteen you're suddenly going to see like a rash of increases in the harms, because broadly people did that anyway when they were eighteen.
And if they're really waiting until they're twenty one to start drinking that probably also happens.
So our second independent point then would be specifically the gradient system and why that's allows for children or young adults rather, to learn alcohol and safe practices for consuming alcohol much more effectively.
I think in the status quo there's a problem when it is illegal to drink at a slightly younger age.
Because that means that it always happens in unsupervised settings.
That you know this is something that you do with like your other young bodies you know on like, when you're like sixteen or to eighteen for the first time.
And that's a problem.
Because it means that you're a lot likely to engage in dangerous habits and drink too much or even just not know how to get back home safely or any range of bad things that can happen while you're drunk, because you don't have that experience.
Because you don't understand the risks that are you know inherent to drinking.
So this is a problem then, and we think it's significantly better when people learn you know basically the ropes, in a supervised setting.
If you look to a country like france for example, you can drink as young as five in you know the presence of your parents, this is this is good.
This means that you know when you're a teenager you can figure this stuff out in a supervised setting.
I don't think you know in terms of the health harms, there's a really significant difference between that age and say eighteen to twenty one, of when you know start learning the ropes.
And even if your parents are very conscious of these health harms and don't want you to start until you're eighteen, you still have the capacity to learn now any supervised setting, in a way that isn't legal in the united states right now.
I think a lot of parents avoid that supervised setting not just because of the you know the legal ramifications but also because the legal structure sets a social norm that this isn't an acceptable thing to do with your kid.
But it should be acceptable.
It should be something that is freely done because it helps kids make sure that they they understand what they're getting into the first time that they drink in a social setting, and that goes a long way to ensuring their safety when they drink.
Proud to propose."
"We should disband nasa.
By this we mean to say that the american government should dissolve nasa, the american space agency, and not replace it with anything else.
We have two main arguments for our side this evening, the first is that nasa is no longer needed.
Recognize that although nasa was created, on paper, to serve as a civilian space exploration agency, it was actually a front for ICBM development.
The saturn five rocket that sent all of the american astronauts to the moon was actually an intercontinental ballistic missile.
They just put an apollo launcher on top of it, instead of a nuclear bomb.
Because it was unpopular with the public to spend billions of dollars on ballistic missile research, and because the americans wanted to get a leg up on the soviets in deploying these missiles, nasa was created and billions of dollars were poured into it.
Today, the united states has enough ballistic missiles.
We don't need new and better ones, because we can already hit anywhere in the world in a matter of minutes, and we have more functional ballistic missiles than any other country.
So nasa doesn't really fill the same purpose anymore, and now that its true purpose has gone away, it's fulfilling a bunch of ancillary goals that don't really matter.
We'd also like to point out that even if you think space exploration matters, more on that in just a moment, private companies are now stepping in to fill this need.
Companies like space_x are already fulfilling contracts for the US government.
So why do we need a bloated, inefficient organization like nasa, when we can have private industry take on all the costs, and we can just contract out to them?
In particular, since the age of great manned space exploration seems to have come to an end and it doesn't seem like we're going to mars anytime soon, it seems like it's worthless to keep nasa around, since that's the only thing they're still good at.
So, the next thing that I'd like to talk about is that space travel itself is useless, and we shouldn't invest more money into it.
Now, I know that space travel holds a kind of romantic place in all of our hearts, because it's the final frontier, and we all grew up watching star trek, but space exploration doesn't actually do anything for you and me.
Defenders of space exploration usually defend it by saying that other technologies are developed as a result of space exploration.
They often point to things like the ballpoint pen or certain types of foil that are used in vehicles today, but the reason why nasa was able to produce so much useful technology wasn't that space travel is uniquely good, it's that massive government spending on science is uniquely good.
We think that if you poured billions of dollars into exploring the ocean or preventing climate change that you would also get these kind of ancillary benefits, but those things would actually help us here on the ground.
No one on earth really benefits from knowing more about what type of salt they have on mars.
So at the end of the day, the declared ends of space exploration are no good, and we shouldn't let the fact that there were some ancillary benefits to the moon exploration project convince us to keep spending billions of dollars on something that doesn't do anything to help people on earth.
The last thing I'd like to say is that spending on nasa is a misuse of the government's funds.
All government money is fungible, which means that it could be spent on other projects if it weren't spent on the current projects.
There are people dying right now in the united states because they lack access to health care or access to shelter.
There are people in puerto rico as I speak, who don't have electricity or water to drink.
Why should we be spending money to look at pebbles in space when there are real people suffering here on earth that we could help with that money?
Although nasa's budget isn't large, and I'm sure the other side will say that this money wouldn't help everyone in america, it could help some people, and we think that to those people, it's clearly better not to have nasa and instead to spend on things like disaster relief.
For all these reasons, we should disband nasa.
Thank you."
"Community service should be mandatory.
So we think that community service should be mandated for all people to do a certain number of hours every year.
We think that a reasonable number of hours would be something like fifty to a hundred hours of community service every year for every individual.
Community service can be anything from working in a local food pantry, to cleaning up debris on roads and public places, unification projects to volunteering with other members of the community and community organizations.
So that being said, let's talk about why.
First we think that every person owes a debt to their community.
Each person is reliant on their surrounding community for immense amounts of their sustenance but also for who they are.
Communities form your preferences as an individual via your environment and your learning situation.
You do not just have the identity you have out of the blue but because the community you were born into, whether you like that community or not, formed your beliefs in certain ways that made you who you are and the person that you value today.
Communities provide you with education, protection, and the social connections that are necessary for a high quality of living that allow you to live your life in a way that can be meaningful to you.
Because of this we think that each person owes a debt to their community for the labor that's been put into their own creation as an individual.
In the status quo, very few people actually give back to their community in more ways than just an annual donation or one day of volunteering on christmas or thanksgiving but there's so much else that needs to be done and so many people that are currently left behind within our communities that are invisible to us.
We think that obligations can be enforced by the government.
We do so all the time in the in the area contract law and we think the government should be able to enforce this implicit contract that exists between individuals and between their communities.
When you accept the goods that communities produce, when you choose to live in a community and be part of that community, we think that you also choose to accept these obligations.
You take these obligations on just as a nature of who you are and of your existence.
Because of this we think the government absolutely should enforce this type of community service and that this type of community service needs to be mandatory.
So secondly, let's just talk about what those good outcomes are.
We think that first you get better community service when you have more people that are willing to volunteer.
We think that there are more things that can be done when you as a say a community organization are trying to beautify one area of your city or you're trying to help one certain group in your community that's struggling.
There's only so much that you can do as a small group of people even if those people are super dedicated to trying to help their cause.
But when you simply have more labor and more bodies it means that you can do more.
There are more tasks that you can accomplish.
It also means that you have more specialized knowledge being drawn in from other people in the community which means that you can have more innovative solutions or you can bring light to new things that need to be solved, new problems that need to be addressed.
It takes those types of problem solving ideas out of the political realm that is currently incredibly hostile, and puts them into a community realm an idea where people are just trying to work together to make their lives better.
People feel deeper connections to their communities when they serve that can you and we think when in the long run after this has been mandated, you create an environment where people serve out of a desire to help their community rather than just because they're forced to.
This creates a cycle and we incredibly strong long term impacts.
We think that when no one is left behind, when you actually have community service that is robust and can help all members of the community, we think you improves lives of people that are currently marginalized, that will that go on themselves to improve the community.
It's a powerful cycle of communal growth and renewal.
We think that you owe this to your community based on the fact that you are who you are today and you've been given so much from the community that you were born into that you chose to be a part of.
For these reasons, community service should be mandatory."
"We should abolish the american jobs act.
So what we mean by this is that we think the american jobs act was a poor policy that should not be implemented.
Two arguments for this.
The first one is about the opportunity costs of the american jobs act and we're going to break this down in a few different ways.
First, let's talk about the opportunity cost in terms of money.
Recognize that all federal spending is fungible, except for things like social security.
So any money spent on this jobs act could have been spent in other ways instead.
We tell you that back in twenty eleven, when this was proposed, the federal government could borrow at basically zero percent interest rates.
It was the best time ever for the american people to borrow money.
But at the same time there was a limit to how much the american people were willing to borrow to add to the deficit.
We think that that was the perfect time to invest in infrastructure.
I live in boston, the federal government originally offered to pay for a new subway line that ran very close to my house, conveniently.
Using the money that would be borrowed against the deficit.
But because of programs like the jobs act, ultimately support for infrastructure spending fell through.
We think infrastructure would have been a better investment than this jobs act for a few reasons.
One, jobs are going to come about anyway as a result of infrastructure spending.
It's not necessary to have a separate bill here.
Two, infrastructure has large returns over time.
Many of the subway lines in boston have been in use for a hundred years.
There's no reason to assume this one wouldn't have been as well.
And the same is true for many bridges and other infrastructure projects around the country.
So borrowing a bit of money now to pay for new infrastructure could have large returns for the next hundred years or even longer.
And three, we tell you that ultimately, infrastructure spending is has more political support and that people are more willing to pay for something concrete then something abstract.
So ultimately we think that because of the opportunity cost and the trade off with infrastructure spending, that the jobs act was poorly timed and not a very good use of our money.
But the second sense in which this has a huge opportunity cost, is in terms of political will.
In order for barack obama to get this policy put into place, he would have to rely on the support of democrats in congress and certain moderate republicans quite likely.
There's a limited number of times that obama can offer people favors to support his policies, especially when many of these spending for the job act would not have helped people in every constituency.
So it's less likely that we would have seen things like healthcare reform if this act had been put into place because there would have been a trade off in obama's ability to get legislators to follow his agenda.
At that point we think that there are better uses of the president's political power, things like further healthcare reforms that would actually saves lives and also save trillions of dollars in the long term on government healthcare spending.
So with that in mind, we don't think this was the best use of the political will and the ability to whip votes that the president has.
Our second major argument is about why we think that this is risky spending though.
It's true that deficits were low but at the same time this is the kind of spending that ultimately was very unpopular with republicans.
Spending on abstract ends like job creation and funding it with tax cuts that were actually smaller than the expected spending.
So what that means is we think that this would likely feed into a narrative of obama spending recklessly.
This jeopardized the ability of the president to be reelected in twenty twelve and we think also contributed to severe democratic defeats in the house and senate in two thousand ten and twenty twelve.
But moreover we think there's a greater risk of government shut down with this kind of spending.
The american government, if you didn't know, hasn't had a budget in a long time.
Instead it kind of runs based on these short term spending bills.
And people are less willing to vote for them if they think the president is spending money unwisely.
So for all these reasons we should abolish the american jobs act.
Thank you."
"We should end daylight savings time.
So daylight savings time is a practice where during the summer we advance clocks by one hour so that what would normally be nine o'clock in, say, new york city is now ten o'clock.
The idea behind it is that it's better to give people more daylight in the afternoon so that they can play sport outside or better take advantage of their free time after work.
We think though that this policy should be ended, the policy of having a different time in the summer and winter.
Two arguments.
The first is that this undermines the purpose of time zones.
The foundational idea between having these big time zones is that it ought to be easy to calculate the time difference between any two points.
So recognize that two cities in the same time zone.
Like say new york city and boston, don't actually have the sun rise at the same time, because boston is further north and further east.
But we recognize that it's useful to pretend that they're at the same time in these two cities because they're close together and it makes it easier to do business.
And even if you had to cities like say san francisco and new york, that are in different time zones, it's easier to calculate the difference in time between a large time zone on the east coast and one on the west coast of the united states than it would be to say, ' well, in new york city at seven o three and in san francisco it's eight fifteen.
So we see that daylight savings time actually makes it harder to calculate this time because not every city and state observes daylight savings time, the rules for its application are inconsistent around the world, and even within some countries like the US and canada.
So this actually undermines the idea that it should be easy to calculate time differences.
Moreover, daylight savings time is complete the arbitrary, it's not tied to your physical location in the world in the same way that a time zone is, so we think that, yes while it's true that time zones aren't perfect, they would be better without introducing the arbitrary shift of daylight savings, some of the year and not other times, which makes it more difficult to call the entire system sensible.
Last thing, we think it makes it more difficult to do business if you change your relative hours compared to other people.
So for instance, new york city and singapore are normally twelve hours apart, but if part of the earth are thirteen hours apart, then that makes it so that people are not in the office at the same times relative to one another in say july and november, which probably makes it more difficult to organize long term projects and things like that across international borders, particularly over long distances.
And we think that as the world becomes more and more inter connected, this will only be a greater and greater problem.
So our advocacy then, our second big point is that it would be better to make it always daylight savings time, at least in most of the world.
So first of all, this would solve the idea of uncertainty.
We think that if it was always one hour further ahead, then everyone would think of that as the normal, time rather than in an adjusted time, but you would still access all of the benefits of longer days.
I think it's probably true that most people, particularly the farther north you move, appreciate having the sun up later.
Where I live in boston, the sun goes down at like four PM in december because there's no daylight savings time, and ultimately people will be better able to make use of their free time and travel to and from work if it was always one hour closer.
So I think that the issue with daylight savings time is that it is addressing the real problem.
It's addressing the idea that the sun and the clock are disconnected in many parts of the world, particularly very far north cities, but the solution to that isn't to have daylight savings just to adjust the time zones so that they actually make sense for these cities this would also end the problem of no inconsistency within countries.
Right now, some american states have daylight savings and some don't, so your time relative to say arizona or new mexico might be different during different parts of the year.
But if we always knew that boston was half an hour ahead of new york, then you would never have to make any adjustments based on time of year, you would just know it the same way that you know current time zones.
So at the end of the day, we think that it would clearly be preferable to just make daylight savings permanent in the sense of having one time zone that's farther ahead, rather than to have it change throughout the year and then have all of the harms of not having daylight savings the rest of the time.
So for these reasons, we propose"
"The energy industry should be nationalized.
An important thing here to remember, when the government nationalizes an industry, you don't remove the professional aspect of that industry.
There will still be experts who handle energy in a business-like manner.
This is just a debate about whether or not energy provision as a whole should be a competition within the private sector or whether we think that the private sector is not capable of handling that kind of burden.
The government is capable of accomplishing everything that a private corporation might provide but will do so in a more egalitarian manner.
And even if there are some efficiency or some quality harms from having the government be in charge of this, we think it's still worth it insofar as we're going to provide coverage more holistically and make sure that people aren't being abused by their energy companies as often happens in the status quo.
Two main arguments, first on removing the profit incentives.
Private companies are beholden to their stockholders and their profit margins.
This means that they're never going to prioritize the benefit or security of the average citizen.
The people don't matter to private companies and will always come second to making more money.
This is something the government is capable of overlooking.
They can choose to prioritize the well being of the citizens above the amount of money they want to make.
In fact it is their obligation to do to do exactly that because they are the government.
They are literally elected to represent the interests of the general public first and foremost.
They also collect taxes which means they can afford to take some profit cuts in order to make sure that the people are being provided for whereas even if a if a energy company is just going to be starting out or like maybe isn't as like millionaire dollaresque as we imagine them to be, it might be harder for them to be able to afford or to be able to justify taking the same kind of profit cuts in order to provide for the people.
This profit incentive is central to providing correct care.
As long as companies only care about the money they feel comfortable cutting power on children and families, they feel comfortable providing shitty service that they charge a lot for in order to keep making money, and they feel comfortable creating personal monopolies to prevent competition from accomplishing the positive things that competition can do you like have innovation and other such things.
We think that we think that at the end of the day, what matters most here is making sure that energy is being provided by an entity that actually cares about the population that needs it, because recognize also how important energy is to the average person.
We use it to power our houses, we use it to get to work, we use it to cook food, during the summer it is necessary for air conditioning in areas where it gets too hot to exist without it in the same way that it is necessary in the winter to make sure that people don't freeze to death.
At the point that these are literally peoples' lives on the line, we don't think we trust private corporations to take care of that because they are always going to be corrupt and always going to want to make money more than they're going to care about the people.
This brings us to our second independent point which is about taking care of the general populace.
The government is much more likely to actually provide for the general populace, partially because it has to be directly accountable to the people.
It looks really bad for the government when it fails at doing something like providing people energy because of how central it is to people's needs and because of the government's role as a whole as being this thing that is supposed to take care of the people and provide for the people and because the people give up so many rights to the government.
Meanwhile private corporations get away with it because they are hard to sue and have huge law teams.
There's no way to access justice against them while at least against the government even if the legal aspect is still difficult, you have optical harms that the government wants to avoid.
In the status quo the government can pretend it's not their problem because private corporations are the ones messing up.
We want to take away this excuse from the government, we want to make them directly accountable for what energy needs of the people, and we want to make sure that people are able to actually get the coverage that they need which in the status quo does not occur.
Proud to propose."
"We should ban anonymous posts.
So, a quick overview: we think that this debate is generally about websites and about online anonymous posts.
We're not going to talk about like editorials and newspapers or anything like that.
We just want to keep this debate to be we want to keep this debate clear.
We're banning this type of stuff, this type of anonymous posts on internet forums, social media, et cetera, and the regulation is going to be on the rights on the sites themselves.
So we think that it would be a regulation that's put in place that would fine a website for allowing anonymous posts and things like that.
All right.
Two big arguments here.
The first is that we think this creates a check on free speech, which is very important, and the second is that this decreases bullying.
So, firstly, that talk about free speech.
We think that free speech is a crucial right to give people.
It allows for self-expression, which allows people to learn about their own identities and to find other people that that have similar identities and to form collectives that are really that allow people to self-actualize, allow people to internalize value.
It garners an open space to air political and social ideas, which we think help society progress as a whole, and it also increases the general knowledge.
Having free speech allows us to spread information and allows knowledge to be spread across a wide base.
We also think there's a huge risk that comes with free speech.
It allows anyone to share any thoughts that they have, whether those thoughts are true or not and whether those thoughts are kind or not.
We think anonymity to the scale of the internet has never been seen before in human history.
The ability to simply post something anonymously on the web on on a website in a way that allows you to garner thousands or potentially millions of views on that thought has never been possible before.
Sure, you could anonymously post into a newspaper, you could anonymously publish something on a flyer and leave it in public, but this just isn't the same type of anonymity that we're talking about today, this widespread collective anonymity that that exists in our world.
We think that the attachment between a name and an idea is a check on the worst-case scenario that could arise from giving free speech.
And we think that what we've done in our modern society is eliminated that check through things like social media, and other anonymous online forums for spreading our ideas, and many people do not want to have those their names attached to their worst thoughts, to their worst ideas.
We think that banning anonymous posting, banning this type of anonymity would do a massive good in reining in the harms that have come from free speech, especially in the last decade or two with the rise of the internet, and we think that this would do more for allowing a more social consciousness to arise amongst the internet users and allow for a more tame internet use.
And so, we're going to talk about decreasing bullying, because I think that's a specific application for anonymity and how that comes to harm us in a really tangible way.
It's a huge problem in the world, especially for adolescents, cyberbullying, that is.
And we think it's easy to do because it can be anonymous, there's no repercussions, for example, in a school system, in the same way that if you do something publicly, there are those repercussions.
We think that this is tangibly seen.
Teen suicides and depression are way up compared to past generations.
Your online reputation and your identity are very important to someone that has come of age in this time period where where technology and the internet are synonymous with our everyday activities.
We think that banning anonymity protects children in two ways.
It prevents them from being bullied in the first place, and it ensures that people that are bullying get caught when they do bully.
It ensures that you have some sort of check that you can put through the school system.
And given in the past, that we were able to prevent these types of things on a wide scale, we were able to prevent teen suicide and these high rates of depression, we think that removing the the potential for anonymity, removing the potential for widespread cyberbullying of an individual without ever holding anyone accountable is an important way of checking the harms that we see.
We think that the same types of benefits can be gained across generations and across different social spheres, and this is just a particular application of why we should ban anonymous posts."
"We should exploit unconventional oils.
By this we mean any form of shell oil fracking, etcetera, etcetera.
Three reasons we think we should do this.
One, on short term necessity, two, on the effect on alternative fuels, and three, on energy independence.
Let's start with short term necessity.
Recognize that the amounts of oil in the world are massively depleting.
Crucially, oil has long since been a global commodity, which means that those same oil suppliers are selling to the united states, selling to western europe, they're also selling to eastern europe and to asia.
It might seem to you like oil is necessary because some fat cats want to drive their car everywhere instead of taking the bus.
What you need to understand is that people in eastern europe, for example, people in poland, in slovakia, heat their homes with oil.
This means that without oil these people actually freeze to death.
Now, why is all this important?
There are only so many countries who can afford the process of exploiting alternative fuels.
Those are the same countries that if they don't exploit alternative fuels, countries like saudi arabia, those who sell the oil, recognize that they would be willing to pay a hefty price for oil.
They therefore hike up the price to meet the demand for oil.
This prices out those places who for them oil is life, and we think that's massively problematic.
We think that creates an enormous long term need.
Even if this solution is imperfect, even with all the flaws that it surely has, there are lives immediately at stake who need to be dealt with, and this solution is immediately accessible.
So that's on short term necessity.
Secondly, let's talk about the effect on alternative fuels.
So on the other side they'll say "" look, you create infrastructure, etcetera etcetera, this pushes away the day where we all moved to green energy "".
We think we've reached the point where green energy is seen as a necessity.
Countries recognize this necessity, and the lacking of green energy is in research.
What does this mean?
It means that we have yet to find alternative fuels that are actually energy efficient if you take into account the creation process, and you take into account the availability of these fuels.
So for example, water energy is great, but it's too far away for most things, and it's not efficient enough with current levels.
Same thing is true with solar energy.
The amount of space needed to place solar panels is not worth the amount of energy you end up getting from these solar panels.
What does all this mean?
Right now these technologies are being pushed into use before they're actually ready because we're desperate to get any drop of energy.
However, investors see that the efficiency of these technologies is limited, and they move on to try and find another technology.
We think that's a problem.
We think the stress that these people are under to find proper energy right now means that they're not properly exploring in depth the potential of each form of alternative energy.
Imagine, if you were, that every paper you wrote you felt like you had to give in the next morning.
Even if you didn't actually have to give in in the next morning, the stress of that means that you're writing it hastily, means that you're rushing through it, means that you're not researching in depth and in and properly everything that comes out of your mouth or pen and paper.
That is the state of alternative energy research today.
But even if you don't believe any of that and you think this is just a worse form of gas, we say that's fine.
Energy dependence means that we don't have to be paying in to countries like saudi arabia, countries where women are still not granted basic rights, countries where homosexuals are stoned in the streets, because no one can stand up to them, because we're dependent on their energy.
We say that alone is reason enough to get any other form of energy that we can.
The environment is important.
It's important to people fifty years down the line.
Getting under the grip, out of the grip of saudi arabia is important to millions of people alive and suffering today, and that should be reason enough to exploit any form of energy that we can."
"Zoos bring more harm than good.
So, by zoos we just mean zoological parks that exist primarily in order for the public to come and see the animals that live there, rather than for any other purpose.
And by do more harm than good we think that although there are obviously good points to be made on both sides, on balance zoos cause more harm and suffering than they do goodness.
So, three arguments.
The first is that the suffering that zoos cause for animals outweighs the educational benefits that they have for the public.
Recognize that zoos, even the very best zoos, still promote poor mental health for the animals that live there.
It's a common sight, for instance, to see zoo animals pace back and forth in the same pattern all day, until they wear down tracks on the floor.
I saw this myself with an elephant in the singapore zoo which was living in a fairly sizeable enclosure, but obviously much smaller than the natural environment of an elephant in northern india, that would have hundreds of acres to roam across.
We think that particularly for the kind of charismatic large animals that people most want to see, lions, elephants, bison, ultimately it's going to be impossible for zoos to provide them with enclosures large enough to meet their needs.
What this means is that a zoo prioritizes entertainment and education for visitors over the mental health and well being of the animals that ultimately live there.
We think that every individual has a very marginal benefit from going to a zoo.
You might see some interesting animals for a few hours and learn a little bit more about buffalo or something, but at the end of the day these animals live there, you go home, go back to your bed and your house and have everything nice and normal, but the animal is permanently in this state.
So we think that ultimately, because of the long term harms to the animals, especially with regards to their mental health, that the benefits are outweighed by the harms.
Our second argument is about the misuse of funds.
Remember that money is fungible.
Any money that's spent on something like a zoo that provides facilities for tourists, gift shops, restaurants, all of these things, could be put towards actual conservation.
We're not going to deny on our side of the house that zoos do good work.
The american buffalo, for instance, would probably have gone extinct if it weren't for the intervention of zoos, and now they bounce back and are doing really well out on the great planes.
So we see that zoos do valuable work, but we would prefer to have zoological parks that focus only on conservation and that don't spend money on provision for tourists.
We think that at the end of the day, it's a gross misuse of funds for conservation to spend money on entertaining people.
Ultimately, we would prefer to have people watch animal planet or the nature channel or documentaries and things like that, rather than have them go and see these animals directly, if it means that we have more funds to spend on what really matters, which is conservation.
Our final argument is about the perverse incentives that zoos create.
So recognize that when you have a zoo, necessarily you need animals to put on display.
Now, many of these animals might have been born in captivity and are unable to support themselves in the wild.
This is true for many elephants in zoos in north america or europe, that they were born in captivity and just wouldn't know how to take care of themselves if you took them to india or africa.
But we see that zoos also create a huge market for captured animals, that in order to gain access to animals that don't breed in captivity for instance, there's an incentive for poachers or other groups to capture animals to sell to zoos.
And that oftentimes, especially in the developing world, zoos might not ask too many questions about where a valuable animal came from.
But we also think that zoos encourage mistreatment of animals.
People see the way that animals are treated in zoos and think that that's the normal way to treat them day to day, which might mean things like keeping them in small cages or forcing them to perform for entertainment, which obviously is going to be harmful for people's pets or other animals that they engage with in their day to day lives.
Or at the very least, it leaves people taking away an incorrect idea about what animals are really like, since they see them in this vulnerable mentally ill state, rather than in their natural grandeur.
So, ultimately, for these three reasons, zoos bring more harm than good.
Thank you."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should criminalize suicide.
First, some brief modeling.
We would say that the way we want to implement this is, first, just sort of like what would effectively be an in-name-only penalty on the the victim of the suicide.
We would say that, you know, obviously, like on the books, it would say, you know, whatever, there's a penalty for doing this, but like obviously you're never going to implement it because there's no living person to actually enact the penalty on, and we would say something on the family like, I don't know, like a small fine.
We would say this is only, though, in cases where they were aware that the suicide was going to occur and that they didn't do anything to stop it.
So obviously we would allow like a pretty robust appeals process for anyone who, you know, was either was not aware or, you know, made active steps to, you know, try to intervene and assist.
So, two independent points then.
The first is that we think that this policy will encourage intervention.
I think a lot of times suicide is like a really thorny topic that when brought up, people just sort of shut down and don't wanna talk about it, and this in turn means that a lot of people who are very close to the victim generally don't take active steps to intervene.
They don't really take the necessary steps that could, you know, show a person you are loved, you are cared for, you matter to people, and that can make the difference in whether or not someone does this.
I do want to underscore here that this is an important impact.
Suicide is a serious issue that not only do we hold human life in very high regard, so the death itself is obviously a significant thing to be concerned with, but also the ways in which it affects a family, the ways in which it affects a community.
The loss of a life of someone that is particularly close to you, and especially when that loss occurs in such a graphic and horrible way, is something that can have a very profound impact on individuals.
So we think then that when we put forward a policy that encourages active intervention and encourages active dialogue around suicide, we think that's always going to have a positive effect on mitigating the rate at which it occurs.
Our second independent point is that because you actually criminalize this sort of thing and you create this perception that it is a bad thing, I think you decrease a lot of the sort of almost facetious ways in which suicide is discussed, especially by some youth that that really links into the way in which suicide is stigmatized.
So I think there's like a really classic example of like teens just sort of flippantly being like, "" well, if x thing doesn't happen, I guess I'll just like commit suicide, "" right, which is like obviously this like ridiculous over the top thing that like sometimes is indicative of a very serious issue.
But there are quite a lot of examples of people just sort of like referring to suicide in a very flippant way that it doesn't because they don't really understand the ramifications of what they're talking about or because, you know, they're using it as an attention-seeking method.
We think that this is really problematic when this happens, not just for like, you know, the the standard reasons where people are just like willing to complain about that sort of dramatic behavior, but also for really serious ones that link into how stigmatized suicide is.
I think it's a thing that people don't want to talk about primarily because they'll often be dismissed out of hand as just being dramatic or over the top.
And I think when you engage in policies that mitigate that sort of dramatization in the first place the, you know, fake cases, if you will, then I think that, in turn, makes people a lot less likely to just sort of dismiss discussions of suicide out of hand and as a result, be much more willing to engage with people that are actually at risk.
This in turn, I think, leads to a better landscape for our ability to deal with this epidemic, for us to actually, you know, intervene in meaningful cases and really help people where it matters.
I think if we engage in policies that ensure that the people who are already closest to, you know, at-risk individuals are capable of having these frank discussions with them, that's always going to lead to the best outcomes.
Proud to propose."
"We should increase local government.
On our side, we would advocate for more responsibilities to be devolved from state or national level government down to the city level.
We think that, for instance, it would be preferable for the US government and the california government to devolve more powers to the los angeles city government, for instance, rather than keep them where they are right now.
Two main arguments for our side this evening: the first is that local government is more representative than higher levels of government.
Why is this true?
First of all, in most cities, you're going to have fewer people voting for each representative than for a whole state.
It's true that some cities, like new york city or los angeles, are big enough to be states or maybe even a country, in new york's case, on their own but even so, many fewer people are voting for each city councilperson or a local representative than are voting for a state representative.
So we can see that these representatives at the city level are closer to the people that they represent.
I think that this is compounded by the fact that normally these people also live in the neighborhood or the ward that they represent in that city.
So even though your state or national representative nominally lives in your district, they probably spend most of their time in the capital, whereas your city councilperson or your ward representative might live three blocks over from you, and their kids probably go to the same high school as your kids.
That means that these representatives know what is best for their community much better, because they spend all their time there, and they're interacting with the public.
And it also means that the public has more of an opportunity to engage with the representative.
You know, if my city councilperson is at the grocery store and I bump into them, I can talk to them a little bit if I want to, or if I need to get in touch with them, maybe I can set up a meeting at our kids school and have a few people from the town come in, and you can't really do that with your state representative.
So we think that this is more democratic certainly because it better reflects the will of the people and better allows the will of the people to be put into effect.
That's the first reason why we should devolve more power to local governments.
Our second argument is because we think it would promote more investment in the community.
One problem with large national or state governments is that you have to compromise between lots of different interest groups.
For instance, in california, some people who live in los angeles or san francisco want the state to invest more money in building subways in our big cities, but people who live up in the mountains don't want to spend any money on subways.
They want to spend all their money on roads because those people never ride public transit.
So you've got a big divide here and oftentimes what happens is a minority group, like these rural people who don't care about what happens in the cities, are able to block any progress from being made in infrastructure if it doesn't benefit them.
So every infrastructure project has to have kickbacks for these people in rural areas.
This makes it prohibitively expensive sometimes to improve infrastructure in our cities.
But if you devolve these powers to the city level, then people in your city who are in favor of investing in transit or fighting against traffic and all of these other problems that our cities have would be able to do so without having to please people in other districts, who are basically just filibustering everything until they get some money in their pocket.
We think this would drive down the cost of improving urban infrastructure and that this would be really good: one, because it would let people who are more low income access more jobs and more of the city, and two, because fewer people would have to drive, and we think that this would likely reduce emissions and improve air quality, and reduce the temperature in the city, and all these other things that we worry about in big cities today.
Moreover, you might think that these rural people are being put in a tough position then, they're also getting more of what they want, because they're not being ignored by cities who would have control in the state government.
For all these reasons, we should devolve more power to local governments.
Thank you."
"We should abolish the united nations security council veto power.
So right now five countries, who were very powerful at the end of world war two, the US, russia, china, britain and france, are able to veto any business of the security council.
The rotating members of the council, countries like india and germany, do not have the ability to use this veto.
So we're going to argue that the security council would be better off without veto power.
Three arguments: first, we think that the members who have been granted this power are outdated.
In particular, britain and france are not the world powers that they were in nineteen forty five.
Britain no longer controls india, france no longer has a massive empire in africa and southeast asia.
At this point, britain and france are just two medium sized countries that aren't actually that important internationally.
Except as EU members.
We think that there are many other more deserving countries, notably india and japan, who are not represented on the security council in this way.
So right now two countries that really don't matter to international relations, because they're part of nato so they're under the US umbrella, have a disproportionate influence on international law and decision making.
We think that this is unjust, that those countries don't have the power to deserve this or the population to deserve this, so they ought not be given this power.
So the other team might try to tell you that, oh we should just transfer the power to india or japan.
But that just passes the ball down the road.
Because what happens when in the future of those countries are no longer as significant?
What if russia suddenly, for instance, stops being a superpower?
We think that ultimately it's always going to be very difficult to change the security council vetoes to appropriately reflect new developments in international relations and that it would simply be better not to have the policy at all rather than to try to reform it.
Secondly, we would argue, that the veto power is undemocratic.
Right now you could have a hundred and ninety five countries all vote in favor of something, but if one of the big five countries decides that they don't want it to happen, then the policy couldn't be implemented.
We've seen this with many resolutions on palestine that have tried to force israel to recognize the palestinians' right to the west bank and things like that.
The united states vetoes them and it doesn't matter if a hundred and fifty other countries voted in support.
Since part of the purpose of the UN is to promote international cooperation, it seems that it flies in the face of that goal to let one country dictate to every other country what UN policy can or cannot be.
Even if that country is as powerful as the united states.
We think the UN should try to make the security council more democratic and that removing the veto is the most obvious way to do so and that it would allow smaller countries to have more influence on regional issues that affect them directly rather than having superpowers dictate policy to them.
Our third argument and final one, is that this prevent solutions to serious problems.
For instance, during the russian invasion of ukraine nothing was done to actually prevent the violence from spreading because russia was able to veto anything on the security council.
Indeed the US and britain didn't even bother bringing resolutions about the problem because they knew russia would veto it.
Emergencies of the sort that the UN was created to solve are not able to be resolved in the united nations because of the veto.
The other side might say, look we were able to intervene in korea during the korean war, but that was only possible because the soviet union at that time was protesting the UN for not admitting, I think ukraine, and so they weren't voting.
But in general, because one major power will always have it in their interest to support international aggression, since in practice they back all of the countries that do this, we think it's very unlikely that you'll ever be able to really solve a problem using the UN security council as long as the veto exists.
So for these reasons we should abolish the UN security council veto.
Thank you."
"The queen of england has the power to wage war, sign treaties, dissolve parliament, form governments, create lords.
The royal family is above the law.
In matters as trivial is the queen not needing a passport to travel, or not needing a license to drive a car, to matters far more serious such as the royal family being exempt for freedom of information requests.
The system of monarchy is archaic and it's counter to our democratic values and that is why we we should abolish the monarchy.
Let's talk about three main issues.
First is the dangers of the line of succession and how that threatens democracy.
Talk about the high cost of of the monarchy.
We're gonna talk about the main question of what's the point of a monarchy?
Why should we keep it around?
So let's go back to the issue of the dangers of the line of of succession and the threat to democracy that exists.
Queen elizabeth is quite a benevolent queen.
She pays taxes although she is exempt officially as queen from doing so.
She hasn't dissolved parliaments just for giggles.
She seems to not unduly try to influence politics.
But the nature of a monarchy is that we have no choice in who comes next.
We know that there's a line of succession the cannot be tempered with.
Charles is next in line and when queen elizabeth dies, no one can change that other than charles himself by abdicating.
What if prince charles is not as benevolent a king and queen elizabeth was a queen?
What if he decides to stop paying taxes?
What if he decides to interfere more heavily in politics which he can do not only in britain, by the way, but in other countries like australia where he can dissolve parliament in the other countries where he is influence over politics.
We think it's dangerous when you have a public figure who has so many powers even if they traditionally don't use them today, they have that power and when you have no when the people have no say in who comes next in line, they have no say in who is the next holder of these powers, we think that is a danger and a threat to democracy.
We think that it doubles that threat to democracy when they are exempt from so many laws and they are exempt from very serious things like the freedom of information act.
There is no transparency when it comes to the monarchy.
There's no transparency in the way they deal with their money, with taxpayer money.
There's no transparency in the way that they deal with things and they're above the law and exempt from the law and we think that that is dangerous to our democracy.
It's simply incompatible with our way of life today, one that puts the people in charge.
Second of all, we have the issue of the high cost of the royal family.
There's a huge amount of money being spent on the royal family including salaries to the larger family not just the queen, to staff, official events, security, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.
Reforming the costs is extremely tricky because parliament is dependent on the good will of the royal family of the queen.
Asking your boss to cut her own salary, or the salary of her family's, or her staff, or the number of events that she goes to, or her security, is not a particularly easy task for them to do.
And there we have the question what's the point of the monarchy today?
Yes it's a whimsical tradition but what's really the point?
Why should we have a ceremonial head of state who isn't chosen by the people, who doesn't cost hundreds of millions of pounds to upkeep?
There is no justification for it.
Coupled with the high cost financially and the high cost to our democracy, we simply have to answer the question of what's the point with there is none anymore.
There is no point to having a queen or a king who has powers that they're not supposed to be using too much, who hold extreme amounts by huge amounts of power for parliament in the in the united kingdom and yet they're not supposed to use it.
We think that there's a big problem when you have this contradiction.
We think that there's no point to keeping the monarchy around."
"We should abolish the needle exchange programs.
So, we think the principle in this debate is one in which we recognize that the purpose of needle exchange programs is supposed to stop the spread of things like STDs and other viruses that can be spread between addicts, but we think what's important to recognize is that, above all, these are costs that are associated with drug usage, but that the drug usage itself is something that is incredibly detrimental to a person's well-being, and what we mean by this is that heroin usage can ruin one's life in a number of ways, that simply outweigh the possibility that you cut down on sexually transmitted diseases.
We actually think you're more likely to get more people doing these types of drugs, doing these types of things, if you even incrementally decrease the risks that are associated with them.
So that's what we're going to talk about in this debate.
We're going to say that people are more likely to use, and that this outweighs any other considerations and things that may be gained by those needle exchange programs.
So, why do we think people are more likely to use?
Firstly, you have an infinite access to needles.
So as soon as you have one clean useful needle, or any needle that you can find, you're able to get any number of resupply from these programs, which means that in in instances in which people otherwise may not be able to accumulate the equipment to do these drugs, they now have much easier access point to get these types of things, and we think that is incredibly detrimental, because we think that it means that people that otherwise may be forced to quit by their circumstances are going to continue to use, and that's problematic.
We also think it obviously reduces the risk of a that are associated with heroin.
Things like HIV are are additional incredibly detrimental to one's livelihood.
And if you're an individual that's considering using heroin, we think that this is something that may weigh against it.
We think that maybe if someone still wants to get the high of heroin, they may go to other drugs that don't have the same types of risks associated to it, but if you decrease the risk of these external diseases, and these diseases have no pleasure associated with them, the reason people are willing to take the risk with heroin is because there is an end gain from that, but there's no end gain from contracting HIV from using heroin.
So we think that when you decrease the the likelihood of those types of things, you're more likely to get people to do these things.
And finally, we think there's a signaling mechanism associated with this.
So, even though needle exchange programs don't overtly say that heroin is okay or that this is something that people should do, when you're willing to increase the ease of access to these types of things, we think it signals to individuals that heroin isn't as bad as you otherwise signal, and you keep laws as stringent and as strict, and you don't institute these policies, and signaling is crucial.
When government and society sends a message to people, especially the people that are vulnerable or on the edge, or those that are most likely to consider using heroin, when you send those types of signals to people, it has a real impact on their psychology and a real impact on their behavior.
And we think that evens and marginally increasing the potential for people to choose to use heroin, because they think it's not as bad as they otherwise would believe.
Again, the risks associated with heroin usage, the likelihood of overdosing, the likelihood of addiction, the things that in heroin are much worse than in any other drug, we think that those things cannot be tolerated and cannot be allowed within our society.
Even though needle exchange programs may decrease the risk of other types of illnesses associated with heroin, we think that those are risks that people are able to recognize when they choose to do this drug, and are crucial in getting people to avoid using heroin in the first place, which we think should be the end goal and should be a major goal of society to avoid drug addiction and drug use, especially when it comes to heroin.
And for these reasons, we should abolish the needle exchange program."
"We should abolish foster care.
We basically model is by taking all of the money that has been put into paying foster parents, like paying for foster kids etcetera, and put that money into expanding orphanages and the quality of orphan care.
So we see like a lot of nations that don't dabble in foster care at all, we would prefer the US to follow in those footsteps and instead just make sure that the like federal orphan system is a lot stronger than it currently is.
Two main areas of clash, first on restructuring the system.
Recognize that the way that the US system currently works is that it gives money to foster parents per child, per month.
So if I'm like a foster parent who takes five kids, I receive a hundred dollars per child, per like ex number of days, and that's like a reliable source of income, and oftentimes there are ways to like cut down on the cost of the child itself that will allow me to keep a percentage of that, which we oftentimes see parents doing.
More on that later, but more importantly what you're taking away from this is that there is a lot of money pouring into these systems that could be going into the orphan system itself.
So we also see this put like money being put into recruiting these families in the first place, or to them become very systematic so they like come back over and over again, like money that goes into showing these children and transporting these children etcetera.
And what they do is they tell us that what this does is that it takes stress off of the system, but in reality if that money was being efficiently put back into the system, then that system wouldn't mind the stress.
We need to stop relying on poor stipends and instead fix the system that the majority of kids get stuck in, because we think it's problematic that insofar as most kids don't experience foster care, or if they do don't have a positive experience, that that is where the majority of the money is going, so the kids who might need to benefit most actually don't get to benefit at all off of it.
I mean it's like fundamentally unjust but also just like a poor use of funds, because you probably should be helping the majority of the children that are your responsibility.
Like a really good example of this is people who decide that they're going to learn a little bit about every subject rather than focusing on getting really good at one thing in particularly, because it's just unlikely they're going to get a job, because nobody needs someone who has a barely working knowledge of four million different fields.
Rather, you use that more efficiently by focusing on one thing and just making sure that it's a really really effective.
In the same way, we think that if people really cared about the current orphan system and they really poured a lot of effort into it, we think you would end up with a system that was a lot more functional than the status quo, where you're dividing all of your resources among so many different pots.
Our second area of clash is about just the pragmatic problems that arise.
We think that it's really unfair to children.
Recognize that the majority of foster families are industrial, they make kind of a career of taking kids in for the government funds, like treating them okay but not particularly well, they don't really have an intent to adopt them so it's not going to be a permanent home, so there's not actually any consistency as individuals are bounced from house to house, and there's also just like no way to be adopted by someone else while in foster care.
Like the definition of foster care is that you go there with this idea that it's a trial period, it was never meant to become like an industrial event where individuals are like systematically being kept there for long periods of time with people who have no intent of adopting them.
So I think what you do is you cheat individuals of the opportunity for adoption with potential other parents.
We think that it would like actually be a lot more preferable to just stay in the same orphanage.
Like we think this is better for kids' psyche, it's easier to build connections that are more longer term than like sitting in a foster home where the parents don't want to build a correction with you because they know they're not going to keep you, things like that.
We also think it becomes a lot easier to prevent abuse on our side of the house.
It's really difficult to check against individual foster parents because you're just relying on like the word of the child, as opposed to like individuals who can background check, who are working in it for the government, who work with other adults, we actually like watch them and make sure they're being good.
So and like we think that that's actually really bad because really good, because the abuse in the foster care system is like quite widespread, and that's something that we solve on our side of the house.
Proud to propose."
"Should introduce a smoking ban.
In this round, we're gonna make four main arguments as to why we should introduce a smoking ban.
The first argument is that smoking is, in a very objective sense, bad for you in every meaningful way.
We've known for decades now that smoking cigarettes causes lung damage, it causes deterioration of other faculties, it it leads to addiction.
And this doesn't only increase your chance of things like lung cancer, and cardiovascular disease, and other sorts of life-threatening diseases, but it also harms your quality of life, even if you are able to live long term.
Even if it doesn't take years off of your life, it takes time off of your life that can be lived in relatively high quality of health.
And because of this, we think that even if you don't value, as an individual, longevity of life, you should value that quality of the life that you are living, and smoking meaningfully impacts that ability to live a quality life.
In every sense of the word, it is objectively bad for you.
Secondarily, smoking is unnecessary in every way.
There is no meaningful health benefit that is derived from smoking.
There's no sort of gain that comes from an individual if they start to smoke.
And, in fact, many of the benefits that people profess about smoking, the ability to check out of their day in some way, take breaks in an otherwise very structured day, the ability for people to feel calmer, more relaxed, the sort of rejuvenation that people feel when they smoke cigarettes, this is a benefit that is only derived once those habits form.
There's no sort of benefit, there's no relaxation, no rejuvenation if you're just starting to smoke for the first time.
So, introducing a ban, we think, would prevent people from forming these habits and, therefore, these benefits don't accrue in any meaningful way, and we think that these benefits are outweighed by the objectively harmful nature of cigarettes on your health in a day-to-day life.
And we think that you can introduce this ban in such a way that you can prevent people from smoking if they're below a certain age.
You can start scaling up that age so that maybe if someone is fifty five years old and they've been smoking all their life, maybe that person is so far beyond the point of trying to help them or is so set in their ways that this ban shouldn't affect them, but you can have a sliding scale for when this would take affect.
The third argument is that this drains capital from productive uses.
Putting money into marlboro, into american spirit, into other tobacco industries is a much less productive use of that capital than if it's going into things like the tech sector, or if it's going into furthering your education, even if it's being taxed and simply going into infrastructure or defense.
There are so many other productive industries that exist that create meaningful benefits for people in their day-to-day lives that putting any money into the tobacco industry is immensely harmful, is an immensely wasteful use of that money that otherwise could be used in more productive ways, or it could just be used to save.
Smoking people that are regular smokers spend thousands up to five thousand dollars per year on cigarettes.
That's five thousand dollars a year that they can just keep in the bank and that they can use to further grow their savings, and ensure security for themselves in the long term, a long term that is likely to be longer if they stop smoking cigarettes.
And, finally, we think that it is perfectly justified for the government to paternalize.
We think that the government paternalizes by its very nature.
The existence of the government as a body that does that dictates laws, that says what you may and may not do, and sets boundaries for how you can exist is, in essence, a major body for paternalization.
And when we know as a as a society and as a government that smoking is: one, highly addictive and prevents rational decision-making, two, has no objective benefits for an individual, and three, is a poor use of resources, we think that it ticks every box that justifies the government to paternalize in this way and to ban smoking.
For these reasons, we should introduce a smoking ban."
"We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms.
This is, of course, the second amendment to the united states constitution.
Over the last two hundred and some odd years, the US constitution has been interpreted in very different ways from what was originally intended when the document was written.
There are huge debates between people who think that we should interpret the constitution according to the original will of the founding fathers and those who think that we should see it as a living document and adapt it to suit our current times.
Ironically, the conservatives, who usually favor an originalist view of the constitution, tend to take a much more interpretive version of the second amendment whereas liberals, who normally want to interpret the constitution to suit themselves, want to take a very originalist view of the second amendment.
So we're going to talk about why the second amendment should be abolished with those things in mind.
Ultimately, our first concern about the right to bear arms is the huge amount of externalities that it has.
There's always a tradeoff between individual freedom and the effects that it has on the community and we think that in the case of the right to bear arms, the balance has queerly clearly swung to the point that the harms to others outweigh the benefits to individuals.
It's true that many people who own guns are responsible and law-abiding but at the same time, the biggest problem the united states has with gun violence is not lunatics shooting up hotels in las vegas, and it's not people stealing illegal guns and using them to commit gang violence as the media would tell you, the biggest problem is actually suicide.
One reason why the US has a very high rate of successful suicides compared to other countries is that guns are extremely easy to access and very easy to use compared to other suicide methods.
So a huge part of the suicide epidemic is the fact that people have easy access to guns.
Now someone might say that this is an individual choice, but hopefully we can all agree that suicide is a health problem and that we need to remove something that is taking important members of our community away from us, namely guns in this instance, during this mental health epidemic.
But at the same time, guns absolutely are a huge reason why the US has such a high murder rate.
In a country like germany, where it's hard to get guns, it's just harder to murder someone.
So it's not that there aren't criminals in cities like berlin and paris and london, it's that those criminals don't have tec-nines, they have knives, and it's much more difficult to kill people that way.
At the end of the day, a major reason why the US has much more dangerous cities than any of its peer countries is because of the proliferation of firearms.
So we don't think that any individual can have a right to own a gun if it puts other people's lives at extreme risk.
Now, gun defenders will say, "" oh, owning a car puts people's lives at risk, "" but it's clearly not the same because the only purpose that a gun serves is to harm others whereas anything else that people own has a more constructive purpose.
But aside from all of these massive external harms that guns have, we also just think that the second amendment has been wildly misconstrued and needs to be reworded.
At the time when the US was founded, there was no national military so the individual states, think massachusetts or new york, had to provide a militia to protect the country if the british came back.
Ultimately, this proved to be an impossible way to defend the country and a military was formed, but that's why the right to bear arms exists.
And in the second amendment, they even mention a well-regulated militia.
Ultimately, the intent was never that individuals would be able to have any gun they want, although that may have been the case in seventeen eighties, but rather to have a well-regulated militia.
And because of changes in our society that the constitution has not kept up with, it's clear that we need to do something to ensure that the second amendment is not used as an excuse to harm other people.
For all these reasons, we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms.
Thank you."
"Ban strip clubs.
Three main areas of clash, first on why it is bad for societal norms.
We want to break this down across the two sexes.
First we want to talk about women because we think that strip clubs really propagate a lot of really bad stereotypes about the way that women ought present themselves and what purpose women have.
We think the problem is that even if society tries to pretend that women can do other things like they tell women that you can be more than just your body you can do things like pursue intellectual pursuits as long as things like strip clubs exist and the media reinforces their existence it is always going to be the case that there's a contradicting message sent by the general populace and sent by men.
One that says that reaffirms all of the existing norms of objectification that tells women that regardless of what else they accomplish their basic use is going to be their for their body their point is going to be attractive and we feel like the problem with that then is that it like propagates the system that we already existed that prioritizes male desires and male pleasures and male like male pursuits above anything that has to do with women.
This is literally an entire franchise created around the idea that men are going to satiate the deepest desires that women are going to satiate the deepest desires of men who come there.
We also think the problem is like it propagates incredibly problematic norms of attractiveness.
When large proportion of the population go to strip clubs and like that's one of their earlier exposures to sex and to women and like that's one of the things that even when you're a child you hear about then in the way in which those strippers look becomes part of how you think the opposite gender ought look if you are a man.
It's really difficult to be a stripper if you're above like a skinny a very skinny weight like we think of the idea they propagate is the only way in which you can be sexy or attractive is if you look in a particular manner or fit a certain image.
We also think there there's like a harm to men as well.
It narrows the way that they can see how women ought look or perform for them.
It desensitizes men to real bodies and desires the majority of women don't look like that and don't want to be sex objects but if your main exposure to like sexuality and to the way that these things work is through strip clubs that's not something that you are likely to understand.
Our second area of clash is about how it encourages other really bad behavior.
Legal strip clubs attract illegal activities and that they often become hubs of drugs, prostitution, and trafficking but it's really hard to to regulate when all of these things have a legal front attached to them ie was that quiet backroom one for personal dances or was it a back room where women were being exploited and like sex trafficking was happening.
We think that it becomes infinitely easier to expose these kinds of things and keep them actually like prevented when you ban strip clubs as a whole so that way there isn't an excuse for why that backroom exists and things like that.
Our third area of clash is about how it's fundamentally exploitative.
Recognize that the majority of strip clubs are run by men and they capitalize on women who are desperate but so that they can mistreat them ie if I am someone who cannot find a job somewhere else and recognize that even if we like to pretend that stripping can be empowering it is oftentimes the case of the people who end up at strip clubs aren't people who had their first decision to be there rather it is people who needed the money or who ended up there because they didn't have other alternatives.
What happens then is that because they are in a like in a position that is often disrespected by society they are often paid very little, there's no sexual harassment regulation because people see it as something that they deserve like these are honestly people who end up in this industry because they don't like not because they want to be there but because they get stuck there and then the industry uses them up and throws them back out.
There's very little job stability, there's very little support if you are someone with a child then that's not something that your job will ever take into account we think that insofar this is something that is only ever going to harm people it ought not exist.
Ban it."
"The motion for today's debate is that the government should subsidize massive open online courses.
What we mean by this is that there'd be a government hosted like government hosted college I'd guess online that would allow individuals to freely take classes and earn some kind of degree based on those classes.
With that, two main areas of clash, first on allowing cheap exploration.
A lot of people leave high school not knowing what they want to do with the rest of their lives and then they get stuck in two situations: either they go to college and waste their first two years puttering around classes that don't contribute to their future and waste that money there, or they don't go to college and like and often times just spend this year like not really knowing what to do.
Working a job that doesn't contribute to their future, being like kind of dead-ended for a year, and some of these people get stuck in that rut like perpetually because they can never figure out what they want exactly.
We think that subsidizing large amounts of online classes would allow people to take the best of both of these worlds and figure out what they want without paying for it.
It would also be incredibly relevant for high school students, especially those who come from schools that might be a little bit worse, those who can't necessarily afford like a mass amount of prep, we think that it's really important that now instead of having to like go to college and feel unprepared maybe I know that my school has like particularly bad science programs and so now I can go online and take it really cheaply online.
We think this is really really helpful especially for students who wouldn't be able to afford that alternatively because recognize that rich kids stuck in poor districts like their parents are just going to pay for tutors like they're capable of doing that but students who maybe show a lot of potential but don't necessarily have the money for that are stuck in poor education systems and can never break out and so we think that is really really bad and this is one of the ways by which we can counter act that is given that we are not very capable of changing the school system that they come from.
Our second area of clash is about creating university accessibility.
College is vastly becoming a prerequisite for a stable well earning career as automation takes over, as like we have more and more research positions open up but less and less need more fast food things and like stuff like that.
But college access hasn't reflected that.
A like strong college education tends to be really expensive and time and schedule consuming.
This makes it hard for people who don't have the money, need to work at the same time, or have children to ever get a degree.
Meanwhile tons of top universities videotape their classes and can aggregate them online.
It's actually really easy to make degrees accessible we just need to get over the up front costs that governments can help with.
Moreover, we need to start normalizing the validity of online classes so that people don't stigmatize it.
In the status quo it's really common for someone to get a degree from an online school and for that to be seen as like a fake degree because you didn't go to college because you like didn't experience the test taking environment and we think that's a really really silly like insofar as we have the technology to take online tests insofar as we have the technology to like let people access educations from their homes we don't understand why the fact that like sometimes I went to class versus someone who didn't have the opportunity to be there physically but still learned all the same material ought be treated differently within the workplace.
And given that this is like a pretty large problem for a lot of people, we think that normalization is really really important insofar as we think that people probably should get jobs in the fields that they're passionate about and jobs in like what they have learned about previously and that only happens on our side of the house when you actually make those fields more available both in terms of like physically taking classes there but also in terms of being able to get a job without the employer saying well because you got this online and this other person got it in person, we don't care about you as much.
And we think the government signaling here is also really valuable like when the government says look like we think that these are equally valuable, we're providing this then people intrinsically have more trust in the government and so like given that the government endorses it are more likely to endorse it as well.
Proud to propose."
"We should ban corporal punishment in the home.
On our side, we're going to explain to you why this is a cruel practice and also about the long-term harms that it presents to children.
So, first, why is corporal punishment cruel?
Well, essentially, the idea of corporal punishment is that because adults are bigger than children, they should be able to beat them and violate their bodily autonomy in order to stop them from doing something bad.
And I think it's clear that this is cruel because nowhere that we would look to as a civil liberal country allows this behavior to be used for adults.
So, in US or EU prisons, you can't beat prisoners with a rod, but many people around the world make their children cut a switch or beat their children with a slipper or something analogous.
I think that it's clear that there's a double standard here therefore.
No one'd be okay with the government caning people in america the way that they do in singapore, but most americans or many americans, at any rate, are perfectly comfortable with a parent using a flip flop or a sandal to beat their child.
I think that oftentimes you can tell if something is a bad idea if you wouldn't allow it to be done to yourself, right?
Imagine if you didn't know how old you were, if you were behind some sort of magical veil that took away your knowledge of how old you were and where you lived and that sort of thing, would you want to live in a society that beats people for an arbitrary reason, namely that they're a child, or a society that doesn't?
Well I think almost anyone would want to be free of arbitrary violence in case it affects them and, therefore, that almost everyone would think that we should ban physical punishment of children.
This is absolutely cruel and unusual, and we can tell that because of our reluctance to apply it to prisoners or to other adults.
We're just treating children differently for something completely arbitrary, namely the year in which they were born, and subjecting them to a punishment that we don't even subject adults to although generally we try to protect children.
So it seems clear to me that because of this cruelty, we need to ban corporal punishment.
But our second argument is that even if you don't think it's cruel to beat your children, it still has negative long-term effects.
Children who beat are beaten are much more likely to beat their own children or their spouse when they become adults.
This shouldn't be that surprising.
Children learn norms and acceptable behavior from adults and once those norms are instilled in childhood, it's very difficult to change them later on.
So if you have children grow up in a family where violence is coded as acceptable, because if they do something bad they're going to be beaten by their mother or father, then obviously those people are going to grow up and think that violence is more acceptable than someone who didn't have violence in their home as a child.
So these people are more likely to be spousal abusers or to beat their children than people who weren't put in this position.
But, moreover, these children are also likely to have certain psychological issues.
Psychologists have found that children find it more difficult to trust their parents and other authority figures if they're beaten when they're young, so this can lead to people having trust issues throughout the course of their life.
So it seems clear that this can limit people's success and also that this has very acyclical harms, and I think that that's a pretty good reason for the government to step in.
Many people argue that they should be allowed to beat their children because it's a decision that only affects their child, but if this leads to someone being unable to work as effectively or unable to participate as effectively in society because of trust issues, and if this leads to someone beating their spouse or beating their children, then it's clear that this has effects on third parties and actually does go beyond just the confines of this one person's home.
So because it's cruel and unusual and because of the long-term damage that it does to children, we should ban corporal punishment.
Thank you."
"We should legalize same-sex marriage.
We want to define exactly what we're talking about in this round.
We think that when we're talking about the legalization of same-sex marriage, we're confining it explicitly to marriage that is sanctioned by the government.
We don't really care what churches themselves decide to do and what religious organizations want to do.
We're saying that if the government is going to recognize marriage, in general, and provide benefits that come along with marriage and privileges that come along with marriage legally, it must accept the marriage of of same-sex individuals to each other, and that's what we're talking about in this round.
Okay, so two main arguments: the first is about equality under the law and why a just state would demand that we allow same-sex marriage, and the second is about why, just straight up, being LGBT is not something that is immoral, it's not something that we should condemn as a state, and it's something that we shouldn't try and make it legal through our laws.
It's just not a moral act that is worth condemning or not a moral act in general.
Okay.
So equality under the law: we think churches should be allowed to do whatever they want.
But once marriage is a legal institution, you need to allow equal access to all people.
The fundamental the fundamental underpinnings of a just state is that a just state reacts equally and responsibly and in the same measure to all people that are under its control, that it ensures that there are the same legal protections that are made available to all people despite what they might believe, despite what they might feel, despite the backgrounds that they might have, that a just state does not differentiate between different classes and groups of people based on inalienable aspects about who they are.
Given that this is the case, what are some of those things that the that the state actually gives when two people are married?
It gives certain tax breaks, it gives spousal benefits that range from being able to visit your spouse when you're in a hospital, to being able to gain your spouse's estate when they die, all these types of things that, legally, two spouses can combine and two spouses can do together are denied in the status quo to LGBT people.
We think that these are fundamental aspects of life: fundamental aspects of being in a committed relationship to one another is being able to make these legal commitments to one another.
And when the state denies that from these people, it's denying a very fundamental part of the relationships that we hold dear in our lives.
We think that no just state can discriminate based on these standings, and there's no harm to anyone else's marriage by allowing two people that love each other, two consenting individuals, from being together.
Given that the state gives benefits based on these things and that marriage, at its very core, is just a union between two people in a legal sense, we see no reason why you should make an arbitrary distinction between two people that want to combine their their lives and their union, who are of different genders and who are of the same gender.
All right, secondly, we don't think that being LGBT is immoral.
When the government chooses to pass some sort of a law to say that certain things must be prohibited, it de facto comes with this moral underpinning that there is something wrong about the action that we are trying to prevent, that it harms other people's freedoms or their well-beings and for that reason, we're trying to prevent these types of things.
Having someone be married to someone else of the same gender does not do any of these types of things to any other individual.
We think, however, that consenting adults should be able to do whatever they want with whomever they choose as long as they are in a consensual relationship and they are consenting to what they bring upon each other.
We think that the way of thinking about sexuality that springs up and that is the underpinning of marriage is far outdated.
It's something that we had an old way of thinking about, a rigidity about sexuality as something that is binary, and there's only one normal way for it to be, but this isn't how human brain chemistry works.
This isn't how human biology works.
It's all based on fundamental misunderstandings that come from a bygone day.
In our modern times, we think we should reflect what we know about humanity, that sexuality is fluid, that two people of the same gender can love each other and that there is nothing wrong with these relationships.
We think that those are the morals that the state should reflect.
And beyond that, in order to be just, the state must extend these benefits to same-sex individuals.
For these reasons, we should legalize same-sex marriage."
"We should increase racial profiling in the united states at airports.
So in this debate what we're arguing is that whereas right now the TSA, the security group at airports, often denies that they use racial profiling, or is forced to search people they don't want to search to avoid the appearance of racial profiling.
We should allow them instead to just openly racially profile people.
A few reasons why we think this is the case.
First of all safety.
Recognize that the reason why we have groups like the TSA in the first place is to promote airport security and to prevent another nine eleven attack from happening.
At the point where we know that the people most likely to carry out massive terrorist attacks are people from groups like al-qaeda, and at the point where those groups recruit primarily among certain populations of a given race, we think that since we're going after al-qaeda we should target the people most likely to be al-qaeda members.
Now some people might say that this is contrary to the principle that you can't discriminate against people based on their race, but we think that ultimately the trade off in terms of safety outweighs the harms to some people's individual freedom which is relatively modest.
We're not talking about like strip searching people and having cavity searches and things like that.
We're just talking about enhanced security for some individuals.
Our second argument is about fairness.
Now some people might say that it's unfair to profile one particular group.
But we think that what is being done right now is actually worse.
Because recognize that this profiling still goes on in the status quo to a great extent.
What happens in order to disguise it is that the TSA will stop one young apparently arab man at the airport and that in order to avoid charges of discrimination stop three old white women at the same airport.
We think that it's unfair to externalize these costs on to people who are very unlikely to be members of these terrorist groups and who have done nothing wrong in order to cover up this practice.
In either world racial profiling is going on.
The only question is: is it fair to punish other people in order to disguise this racial profiling?
We think that it would obviously be more fair to discriminate against fewer people, to make fewer people go through these procedures, and that therefore we should just allow explicit racial profiling at american airports.
Our third and final argument is that public will is in support of racial profiling.
Why is this important?
The united states derives its legitimacy is a government because it rests on the will of the people.
The american government is not a group of technocrats who decide what is best for the country, it is a group of representatives who are supposed to represent the interests of their constituents.
At the point where the united states is something like sixty five percent caucasian and overwhelmingly christian, probably over eighty percent, we think it's almost certain that a large majority of the country supports racial profiling against people of middle eastern background.
We think that at that point the united states must follow the will of the people, even if it has ends that are morally intolerable to some individuals.
Recognize that in the past the US has carried out lots of unpopular policies that were technically legal because of public support.
We think that we need to continue to do so now.
And if these policies are actually country to the constitution, then we should have supreme court rulings in place that prevent it from happening again.
In the meantime though, it's not up to the executive branch or individual legislators to decide what is in the best interest of the american people when they've made their own wishes fairly clear.
We think that in order for the american government to maintain its legitimacy in the eyes of its citizens it needs to implement popular, well-liked policies such as racial profiling at airports.
So ultimately, because racial profiling is going to go on either way, we think that it would be more fair to use it explicitly, and we think that the american government's legitimacy relies on public support and so therefore the policy should be implemented.
Thank you."
"Prenatal diagnosis should be mandatory.
We think that prenatal diagnosis being mandatory leads to a world that is better for the health of the child, better preparation for the family and for the parents of this child, and we think we can do it in a way where there's no real harm of making this mandatory.
So we're going to start with that first.
We believe that prenatal diagnosis as part of a comprehensive system of healthcare is something that many people are already able to access.
People that have health insurance should be able to access this type of care as a standard part of their health insurance.
So after those people, aside from those people in making this mandatory for those people, we think that we can subsidize other individual to get prenatal diagnosis done in order to ensure that the health of the baby is at a high level and to ensure that parents are aware when there are potential risks to the health of the child before that child is born.
Yes, this could be very costly, but we think it is incredibly important for the well-being of all parties involved, and we think that as a standard part of healthcare, it's something that people should have a right to be able to access and that children, because of the harm that can come from them if their parents aren't aware, have a right to have this done in their own protection.
So, firstly, on why this is better for the health of the baby.
Babies who have these health risks, who have the types of diseases and illnesses and birth defects that can be seen through prenatal diagnosis, almost always need much more assistance than regular children do.
They need either some sort of extra medical care, they need some sort of extra nursing, they need some extra benefit for them in order to grow up and be healthy.
When you, as a parent, know that this is a risk that your child is going to face, it gives you much more time and much more, the potential to gather resources to help that child with special needs is much higher than if a child is born and all of a sudden parents, in the moment that they believe is going to be a beautiful one, in the moment they believe is going to change their life for the better, all of a sudden they need to start thinking about how they're going to save this child's life.
We think that's a situation in which parents are much more likely to panic, and in which parents are going to be woefully unprepared for the challenge that they're going to face in trying to raise this child and aren't going to be able to do it in a satisfactory manner, which ultimately could harm the child after they're born.
So, secondly, on better preparation for the family.
We think that parents should know what risk they are taking onto themselves, what obligations they're taking onto themselves before they have a child.
And it is true that children that are born with health defects, with birth defects, present a different set of challenges to parents moving forward.
We think that prenatal diagnosis, making it mandatory, gives them an opportunity to make two vital decisions: first, whether or not they want to go through with the pregnancy.
Yes, it may seem kind of bad that we're going to simply have an abortion because a child has some sort of health defect, but think about the fact that if someone was going to make that decision, in the alternative world in which they didn't make that decision, they're probably not going to give that child a very good upbringing.
They're not going to provide that child with the love and support that that child needs to be successful, and having that child come to term and be born, dooms that child to a much more difficult life than they deserve to face.
If they aren't going to abort, it gives that parent time to mentally prepare themselves for the challenges they're going to face, to become aware of what is necessary of them to raise their child in a healthy manner, and to undertake all of these responsibilities prior to the child being born, giving you much more time to prepare both mentally, physically, and fiscally for the risk you're taking on.
For these reasons, prenatal diagnosis should be mandatory."
"We should abolish eminent domain.
Our model's really simple: basically, we just think it's really not okay for the government to take any property without the consent of the people who currently own it, even when they are providing compensation.
We think the people have to accept the offer.
Like, we think it's really bad that eminent domain allows the government to set a price and then just automatically get to take it, and that's something we want to be counteracting.
We have two main arguments, first on why it is principally wrong for the government to engage what is essentially stealing because, yeah, even if you gave money for it, the fact that it wasn't a consensual interaction means that it is still thievery.
Like, imagine that I saw a house I really liked and I just walked up, gave the person like a hundred thousand dollars in cash, and said the house was mine, we don't think that's okay, because that person never consented to taking that money.
They never wanted it, they never asked for it.
Similarly, if I just walked into someone's house, took like an expensive tablet or something, left like some cash on the on the desk, that's not the way it works.
Like you can't just take people's property, even if you're giving them money.
It's still thieving if that person doesn't consent to it.
So, first, it is not representative of the people when it takes from them.
The state is meant to serve the people under it.
So it's really problematic when it starts taking from them, because it means that it no longer serves the people but rather its own interests.
And oftentimes, these actually happen to be corporate interests, like when the government will seize houses because a like big oil company wants to drive a pipeline through there, and like the government will use eminent domain.
That's the government benefiting that pipeline.
There's no clear way in which that's so good objectively for the people that it's worth hurting some of their citizens.
And we think the fact that it invites these kinds of special interests is really damning for side opposition because they essentially have to explain why it's okay for the government to harm their citizens and take from their citizens for nebulous, arbitrary gains that nobody can actually guarantee will benefit the general populace.
It's also just unclear why the government has a desert claim to any land within a state.
We just wouldn't think it's fair if some large actor could just demand any of our personal belongings for a price they name.
Like, people are owned are owed consistency in their ownership.
Otherwise, it shouldn't be called ownership, in the first place, if the state can just take it.
When someone buys something, you need to honor the understanding that it is theirs.
This is what creates the laws in society that prevent chaos, because we respect that someone can own something, and that makes that item off limit.
And we think what side opposition has to explain is why it's okay for that consistency to be broken, why it's okay to inject that uncertainty and untrustworthiness into our society, like what exactly the large benefit of eminent domain is that it outweighs that risk and that untrustworthiness.
Our second argument is about maintaining trust in the government.
People need to trust and believe the government in order to feel like they should keep following its laws and contributing to its systems.
And when the government does things like take property without consent, it signals to the population that their government is more worried about special interests than the needs and rights of the general populace.
The existence of something like eminent domain is a constant threat of government overreach of the general population which creates a general feeling of ill will among them.
And these kinds of laws also are often most often used against minority groups that don't have the political capital to prevent the government from forcing them into these agreements, which which often takes away one of the few forms of wealth that people can acquire without needing old money in their family, because a lot of the time these are like houses or land that maybe were acquired a couple of years ago for a lot cheaper, but the property value has risen since then.
So when the government comes in and takes it away, you oftentimes end up with people who just can't afford another one, because this was something that was like passed down to a certain extent.
It also just allows the government to devalue property in order to get a hold of land they have no business touching, because they can just offer someone much less than the land is actually worth and prevent anyone from competing with them because of the government.
So we think you should abolish eminent domain.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should introduce compulsory voting.
First a little bit of modeling.
We think that this would basically consist of automatic voter registration.
Either we're going to have online ballots, or in the very least voting days going to be moved to a weekend.
Like we think that if we're introducing something compulsory were also going to make it as easy for people to access it as possible, and it's also going to be a situation in which like clearly this is in the united states and yeah.
So two main areas of clash: first on the alternation of societal specific norms.
So first we think that currently there's a massive problem with individuals being uninformed and apathetic about their local governments, and about their widespread elections.
They feel like their votes don't matter and they feel like they don't know enough to vote in the first place.
And currently people are okay with being like that because they know that they're not gonna vote and they've already kind of fooled themselves into believing that it wouldn't matter even if they did.
But when you actually place a pressure on these individuals, and you say that: "" look, you like you're going to have to vote when it comes down to it. ""
And you force them to face the fact that their vote will matter, we think there's much more pressure to remain informed, because you feel like you're actually going to be letting yourself and others down if you don't.
And so we think that people are going to start treating it much more like a duty and they're also going to be more pressure to inform on the part of political parties in the media.
Because if you're going to make something compulsory, and there's going to be large swathes of people who are going out who previously had not been, you're also going to have much more catering on the part of political political parties to those who they never really had faced before.
We also think that what we do on our side of the house is make voting a normal expectation.
Currently, people see voting as like a pleasant right.
It's like an option that they don't necessarily have to take, especially since they don't have to tell their friends that they didn't have to take it.
So what we would prefer is a world in which we saw voting as a specific duty that we have to do.
If we change the culture, we change the people around it as well.
So we think that as soon as we can instill this norm you're going to have much more enthusiasm about voting, you're going to have much more research about the political candidates and all that good stuff.
We also think that creating compulsory voting is likely to decrease national divisiveness.
A divided nation occurs in part because a part of that nation feels unheard and others don't reach out or recognize that they feel unheard.
But the part of the reason that they aren't recognizes because they tend not to say very much about it.
And we think that voting replaces that speech.
It allows them to stay silent without staying silent completely, because you're still going to start a conversation about this like change in the proportion of votes.
So we think that you'd actually be able to catch something like the current donald trump phenomena much earlier, because you're actually going to see people being forced to vote early on and you're going to see their political leanings and you're going to be able to ask why are we suddenly seeing this like massive demographic that has never voted like has always voted democratic or like has always been a third party, start to vote for like more extremist characters.
Our second area of clash has to do with achieving the most representative government.
Because in the end of the united states is a democracy and it doesn't want to represent the people who live within it.
So we think first that compulsory voting forces politicians to advertise to those historically disadvantaged and non voting populations.
Because currently all they have to do is isolate those populations that are most likely to vote and cater to them.
These populations tend to be the rich and like the upper middle class.
But now there's this massive new voting block and it forces politicians to inform them about what's going on because they want to have their vote.
It forces them to pass policy that these people are going to agree with because they need to have their vote.
We also think it decreases the power of money in the political system.
Currently giving cash basically gets you whatever you want, but if you have to get elected first, we think that you actually divert the attention for money to solid votes instead.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"Genetically modified crops bring more good than harm.
So these genetically modified crops are basically strains of familiar plants like corn and wheat which either grow in different conditions, or produce more food, or both, than the traditional crops that we had, say a hundred years ago.
So we have to main points.
The first is that the good that these crops have done in preventing hunger outweighs basically any potential harm.
So think about the differences between the world today and the world a hundred years ago.
Probably the most significant is food security around the globe.
We tell you that wereas things like famines used to be common even in places that are as developed now as eastern europe or parts of china, famine is basically unheard of on a large scale today.
Some countries like north korea might run the risk, but in general, if you're part of the global system then famines just don't really happen anymore.
The reason why this is possible is because so much more food can be produced from relatively small regions then could be produced a hundred years ago, and that change hasn't been made up by fertilizers or by machines alone.
The biggest difference by far has been the actual crops that farmers are planting.
There's one particular strain of rice, for instance, that has been developed, that produces more than double what a normal strand of rice would produce in a given area.
And so if you think about the famines that plagued china in the early to mid twentieth century, those will never happen again because if even one region of china now continues being able to produce rice during a bad year, then the country will not starve.
There are versions of wheat that produce many multi fold as much grain as the traditional varieties of wheat, and we've seen that the introduction of these strains in places like mexico has done a lot to increase food security there.
At the end of the day, it's important that there is food available for export at all times from food producing countries, so that another country with food insecurity can import.
Most of the famines in british india, for instance, were due to a lack of food available for import.
But now that we can produce more food in the same amount of land, it's much more likely that some region will be having a very good year and be able to export food, and this is one of the main reasons why there are fewer famines today than there used to be.
And another small point under this is that we can grow food year round now.
They can develop strains of foods like rice and wheat that grow in the wintertime, even in regions where that normally wouldn't be the case, and because of that, food is available year round.
So we don't have to worry about famine breaking out in january in the northern hemisphere, say because there wasn't enough food produced to get people through the winter.
So breaking that cycle of summer and winter, hunger in the winter, ending the cycle of famines across the globe.
These goods save hundreds of millions of lives, probably billions of lives in the long term, and that good is going to outweigh any harm the other side can tell you.
Our second point, which is kind of marginal compared to the last one, but a good, is how this helps farmers.
So if you're a farmer it's now much easier to produce more food on your land.
What this means is that you can plant less of your land with cereal crops, and more with other types of crops.
This is good for the environment because it means that you don't have to resort to monoculture as often, but it's also good because it means that there's more diversity in the food available to your community.
If you think about a place like some poorer regions of mexico, or some parts of west africa, where most of the food consumed is local, then these people can have a more diverse, healthy diet if farmers don't have to spend use all of their land in order to produce cereal crops.
We think that it's easier to diversify when there are one, more types of crops that will grow on your land, and two, you need less of your land for staple crops.
And also at the end of the day, these crops are less likely to fail or get sick, so they have less risk for farmers.
This means that these farmers, many of whom are not wealthy, even if they own land they're still living year to year based on how good their harvest is, these people now have more security, which means they can afford to send their kids to college, invest in their community, and ultimately, everyone benefits from this.
So because of the hunger prevented, and because of the benefits to farmers, genetically modified crops bring more good than harm.
Thank you."
"We should adopt libertarianism because it is both morally and practically the correct thing to do.
So, let's start by talking about what we mean by adopting libertarianism.
So, we're going to get rid of everything that is possible to get rid of as far as government services are concerned.
So what does this mean?
We're going to have only basic safety services, so things like fire and the police.
The police should be smaller than it is now as should the military.
You shouldn't get involved in international conflicts or things like that.
Basic health and safety services.
So, obviously you're gonna have to have some degree of public health to make sure that people can stay healthy and third, laws and basic legal structures to make sure that there's a way to mediate disputes between people through like a public system.
So you wanna have a public body of laws.
All of these basic things are going to be done is minimally as possible and that's how it's going to happen.
Everything else - gone.
All regulations - gone.
Everything gone.
So, let's talk about why this is just the way that we should that that things have to be.
So first I think that this is the only way to ensure that people are able to maximize their individual conceptions about the best way to live their lives.
So here's the problem: pretty much everyone in society disagrees on a lot of things.
Some people agree but by and large most people don't agree on just about everything, and the problem is is that one of the things that it's intrinsic to government interference is that it controls the way in which people can live their lives.
So every time the government passes a regulation, every time the government passes a ban or every time the government gives out a subsidy, it's directing some kind of, it's doing some kind of preference and this is going to be at the expense of some other kind of person.
So I think that this is deeply unjust because you can't just simply say that a majority of people is enough to justify the government depriving someone in some way.
For example, if the majority wants to take away someone's right to have a like gay marriage with somebody or if the or if the majority wants to spend its money on, or if the majority wants to like spend his money on something stupid, like subsidizing like like a mission to mars or whatever.
Some some like random thing like if the government wants to spend like a billion dollars on something.
These are things in which it has an impact on people.
And this is a problem because the counterbalancing solution is that you can just not spend in all these things.
People can have their own money and they can spend it on what they want to do.
And I think this is also going to be much better because this means you're going to minimize rights violations.
I think that when you take away people's property or you prevent them from exercising their autonomy in ways in which they choose, this is akin to theft.
Its theft in that you steal someone's money and you are doing what you want with it because you think that it's going to be better.
Here's the problem: just because you think that this money is going to go towards better use or just because you think a band or a regulation is going to be good for society, doesn't mean that you have a right to do that.
Because how it's best the live a life is ultimately up to the individual.
Some people may think that it's better to be free than to be like health you're safe.
That's why some people may choose to do drugs or eat unhealthy even if there's consequences about that.
People are autonomous rational beings with like free will, they can make their own choices.
That's the best way in which people can be happiest and live the lives that want to.
But finally, I think that this is going to be most efficient and effective.
And the reason for that is because I think that individual people know how to spend our money better than the government.
They know how to spend their money better than the government because if they want something then they can pay for it.
If they don't want something they don't have to pay for it.
, if they value something then they can support it.
And what this does is ultimately it makes sure that things that exist exist because individuals value them.
So for all those reasons we should adopt libertarianism."
"I'm proud to support the motion that we should cancel pride parades.
So our first independent point is that pride parades hold a high risk of hate crimes.
I think generally when you're talking about ways for a marginalized population to express some sort of political message or gain some sort of visibility, you have an inherent trade off that that visibility can often be associated with hate crimes are other forms of like oppressive attempts to hold that group down.
You know like any number of civil rights protests throughout the sixties demonstrate this trade off.
We think then that it makes sense for attempts at greater visibility and attempts at protest to be conducted in a way that minimizes risk to the participants.
This is true not just because it is obviously like bad when people are assaulted, but also because it is specifically harmful for the group.
Because assaults at a systemic recurring and targeted sense, such as at yearly pride parades, can have a chilling effect on members of the community being willing to speak up about the violence that they are facing.
Given that then, we think that pride parades are disproportionately likely to be targets for hate crimes because of the large number of people of the oppressed class being in like that one location at the same time.
Something like a mass shooting or even just like a group of people going through it like, I don't know, punching people in the face is a lot easier to conduct when you just have all of your victims in this one concentrated location.
Given that then, we think that other forms of protest are much more effective ways of ensuring that these hate crimes aren't going to hold back incidents of protests.
Our second independent point is that pride parades make it difficult for for the LGBT community to have some sort of like tight control over media narrative.
When you're talking about an oppressed group, that is you're trying to talk about the abuses they face on a day to day basis and assert their rights their right to equality, things like that, it is important to have some sort of control over the the way in which the media is going to portray you.
This is intuitively true on the basis that you know you just don't want a bad spin, but the tightness is particularly important because you don't want like radical or like just generally like mean sections of your community to become the face of it.
I think of a good example of this recently happening was a pride parade, I believe last year, that told like a group of like jewish gay people that they could not march in the parade because they were carrying the jewish flag and that they deem that like the israeli flag to be a hate symbol, because of the organizers' allegiance with like justice in palestine groups.
We think that these sacks then wind up getting like the majority of the media attention in the wake of pride, and instead of the ideal narrative work being about like: "" look, like gay communities are standing up to oppression and bigotry "", increased visibility discussions about the ways in which gay people are marginalized, like that sort of thing, instead the conversation just becomes like: "" the LGBT community is antisemitic "".
So we think then that the inability of a parade to have a centralized and controlled narrative undermines the political goals of the community.
Our third and final independent point is inclusion and exclusion within these events.
So we think then that this is like particularly important as to what the alternative type of like visibility is.
We think that the counter factual to parades is something like say concentrated media appearances by people in like nonprofits or advocacy groups, things like that.
More direct media appearances and interfacing.
The difference here is that parades by nature are organized by central committees that are often made up of established members of the community.
So we think that in the gay community this is likely to be like a lot of like white gay men, which is sort of like the old guard of, like especially in like city centers in urban areas where these parades tend to happen, is like the old guard of the gay community.
We think that these parades are disproportionately unlikely to be managed by like a more intersectional group, like say like gay women of color for example.
But advocacy groups, by virtue of the newness of their foundation, are more likely to be more representative of the community as a whole.
As a result then we prefer these other forms of media interfacing.
Proud to propose."
"Single-sex schools should be banned.
Two main areas of clash: the first on contact theory and the relationship between schooling and the real world.
We think that fundamentally school is meant to prepare you for the future and reality insofar as it teaches you workable skills that allow you to be released into the real world and function there.
But we think the problem here is the future and reality is mixed gender.
There is never a world in which boys coming from a single-sex school are only ever going to come in contact with men with the rest of their lives.
Like once you're released into the real world, it's very much one in which you interact with a multitude of genders, and we think that kids need to learn to deal with and communicate with other genders from an early age in order to set the basework that later allows them to live meaningful lives in the mixtures.
We think that it's bad, thus, to present them with a one-sided view of the world that only lets them look at it through this like lens of being from a single-gender background.
Social scenting is really real in that if you spend your entire life only learning to communicate with a specific demographic, you don't know how to speak to other people from different groups, and you're way more likely to draw from stereotypes or not ascribe equal value to the individual with whom you're dealing with.
I think a lot of the time we see this like actualized in all-male schools, where it's really easy to perpetuate the "" angry period "" trope or the "" manic pixie dream girl "" trope, because there isn't actually anyone there to correct or disprove you.
You live in an echo chamber of teenage boys who always tell you you're right, and you're barraged by the media with these ideas that like women are there to be objectified and like serve you and things.
And as such, like given no real female models that exist in your same sphere, you don't actually imagine them as individuals that need the same like attention or worth or deserve the same like credence.
And we think the problem is that these people grow up and then go into the real world.
Then they become policymakers, they become professionals who work with women and head the policies that affect them, and we don't think you can be truly empathetic to someone until you like recognize what their struggle actually is.
We think it's infinitely harder for a boy from a single-sex background to ever understand why women might need something like free tampons or pads given that, in their mind, they conceptualize periods in a very one-sided view, uninfluenced by a woman.
Our second area of clash is about single-sex schools aiding in the propagation of problematic norms.
I really want to focus on all-male schools here because I think they become the biggest perpetrator in some really problematic ways.
First, I wanna talk about misogyny.
We already told you why it's easier to believe stereotypes when you're surrounded by people all of your own background and gender, but we also thinks it become think it becomes infinitely easier to objectify women when your only model for this are the media that barrages you in the way that other boys are talking to you about it.
Like we think at the point that young men are constantly like given advertisements in which women are object, like watching porn in which women's in which women are like serving men, we don't think that it's good to then put them back with teenage boys where they're all discussing the same thing, and they have the same perception of that situation.
These echo chambers are really toxic.
Like just think about the situation with trump and the locker room talk in which it's this is the way in which they like justify their problematic behavior, where they're like, "" oh, but at least there's no women around. ""
We also think that these kind of schools become the worst growth for toxic masculinity.
Like boys are taught to compete with each other infinitely more when every single person is your competition, every single person is a boy.
Like you end up in all-male environments so there's never actually a break from them.
There're usually masculine teachers who like put their own view of who you ought be on you, and more than this, a lot of the time both like any like single-gender school tends to be infinitely harsher in terms of bullying and sexual assault.
Like a lot of the times, children use these kinds of taboo subjects to exploit each other's weaknesses and be mean.
We also think it's just really bad for any minority gender or sexuality group student, because you're stuck in this homogeneous area where there's an expectation of you to present yourself in a certain way and so, there's never actually a world in which you feel like you can break out or come out comfortably.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should ban herbal medicine.
So, by this we mean prevent its sale in pharmacies, limit use of words like medicine or cure or other similar words and have a government-funded education campaign about what herbal medicine is and how it works and doesn't work.
And by herbal medicine we mean the use of plants and fungi and similar measures which have not been proven in peer-reviewed journals or using the scientific method to have the effects that their sales people claim that they have.
Two arguments for you: the first is about corporate abuse, the second is about public health.
So, with regards to corporate abuse, we think the state needs to step in to limit the corporations that are selling these herbal medicines.
This debate is not a matter of the government stepping in to crackdown on grandma's home remedy.
It's about a large industry that has grown up around herbal and alternative medicines which are not based on scientific evidence and this industry is taking advantage of citizens.
People are being told that these herbal remedies are cures for illnesses when there's actually no evidence that they are.
They're not being told about interactions between these herbal remedies and other medications they might be taking or foods they might be eating.
They're not being told about conditions that could arise from long-term consumption of these herbs and the net result of all of this is that people are not being informed of what they're actually getting in to.
So, we think the government needs to intervene because there's just a lack of information and a huge bias in favor of the companies selling this.
We also tell you that these corporations are not being held to appropriate regulatory standards.
In the US, herbal remedies are held to the standard for food which is set by the FDA, not by whoever looks after drugs, so we see that they're not being held to a very high standard and so no one is actually checking about interactions between herbal remedies and other things that people might be consuming.
And the effect of all this is that people like children and the elderly and the ill are all being grossly affected by these herbal remedies, so people who don't have access to a lot of information and generally speaking can't look out for themselves as well as you or I might be able to are potentially being harmed because they're taking a drug in good faith which will not actually help them or might actually make their condition worse.
So, we think that the state must intervene on these people's behalf and protect them from this herbal medicine and that the only way to perfectly do this would be to ban the sale in the first place.
So, our second argument is about public health.
We tell you that public health is a common good.
Everyone is better off if the public is more healthy.
Evidence-based medicine is proven to work so we ought always defer to its use.
Recognize that we're fine if they're want to go out and do studies to prove that some herb actually cures a certain illness, then we're fine with selling it in pharmacies and having doctors prescribe it like any other drug, but we think that we always need defer to evidence when we talk about health because people's lives and well-being are on the line, as well as a lot of public money.
Recognize that poor health costs the taxpayers a fortune around the world.
In countries like britain or canada which have national healthcare systems, the taxpayer is directly responsible for other people's well-being and even in countries with private health care like the united states, if people are low-income or elderly, they're still receiving public money for their health, so everyone is losing money if people are not healthy, and necessarily, they would be healthier with evidence-based medicine we can say because we know about all the effects that the drugs are going to have and how the medicine is going to work.
But we also tell you that health care is a facilitative right and that good health is a facilitative right.
In order for people to do things like go out and vote and get educated and access other things that society tells them they have a right to do, they need to have access to health.
And if they're being misled and they're being told that something is going to cure them that won't, then they're not going to be able to access those rights.
So, we think that therefore, the state needs to intervene to protect their health, particularly for children, the elderly and other marginalized groups, and that doing this would mean banning herbal medicine until it has been proven based on evidence to work so that people aren't accessing it in good faith and then being harmed.
We think the state needs to eliminate these ineffective treatments in order to prevent people from being harmed and in order protect people's rights.
So, for these reasons, we should ban herbal medicine."
"We should abolish nuclear weapons.
In this debate we're going to argue that countries with nuclear weapons should dismantle them.
Obviously it's unlikely that trump, putin and xi jinping are going to get rid of their vast arsenals, but we think that the world would be a better place if they were to do so.
Three arguments for our side today.
The first is that the nuclear weapons pose too great a risk to our future as a species regardless of how likely they are to be used.
Nuclear weapons, as everyone knows, pose an existential risk to the future of humanity.
In the event of a nuclear war between russia and america or two other states with extremely large nuclear arsenals in the future, all human life could potentially be wiped out.
And this isn't an exaggeration.
Nuclear weapons could create effect called nuclear winter that would ultimately make the entire earth too radioactive for humans to live.
Even if the risk is very, very, very low that this will ever happen, because of mutually assured destruction, the possibility that we could wipe ourselves out as a species is unacceptable.
It would obviously be a better world if people didn't have the ability to make a split second decision that would lead to the death of everyone in the world.
And it really does come down to the judgment of individuals and split second decisions.
For instance, back in the nineteen nineties there was a fault with the russian early warning system for nuclear weapons that made it look like america had launched a handful of nuclear weapons at moscow.
Luckily the commander realized that there's no reason america would launch two nuclear weapons instead of two thousand so he didn't order a counter strike.
Instead he called up to the kremlin or whoever makes these decisions and they figured out what was going on, that this was actually an accident.
But what if he had been a trigger happy idiot?
Everyone in the world could have died.
It's unacceptable to leave the future of humanity up to a handful of officers in militaries.
We think that this risk is too great no matter how unlikely it is that something bad actually happens.
Our second argument is that even if you don't buy all of that, nuclear weapons facilitate a new form of imperialism that is extremely damaging.
Basically the reason this is true is that in order to enter the club of most powerful countries, you have to have nuclear weapons.
Otherwise you don't really pose a threat to any country that does have nuclear weapons.
Because most countries have signed on to the nonproliferation treaty, they are obligated not to develop nuclear weapons.
Otherwise they risk becoming a pariah state like north korea or iran and having their economy destroyed by the rest of the world in order to prevent them from developing nuclear weapons.
This means that the countries that do have these weapons can act with relative impunity.
No one can stop russia from invading crimea, for instance, because they have a huge nuclear arsenal.
So even if the european union wanted to do something about it, the risk would always be too great to their own citizens.
In a world without nuclear weapons, great powers would have to think more carefully before taking military action because they wouldn't be able to act with this impunity.
Hiding behind a shield of atomic bombs.
Our third argument is that there are better uses for nuclear power that are obscured because of nuclear weapons.
People around the world associate nuclear technology with atomic bombs and hiroshima and nagasaki and all that unfairly.
Because of this, people are less willing to adopt nuclear power and less willing to make the world a better place using it.
Nuclear power is the only form of alternative energy that already exists at such a level that could replace fossil fuels entirely.
You could fuel the entire earth with green energy very easily using nuclear power.
But people are reluctant to let this happen for two reasons: in countries that already have the ability to do so, people are afraid of nuclear power because of atom bombs and such, and in other countries the west is afraid to let them develop this technology in case they use it to get nuclear weapons.
So for all of these reasons we argue the world would be a better place if we abolish nuclear weapons.
Thank you."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should ban alcoholic beverages.
I think we would enact this much the same way that we enact most drug laws, that is we are fine people for , you know, possession charges and purchasing charges, things like that.
We consider much more significant charges though for people who are distributing or selling these substances, you know possibly encouraging jail incurring jail time.
So, two first I just want to establish though like a broad framework of when we're justified in enacting a ban.
I think there's a couple standards you can apply to this: so the first is information asymmetries.
And this basically just means that when people don't have sufficient information about the substance, that they are incapable of making a decision with informed consent.
Second is, you know, just sort of objective harm.
This is for example why we send people to school well against their will, because we recognize that school is just something that objectively benefits the individual.
And third is externalities.
That your right to make a decision to consume a particular substance stops at the point where no other people incur significant harms from it.
So I want to start with the information asymmetry.
That stems largely from advertisers, that because advertisers make conscious decisions to mislead individuals about the effects of alcohol, we think that there is a significant issue here.
That people, you know, don't talk about the addictive properties or the long term health effects that sort of thing.
And people then are making a decision to consume alcohol based on structurally faulty information.
Things that are fed to them by advertising firms, that are often extremely misleading.
Second I want to talk about the objective harm standard.
So I think this plays out in two ways: the first is the long term repeatedly demonstrated effects of alcohol.
Things like cancer, things like, you know, issues with your long term memory, any number of things that are incredibly incredibly harmful to individuals that drink alcohol.
But second is the addictive properties of it.
That this is a substance that is as addictive, if not more so, than many illegal drugs.
I think the problem here is that alcohol has been normalized from a cultural perspective, so we're less willing to admit that this is a serious drug, but the reality is that this is something that really ranks up there with the worst of the worst.
The withdrawal symptoms associated with alcohol really are second to none, except for you know maybe like heroin and math.
The addictive nature of the substance, it's very quick addiction time frame.
This is serious serious substance here.
And I think the only reason we take it so lightly is because of how long it's been around and how, you know, ingrained it is into our culture.
But this is something that creates serious objective harm to the individual and at that point I think we're we're warranted in constituting a ban.
Op will tell you, like, they're allowed to make a decision, you know, based on the trade off that, you know, alcohol makes you happy when you're drunk.
So is that a reasonable tradeoff?
That's only a decision individuals can make.
The problem is that because so many individuals are misled into alcohol you know by advertising firms, but also by just sort of word of mouth, I don't think that very often the people that are actually experiencing that pleasure from it, that's, I don't think that's something that occurs as much as people would like to think it is.
I think on average you know people really do suffer from this on balance.
Our third independent point is the externalities generated by alcohol consumption.
As with most most drugs, the people who suffer at the hands of it are much much more than just the individuals they consume it.
We're talking about the families that have to deal with the impacts of addiction.
We're talking about the, you know, the taxpayers that have to deal with the health impacts of people constantly going in and out of hospitals and , you know, the healthcare impacts of people paying higher healthcare premiums because these people, you know, really have a damaging impact on the health care pool.
I think there's a lot of ways in which society at large is damaged by people consuming alcohol on a widespread level, and at that point then, a ban is justified.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should fight urbanization.
What we mean by this is that we should incentivize for a living, through subsidies and advertisements, and general government good will towards people who are going to be moving from cities into rural areas.
Two main areas of clash: first on the environment.
So recognize that cities tend to be areas of incredibly concentrated air pollution due to large amounts of exhaust, both through automobile exhaust but also through just general corporation like facilities, housing, and factory exhaust, that tend to be clustered in these very very small areas, and there are also typically large volumes of uncollected waste.
So we've all seen the sides of, or a lot of people have seen photos of the like street sides of new york city, in which garbage just piles up and no one takes care of it, because there's just too much of it for any one group to make it go away for any long period of time.
And there are a few impacts that this causes: first we wanna talk about human health.
Because living in these kinds of situations is incredibly dangerous for human beings.
Not only are you going to have necessarily higher rates of asthma and lung related issues, so like pneumonia increases if you're living in a city because you're breathing in this disgusting muck and smog and like combinations of pollution, but also you're ending up oftentimes with compromised immune systems, which make you more likely to get get different kinds of diseases that could be very dangerous for you.
, it's also bad for the local animals because it causes them to be more sick.
You're inhibiting their population through pollution and loss of their habitat, food sources, and so you're actually completely destroying the natural environment and the natural animal life natural animal life.
It's also just like de facto bad for the environment.
Right?
Like it maximizes global warming insofar as you're basically getting these very very concentrated patches of like potent pollution that rise up, and you end up with like much more eating away at the ozone layer, specifically above cities than anywhere else because of how concentrated the pollution there is.
It also magnifies things like flash flooding because when you have massive swaths of concrete through these areas of cities, you don't actually have any natural drainage, which is why we see that if a like slight, like if a heavy rain or a like slight flood begins, you're much more likely to have that become a much bigger problem because you don't have any natural drainage that would take care of it.
Are second area of clash has to do with why urbanization is socially problematic as well.
First we want to talk about the individual.
Because we think that cities often offer this like false promise of success.
You think that if you move to a city you're going to have more opportunities, you'll have a higher standard of living, like you'll find all these great jobs and live such a good life.
But the problem with this is that it's a completely, it's a complete lie.
Going into a city is not likely to get you a better job.
If only because there are a million other people like you, who have heard this myth and are doing the same thing, all of whom your competing with.
So what's actually ends up happening is a worse situation than what you came from, but a difficult situation to get out of, given that you have to go back and presumably face the people that you left with shame, and given that you spent a lot of resources getting to the city in the first place.
And so it's unlikely that you have those resources to just transition back.
We also think that cities are incredibly psychologically charring: they're loud and they're crowded, there's not enough space for you.
And having to go through repeated failure and hardship is very difficult for a person's self esteem to handle.
Next, let's talk about the societal level.
Cities oftentimes end up being these cesspools of crime of high crime rates and poverty, and with really bad school systems.
Specifically because local governments can't keep up with the population growth.
And so you don't actually have enough money to take care of all of the social services that you need to take care of.
So we think that that when you like combine these costs in very small areas you're going to be able to take care of all those people, but encouraging people who live in more rural areas means of that burden is spread out over more like different local governments and like more separate bureaucracies.
So we think that you're actually going to have better allocation of resources and less poverty and less crime if you decrease urbanization.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"We should protect whistle blowers.
When we say we're going to protect whistleblowers, what we're going to do is we're going to ensure that there are certain rights protections that are put in place when someone reveals some sort of classified government information for particular reasons.
So, what we mean by this is that a whistleblower is not just some government spy handing data over to state enemies.
It's not just an opportunist who sees some way of making quick money off of sensitive information.
It's someone that is genuinely putting forward information because fear fear of what the government is doing, and because they want to illuminate the public.
They want the public to be aware of these things.
In those instances and, yes, it's nebulous to define those, but in those instances, we would make it difficult for the government to prosecute.
We would set an incredibly high standard that needs to be met to say that someone doesn't meet the protections of whistle blower, and we think that this is going to have a number of good impacts to protect from government malpractice.
We think that whistle blowers exist because the government often does things behind closed doors that either go behind the go beyond the scope of the government or are overtly corrupt: so either, government practices, government policies, that are unknown to the public that go beyond what the government should be allowed to do or are based on individual corrupt actors.
Because a political operative has an immense amount of cover and security for their actions, not only do they behave in a in a particular playing field in which they're given an immense amount of resources, the benefit of the doubt, connections with people that are in power, but they also often do these types of things behind closed doors, so it's already difficult to find out.
So, it's often impossible to discern corrupt behavior from the outside.
You need someone like a whistleblower, who is within the operation, who's within the operative's live, and within the operative's line of work, that can inform the public about the wrongdoing.
When it comes to sensitive state information, like the fact that the US has been, for a long time now, spying on its citizens and doing bulk data collection of its citizens, classified information prevents that stuff prevents information about those programs from falling into non-governmental hands.
As a populace, we know that sometimes that things need to be classified, that there are certain government actions that are only capable of being done if they are classified, and do protect the citizenry.
But we should want a system in which when the government goes too far, when the government has done something that falls beyond it's constitutional allowance or falls beyond what what the populace voted into office, what the populace popularly wanted to have occur, that someone would make us aware of those things.
Because if you don't have a whistleblower, these things can go on for decades without any sort of check.
Having whistleblower protections makes it far easier for concerned citizens to come out and make government malpractice known.
It makes it easier for those people to have the security and to know: if I reveal this I don't have to abandon my whole life.
I don't need to flee to russia or to ecuador or some other country, and I don't need to abandon everything that I've known in the world just because I'm doing what I think is morally the right thing to do.
What do we think the impacts of this are?
You get a more informed voter base, which means when government malpractice occurs, the voter base is aware of it, and they can determine whether or not we genuinely believe that the government is acting properly or new people need to be brought in to to repeal the old guard.
It also forces the public to pay closer attention to government action.
When you highlight the instances of government malpractice, we think it incentivizes people to look further into the government, because they become more aware that the government is behaving in these negative ways.
We think a more informed voter base is always good.
Yes, sometimes information is going to be released on our in our world where we wouldn't want that to be released, but I would rather live in a world in which there's a little more information out there for potential political enemies of the state to use than a world in which when government malpractice occurs, the population has no way of knowing about it.
For these reasons, we should protect whistleblowers."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should increase racial profiling in airports.
What we mean by this is that we would more often institute checks for people who are racially profiled to commit more attacks or more likely to commit attacks, and we would like generally increase these kinds of security measures in airports.
Two main areas of clash: first, on maximizing efficiency.
It is just true that terror organizations originate mostly in the middle east.
Whether we're talking about al-qaeda or isis or isil, all of them come from around the same like arabic and muslim nations that are in the middle east, and generally have people of darker skin tone who have like specific racial characteristics.
What this means is that most terrorists are also going to be from those same regions and have those same middle eastern features.
So we think that the most efficient way to catch terrorists is to do so through racial profiling, given that it is very unlikely that someone who doesn't fit those characteristics would be a terrorist, because that's just not where they would get the exposure from these kinds of organizations.
So we actually think that airports are going to stop are potentially going to stop more attacks through profiling than if they stop it, and especially now, we think that you need to increase it.
We also think that if organizations know that their members are likely to get stopped, they're likely to stop sending them in.
And we think this is really good, because we would prefer a world in which we didn't have to have these searches, because these terrorists just didn't exist in our airports.
And we think that if you send the message that these searches are happening, then they're less likely to do so because they're afraid of getting caught.
Our second area of clash is why the recent increase in attacks requires us to up the amount of racial profiling.
First, recognize that there have been a lot of recent attacks all over europe.
There have been a couple in france.
There's been increased unsettlement within the middle east itself, and we think that because of this, you need to increase security and be more vigilant in order to prevent these attacks from circulating back into the united states, as we think they probably want to.
We also think that when you whenever we experience a high volume of attacks, conservatives tend to push for very harsh race politics and race policy, so they're going to push for anti-immigration, they're going to push to like have more stop and frisk, like things like that.
And so we think that one of the ways to really easily satisfy conservatives and prevent them from being legally harsh in other spheres is to do things like increase racial profiling, because then you can say, "" look, we're doing something about it. ""
They can go back to like politicians can go back to their constituency and be like, "" look, we're like catching all of them.
We're making sure they can't get into our country in the first place or get on our planes, "" and so they're unlikely to be as awful through like legislating what countries can let immigrants in, things like that.
We also think that as bad as it seems, a lot of people are a little bit racist, and as such, it just makes them feel a lot safer to see someone who looks middle eastern stopped at the airport.
Like it makes them feel like the government is doing something, and it means they are less likely to get violent or unrestful in other ways.
Like we would prefer that the airplane airport stopped the brown person than that that brown person got attacked later on by a white person who thinks that they're a threat.
And even though it is problematic that we have to pacify the alt-right in these kinds of ways, we think it's necessary to protect the long-term safety of these people.
Because at least if the airport checks you, no one on the plane can accuse you of having a bomb, once you've already been checked.
So, we actually think that on our side of the house, you pacify the right in a way that makes more liberal legislation more likely to occur or in the very least, less liberal legislation less likely to occur.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should increase student financial aid in the united states.
We think the form of this financial aid would be multipart.
First, there would be loans that have zero interest, so they would be loans that do need to be paid back over time but do not have any sort of accumulating interest, so it's just essentially a deferred payment system.
We also think that there should be more grants given to students, that we should vastly expand the amount of money that's dedicated to just letting people go to college, that it's not a loan.
It doesn't follow you through the rest of your life.
It's straight up aid that allows people to move on once they've graduated from college.
Three reasons: first, college has gotten far too expensive.
Looking over past decades, when someone went to college in, say, the early nineteen eighties, they weren't leaving college with the equivalent of a hundred thousand, eighty thousand dollars in debt just to go to a four-year university.
Universities cost a fraction of what they did today and because of that, people were able to take out modest loans, were able to take on side jobs.
Many people were able to go to college and entirely pay for it out of pocket only by going out and getting some sort of additional job on the side, and these are things that are simply not possible today.
For the vast majority of students that want to attend a high quality university, they're forced to pay fees around forty to fifty thousand dollars each year just to attend university, and that's money that is not a reasonable expectation for people to pay.
But college is also a fundamental requisite to getting a high-paying, high-skill job in the future.
So it's not like students can just say, "" oh, I'm going to pass up on college.
I don't want to do that.
I don't want to take on the burden, "" because it means that over the course of your life, you're not going to get as good of jobs.
You're not going to be put in positions where you can succeed and be financially stable and do well for yourself and your family.
So it's a trap that we put students in, and that trap has impacts that are both problematic for students and the economy.
First, for students.
Clearly, you're just unable to save for the future.
If you have to make a one thousand dollar a month loan payment every month when you're just getting out of school on top of, for example, doing things like paying rent and paying for groceries, there's no money left over on the average entry level job salary in order to actually save money for yourself.
And so there's no way for you to save for your future until, in many instances, you're thirty, thirty five.
It's way later than it should be if you want to retire at a reasonable age.
It's also you're children are also unable to explore professional avenues that don't pay well meaning that good jobs like teaching, like volunteering, like public advocacy, these are things that are entirely outside of the realm of what these students can do simply because they're burdened with the debts of their graduation.
And they're also just simply unable to enjoy post-graduation life.
We've gone from a situation in which one's early twenties used to be a time for them to explore, to travel, to do all sorts of things, to live a life of a person that has some money.
And now it's become a time in which people just need to work and pay their loans, and work and pay their loans, and that is a drag that is unfair given that students are forced into these situations to begin with.
But additionally, college loan debt just hurts the economy writ large.
If students don't have the money to spend because they're paying off their loans, it means that money isn't going to the economy.
It's not going into things like buying homes and cars and other luxury goods.
If you look at recent criticism of the millennial generation, for example, it's that millennials don't spend money.
It's that millennials don't invest.
It's that there is stagnation on the economy, and it's not like this is just because people don't want these things.
It's because they literally cannot spend this money because that money is otherwise going to paying off student loans from the last ten years.
This is a clearly unjust system, and if we're going to force kids or highly incentivize kids to go to college, we should at least give them the funds to do so.
And for these reasons, we should increase student financial aid in the united states."
"We should increase gun control.
So obviously, gun laws vary considerably from country to country.
So the way that we're going to set this debate up is to say that we would prefer a united kingdom style of firearms regulation where it's virtually impossible for anyone to own a handgun, where urban people generally can't own a long gun and where ownership even of shotguns and rifles is very very intensely regulated and uncommon, even out in the country.
We would prefer this british model to an american model where almost anyone can acquire any type of firearm.
A handful of american cities limit access to guns but in general, if you're an american citizen, you can walk into a gun shop - there's one down the street from my parents house - just walk in and ask to buy a gun and usually walk out the same day, or maybe you have a one or two day waiting period.
So, three main arguments for why we would prefer a UK model to US model: the first obviously is that we think you'll have fewer firearm deaths.
Recognize that there are three major categories of death caused by firearm: the first are murders.
So people, especially gang members or people in organized crime, use oftentimes legally purchased guns that have been stolen in order to kill other gang members or carry out various forms of murders.
These make up a relatively small portion of gun deaths in the united states but still, there are many many many more gun deaths from murder in the US than in britain.
The second is going to be accidents.
, every year toddlers in the US kill double digit numbers of people with guns that their parents have left unsecured.
We think that the thousands of deaths caused by firearm accidents in the united states could be avoided if people had this access to firearms.
Generally speaking even if we regulate that people have to have gun safes, have to keep ammunition stored separately from firearms, in practice there's no way to enforce this.
People are going to be irresponsible.
We think that you need to take away these tools that ultimately mean that people will die because of others' irresponsibility.
And the final major cause of gun deaths would be suicides.
Many people make a very unfortunate spur of the moment decision to kill themselves and it's much easier to do this successfully with a gun than almost any other method.
You can't regret what you've done and call nine one one after you shot yourself.
It's basically instant.
So we think that you would see many fewer successful suicides and indeed, britain does have a much lower rate of successful suicide than the united states.
So we think that these reasons are all good enough to implement very strict gun control in countries like the US, comparable to what you see in countries like britain.
Our second main argument is that we think this would lead to better policing.
In the US all police officers have to carry guns because so many of the criminals that they have to apprehend are armed.
It would be very irresponsible to send unarmed police officers, you know, to raid a house or go after a drug dealer in the US because of the risk that they would be shot at.
Conversely in britain, most police officers don't carry a gun or maybe they keep one in their car but not on their person and so you see that the police are shooting many fewer innocent people.
It's obviously been a major problem in the US throughout its history but particularly recently that the police are killing unarmed young black men and we think that would be much rarer if you didn't have all the police armed.
So if you add stricter gun control we think we wouldn't need to arm the police, which would lead to less fewer of the wrongful deaths caused by the police.
And our last argument is about reducing violence abroad.
Realize that most of the guns used in the international drug trade in the americas are guns that were legally bought in the united states and then stolen or trafficked.
People aren't going and buying m-sixteens in mexico because you can't purchase them, but you can get them very easily in texas.
So what they do is they have american citizens buy them guns and then sell them in mexico or they steal guns from people's homes in the US.
So if you limited the amount of guns in the US you would see less violence in the drug trade because the supply of guns would dry up.
So for these reasons we should increase gun control.
Thank you."
"We should lower the age of consent.
Although some age of consent should exist, we would say that a system which puts people in jail unjustly and is based on arbitrary biological characteristics, should be abandoned.
With that in mind, we propose the following model.
That the initial age of consent be fourteen and that anyone between the ages of fourteen and eighteen should be able to have sex with anyone within two years of their age without legal repercussions and then at the age of eighteen, that individual should be able to have sex with whoever they want who's also over the age of eighteen or within two years of them.
Three arguments to support this motion.
First that the age of consent is wholly arbitrary.
We would say that laws ought be based on empirical realities.
They ought be based on problems we see in the status quo and would like to solve.
It is essential that laws reflect reality first off, because it makes less predictable.
Individuals can understand the basics of law simply by observing the moral standards around them and as such they cannot use the defense in court oh I did not know about the law to justify why they not should not be harmed.
We would say that they ought be based on moral truths.
Secondly, we would say that it should reflect empirical realities simply because that makes the best policy possible.
We would say the purpose of law is preventing crime and educating individuals on what they should or should not do.
At the point where we base laws on wholly arbitrary characteristics we are not really creating a moral truth or a moral standard we're simply creating an arbitrary line in the sand where government has decided that action cannot be taken.
It is clear the age of consent right now is wholly arbitrary.
There's no profound change to one's body that happens at age eighteen.
We simply recognized at the age that individuals in most states can drive, have sex, and join the military.
At age fourteen however, we'd say that that's when most individuals are beginning puberty and the system which we propose where individuals can have sex with individual with other people who are similar age as them reflects the realities of their situation.
It reflects the people that they spend time with and ought to be able to consent to having sex with.
Now our second argument is that the current age of consent laws can lead to some unjust circumstances.
In the status quo, if someone is eighteen and wants to have sex with their seventeen year old girlfriend or significant other in this case, the result of having sex in that case could very well be one of the individuals going to jail.
We would say that it is not unnatural or honestly shouldn't even be discouraged when two individuals who are approximately the same age, who have been dating for sometime, and who have clearly discussed what it means to consent with with one another, should be able to have sex without government intervention.
At the point where certain individuals are being sent to jail simply because they have sexual relations with a partner who is the same age as them but simply on the other side of an arbitrary fence put in place by the government, we would say that any system which puts people in jail like that ought to be abandoned.
Or third argument is that once again that is not the right of government to take this particular action.
We would say that the good is idiosyncratic.
That it ought to be determined that certain actions ought be determined by the individuals who understand the context around those actions.
At the point where government cannot evaluate every circumstance differently, we would say they ought not pass laws in this regard.
Courts can always adjudicate about issues of pressure, issues of consent, and we would say that side opposition in this round must prove that there are unique harms that cannot otherwise be legislated by courts.
At the point where age itself is not inherently a reason why people cannot consent, we would say that the rest of the court system can determine what whether something bad has happened based on idiosyncratic principles if we simply lower the age of consent.
Thank you."
"We should ban fast-food.
So, by ban we mean that we think government should close down fast-food restaurants and prevent them from opening, and by fast-food we mean restaurants that offer food that's prepared very very quickly, usually this might be a place like mcdonald's or burger king and we think that these restaurants become very popular around the world in the last fifty, sixty years, although they're history goes back further.
So with that in mind we have two arguments for why we should ban fast-food: the first is about why government needs to intervene.
We have three reasons: firstly, we think that there is an information asymmetry between consumers of fast-food and sellers of fast-food.
Companies like mcdonald's know full well that their food is extremely harmful for the people that eat it.
They know that there are enough calories for an entire day in a single hamburger, or that a milk shake has enough sugar for one person for several days for instance, but they keep selling it anyway.
Now it's true that government can compel these restaurants to provide more information but we think that government will always be reactive and fall behind on the harms posed by this food and that people therefore won't have access to good true information about what they're actually consuming.
Aside from that, we think that many of the people who consume a lot of fast-food are low income and lack access to the type of education to allow them to make good decisions about their own nutrition in the form of this fast-food, when they're being presented with something that seems so good but it's actually so bad.
So we think that government should intervene because there is such a large gap here, that companies are able to take advantage of people because they have access to such better information.
Nextly under this, we think that there are harms to third parties from people's consumption of fast-food.
Parents often take their children to eat fast-food for instance, which can set them up for a lifetime of obesity, if they eat this food too often, or even serious illnesses like diabetes if they end up drinking too much soda and otherwise eating too many sugary foods which we think is much more likely when people eat fast-food and other types of food.
Because when you think about the type of food being served it's often very fatty and very sugary because that's the cheapest way to provide flavorful food.
We think that government clearly can intervene in instances when there are harms to third parties, especially children, and that this is why governments can do things like ban smoking in public buildings or ban parents from smoking in the car with their children.
Lastly under this we think that there is a state interest in healthcare costs.
People who eat lots of fast-food are more likely to get diabetes, more likely to be overweight, and we think therefore that in the long term it will be very expensive to provide them with health care.
So in countries like canada and britain where healthcare is publicly funded obviously this will drive up costs, and in countries like the US it'll drive up costs for medicare and medicaid.
So the state has a financial interest in keeping these costs lower and they can do that by shutting down fast-food restaurants that directly harm people's health.
The last thing that we want to talk about, as a second point, is why we think the alternative world books much better.
We think that if you ban fast-food you're more likely to have local restaurants open up.
Compared to fast-food restaurants many more local restaurants are locally ur other restaurants are locally owned.
So we think that this will actually help local businesses and bring money into communities rather than funnel it to headquarters in another country or another city.
We think that it'll lead to better access to healthy food because it creates an economic incentive to provide this type of food.
Food deserts, for instance, are places where there is no access to healthy fresh food.
This might be poor neighborhoods in large cities for instance, that don't have a supermarket but do have mcdonalds and burger king and everyone has to spend their money there to get food.
But if those places went away then suddenly there would be a great demand for food that the market wasn't meeting.
So we think that companies would come in to fill that demand by selling them the types of food that they could prepare at home or by opening better healthier restaurants and that that would necessarily solve a lot of the health problems in these communities by giving them access to better food.
So we think that you would help a lot of people who are in a really difficult situation and on top of that increase health in general.
So clearly it's a better alternative world.
For these reasons we should ban fast-food.
Thank you."
"We should increase wealth redistribution.
So as the model we want to go for in this round, we think is fairly straightforward, what we would do would be institute a higher tax on the highest levels of income.
So in the status quo there are different tax brackets in the united states and we think that the rates of the highest tax bracket should be increased dramatically and that tax breaks and tax rebates should be given to those at the lowest level of wealth correspondingly.
So a few reasons why we think wealth redistribution, large wealth redistribution is necessary.
The first is that the status quo is a system in which we are seeing the largest levels of economic inequality since the pre-depression era.
The difference between the top one percent and the bottom fifty percent in the amount of wealth accumulated, the average median wealth, the standard of living, all these things are more despaired than they have been in the last than anytime in the last century.
The problem with this is two fold: first productivity is growing in markets all across the world.
We're in a boom period right now in which unemployment is low, in which productivity is high and yet wages are stagnant.
Which we think is is a sign that while productivity is being created by everyone the benefits of that productivity are not being felt by all people correspondingly, and that's because people, even though unemployment is at a relatively low level right now, there's still not a high competition for jobs across all sectors.
There's still a number of people that are under employed to a degree and a number of people who have stopped looking for jobs.
So even though the unemployment rate is low levels of levels of pay in income can still be low, especially for unskilled labor.
And that's what a large portion of this wealth inequality comes from.
Is that large portions of the citizenry work in unskilled labor.
But they're still creating productivity that is going to everyone.
There's no reason that the CEO and the chair people of the mcdonald's corporation should be making a thousand times more per hour than their employees that are working at the counter.
We just don't think that the actual amount of productivity that is being driven by those at the top is sufficient to merit the difference in pay between people.
And the second argument as to why this is an issue is that this is just bad for the market system.
Even if you're a proponent of free market capitalism, massive wealth inequality leads to a system in which fewer and fewer people can afford the goods that are being produced as more people get priced out of luxury goods and more people get priced out of not even luxury goods, just goods that are flowing through the economy.
It means there's less money to be spent, it means fewer people are saving, it means that there's less money to be invested.
All of these problems come from having so much money accumulated at the very highest levels of wealth.
Because you can only buy so many mansions.
You can only poor so much money into the economy until you're simply hoarding wealth to a point where it harms everyone else.
And we think of the state has an obligation to protect all of its citizens.
And in that protection we think should come some sort of basic standards of life that are guaranteed for all citizens.
Just because you're someone who's unskilled, just because you didn't go to college or just because you weren't born into the situation in which you were able to get a high paying job, doesn't mean that you should have to struggle month to month worrying about whether or not you can pay your rent.
Worrying about whether or not the two to three jobs and the sixty hours of week that you're working are enough for you to just afford being alive.
We don't think that that is a life of meaning, we don't think that's a life that is well lived and because of that we think that the government has an obligation to step in and ensure that these basic standards can be met for their citizens.
And it's not like taking away another ten percent of a billionaire's money is going to have a meaningful impact on their lives.
They're still going to be wealthy beyond the imagination of most people, but it means that more money can go to those who are struggling in their day to day lives, it means more people can have sustainable lifestyles in which they know that there is some sort of safety net for them.
And for these reasons we should increase wealth redistribution."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish standardized testing.
Two many areas of clash: the first is why we think that standardized testing unfairly benefits those who are already privileged.
Standardized testing is a skills game that can essentially be taught if you're willing to put enough time and more importantly, money, into it.
There're entire books full of tactics, such as process of elimination or other ways in which you game the test in order to get the highest score.
The problem with this is that it isn't a test of your intelligence or your ability to study or any of the other skills that you were actually need, once you get accepted to university, but rather just a test of how well you can memorize the tips and tricks given to you by your tutor.
However, if I cannot afford that tutor in the first place, I'm certainly going to do worse on the SATs than other people who did have access to the tutor because their parents were wealthier.
What this means is that the SATs and other standardized tests skew who gets into universities even more in favor of wealthy and typically white school children.
The amount of money that you make shouldn't define your future, and we think that's what standardized testing represents because, of course, there are always going to be inequalities that favor those who are richer on both sides of the house.
But putting so much pressure on one test that is exclusively available to those who are more wealthy, unlike, let's say, extracurriculars, which maybe you will be able to have more access to it if you don't also have to work a job, but at least it is available to you regardless of that status.
We tell you that tutoring and other such things are not available to you regardless of the kind of effort that you're willing to put in, because it is exclusively based on the amount of money you have.
We think that you shouldn't allow this to exist as well.
Without standardized tests, we think that you even the playing field and allow it to be more leveled, because you can let recommendations and extracurriculars and participation in class matter a lot more.
Currently, the divide of power that standardized tests have over your future is too much and favors the privilege in a much too great of a way.
We think that our side of the house greatly decreases this and allows the displacement of power to occur across more holistic methods of of looking into children.
Are second area of clash has to do with why it places too much pressure on non-holistic skills.
We think that testing is a bad metric.
You're not going to use these standardized testing skills in college.
It is much more important that you are able to communicate with your peers and your teachers and have strong study skills.
But these aren't the skills that are measured by a test, so why should it be worth over fifty percent of your chances of getting in?
We think that it is that by overemphasizing standardized test, you are sending the wrong message to children.
Telling them that if you can get these skills down just to pass this one test, you are going to be able to succeed in the rest of your life is incorrect, and unless you change the way that you appraise children for college, you're not going to be able to change the message you send.
Finally, a third area of clash.
Anxiety and depression and other mental illnesses are rising in the younger population, and the rise is largely attributed to standardized testing.
When you have to put so much effort and so much stress onto one test, and you have all this pressure because it can count for so much of your future, this causes a lot of undue anxiety in children who are much too young to handle it.
We think that this can lead to long-term problems and difficulty with handling things like stress, and we don't think that this should be what happens.
It is unnecessary and thus, should not be risking the health of our children.
Recognize that things like anxiety and depression can also manifest in physical symptoms, such as heart palpitations and increased risk for heart attacks in the future, and we just don't understand why it is happening.
At the point that these tests are unholistic, at the point that they aren't actually what you need in order to better yourself in your future, and at the point of they're unfairly privileging those who are better those who have more money, why do they still exist?
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should introduce recall elections.
Three independent points.
First is that recall elections you know make up for a more democratic government.
Generally speaking the reason why we care about democracy is that we care about citizen input into the decisions made by the government.
The reason you know we even have a government in the first place is to work for the citizens and to better the lives of the majority of the population.
So we care about having elected officials then that are very good at representing our interests.
And I think often when we elect people into office you know there is a limited picture we get of them during the election season that the election season really is just a proxy for figuring out what they're going to do when they you know get to the the legislature and actually start making decisions.
At that point then there is a sort of a failing in the democracy, there's a there's a lack of ability to really have a a perfect representation when they get up there.
And that's obviously a problem because you know there's if there's any failing at all we want to correct for that failing.
Recall elections then means that we have a means of you know taking people out of office if it turns out that they're just really really egregiously not doing a good job.
I think that you know often we will find that these aren't things that are gone about liberally yet they do exist in some states already and they're quite rare because people do have a bit of a diversion to you know radically shifting their government on the turn of the dime they want to go about business as usual but they are just some exceptional cases that really warrant having these recall elections and I think that's generally what they are going to be used for, to ensure that people are better represented.
Our second independent point though is that it creates greater accountability among elected officials.
Oftentimes elected officials wind up with this perception that there is a certain window directly after the election and leading up until you know basically about a year before they have to be reelected where they are free to make some pretty egregious mistakes because they'll have time to make up for it.
This is fundamentally a problem.
I don't think there should be any point at an elected officials career where they do feel like safe so to speak and the reason for this is that we have a very high standard for electeds.
Their decision is really really important the decisions they make that is in terms of our day-to-day lives you know they're making decisions on healthcare, on public safety, on things that are really really important to the individual person on the ground and have a serious impact.
So it's fair then to hold them to an extremely high standard and I think that's what this does.
It prevents them from having the impression that they can you know just sort of glide by the seat of their pants until the election comes back around and then just sort of you know prove their pay case again.
So our third independent point finally is just an increased confidence in the way the government works.
I think a lot of the narrative surrounding why people are so upset with their governments particularly in you know western liberal democracies lately has to do with a sense of the unaccountability that they feel that their elected officials you know basically just once they get in they stop you know regarding the voters' wishes and their that their elected officials are people that you know just sort of take advantage of the system and so do these gaps in the system that I previously explained.
I think if you get rid of the gaps, even if you don't think that elected officials are you know these monsters that are being you know horribly horribly demonized by the media even if that's your opinion, I think that when you increase that confidence in government by just enacting these types of reforms then you just minimize the rate at which you know that demonization even accures.
So it's always going to be a good thing that to ensure that elected officials you know at least from a from the perception standpoint are seen as people that act with the best interests of the people in mind and that insures that people have more confidence in their government, they you know they feel more secure in the way that their country is being run and that just you know makes them happier, makes them feel more secure and that in and of itself is a benefit.
Proud to propose."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should ban fast foods.
Three independent points.
First is that fast food is terribly unhealthy.
So I think this is fairly intuitive.
That we all understand why mcdonald's is bad.
These foods are generally rich in sodium, they have large amounts of trans fat, whatever the bad fat is, they're high in cholesterol, and they are low in nutrients.
They don't have much in the way of vitamins or other things that are actually healthy and important parts of a balanced diet.
So why then do we think that the government is justified in intervening in these problematic health decisions?
Two reasons.
First is that there's an information asymmetry intrinsic to these types of fast food.
That even if people understand to an extent that fast food is bad for you, they often do not understand how incredibly bad it is for you.
That a lot of people see it as like, oh well if I have like mcdonald's every night for dinner, that's like having like I don't know like red meat instead of white meat.
I think there are obviously lots of people, including like people like us who are disproportionately well educated, that really understand how bad this is for you, but I think generally speaking the people who consume it most are often the victims of ad campaigns that are designed to portray these types of food as equally healthy to things that are just mildly unhealthy.
But secondly, we think that there is going to be more access to healthy foods if you ban mcdonald's.
So a big part of the reason why poor families can't afford to eat healthy is because there is a premium on comparatively healthier foods.
That buying like raw fruits and vegetables and things like that is somewhat expensive by virtue of the fact that they're healthiness is a selling point.
But if you ban the comparatively unhealthy thing, that makes that a premium, then you decrease the market value of the healthy produce.
You bring down the price and you make it more affordable to families.
I think a good example of this is the fact that produce costs have gone up dramatically in the last few decades, mostly as a product of the widespread availability of cheap fast food.
If you get rid of the other force in the market that puts a premium on the healthy food, the prices go down and as a result become more affordable to poor individuals.
Our second independent point is the cultural harm that comes from fast food.
So we think that family meals where you sit down together and you spend time with your family are something that's really important.
That it strengthens the nuclear family structure when you are having this like daily interaction with your family members that forces that type of interaction and that type of structure.
And we think that the nuclear family is something that's very important, especially for children.
We think that it is something that provide structure to their lives and creates a stronger connection to individuals who have their best interests at mind.
And we think that generally speaking, it allows for support structures even for adults.
That's important to have that type of repetitive and reliable social interaction with people that you know are unconditionally attached to you.
We think that it is problematic then when that structure is weakened.
Our third independent point is wealth redistribution.
So franchises like fast food restaurants accumulate lots of money and then redirect that capital to people like say, ray kroc.
The comparative, small restaurants, generally accrue that capital to the middle class because those are the people that own these types of restaurants often.
So in this way, these small fast food joints drive inequity by funneling money from the lower classes and pushing it up to the uber rich.
Op is going to tell you that there's a trade-off here.
That the food will be pricier if it's smaller restaurants because of economies of scales and things like that.
I think we're comfortable though with that trade off insofar as we maintain capital in the lower classes, and stop the massive inequity that is being driven by institutions like the fast food industry.
Obviously this problem is bigger than the fast food industry, but we think this is still like a drop in the bucket that is moving in the right direction.
Proud to propose."
"We should ban child actors.
For the purposes of the round, we're simply talking about we're going to talk about all types of performances, but we want to limit it to professionals, so we want to ensure that obviously children are still able to put on school plays, and participate in community theaters and things like, that they should be able to express themselves, but we don't think that they should be allowed to be professional actors.
We don't think that acting should be outside of existing child labor laws that already ensure that people of certain ages aren't taken out of the classroom and forced to work.
We don't think that there's any meaningful distinction between acting and other jobs, even though acting can result, obviously in the best circumstances, in higher pay, it also comes with a tremendous amount of risk to getting into the industry, and tremendous amount of abuse.
In a given that we, as a society, recognize through existing child labor laws that childhood has a particular purpose.
Childhood is meant to be an educational and formative experience on an individual.
An individual isn't supposed to be a part of the economic system, an individual isn't meant to exist to propagate a society or type of society, or to really contribute to that society.
Society is still in the process of molding the child, of creating who the child is going to be, and because of this we don't think that they should be forced, or even allowed, but often forced, into these economic systems.
That's what we're gonna focus on primarily, is that many types of abuses for child actors, starting firstly with the fact that children aren't actually able to make a choice about doing these types of things.
Children can't rationally understand whether or not acting is going to be a long term benefit to them, they can't rationally predict what the impacts of such a career are going to be.
But parents can, and parents do often push their children and his career paths.
Child performers are often driven by parents behind the scenes that want to ensure that their children are successful in life.
Given that this is the case, we think that children aren't able to meaningfully enact their agency in these circumstances, and because of that, we don't think we can allow them to be forced into the circumstances.
Secondly, these types of circles, especially places like hollywood, are are well known for their abuse of children that come into the industry, whether it be sexual abuse, or physical, or mental abuse of these children, emotional abuse, children in these landscapes, in these environments, are often abused by the adults around them and are often either taught horrendously problematic things, or experience incredibly harmful impacts on themselves.
And even if this isn't ten or fifteen, even if it's just a small percentage of cases, we don't think that we should take the risk that is associated with children entering this industry.
We think that it would be preferable to ensure that these things never happen.
We also think it removes children from classrooms and restricts their future choice.
Now, yes, of course in the best circumstances children can make lots and lots of money, and are able to live off of their acting career as a child.
But this is the vast minority of instances.
In the vast majority of instances, whT you do is have children sacrifice a quality education for a short period of acting, for some sort of progress in an acting career, that ultimately goes nowhere.
We've seen so many child actors flame out, disappear after a number of years, but you never can get back that experience in the classroom.
You can never get back those childhood years amongst your peers, learning in the classroom and getting that experience.
And yes, you can go back and get your GED, you can go back and enter those learning environments, but when you cut yourself off to those at the most formative ages as a child, we mean people are less prone to go back and get their education, and two, are already a step behind everyone else, to the point where we think it limits their choices after their acting career is over, which for most people is at a very young age when they're still going to need to work.
Given that this is a case, that acting almost entirely sets people up or children up for failure, and that children can't actually consent to this in the first place, we think that we should ban child actors."
"Private education brings more good than harm.
So in this debate the comparison is between public schools which are run by a municipality or a county verses private schools which are run either by an entity like the catholic church or as a private nonprofit company.
In this debate we're talking about primary and secondary schooling not universities and we're talking about nonprofit schools only not the more predatory for profit schools that exists in some parts of the world.
So a good model to think of might be charter schools in america or catholic schools globally verses state run schools.
So with this in mind three arguments.
The first is that you'll have a greater quality of education in these schools.
Why is this true?
First of all, we think it's likely that private schools will be able to pay teachers more than public schools.
This is because private schools will be able to increase their budgets and charge more in intuition in order to attract the best educators.
The other team might say that charging more tuition means that fewer students will be able to attend.
But we think that the rise of fee waivers in countries like the united states and charity from groups like the catholic church, means that low income students will still have access to education and that ultimately this greater quality will be worth the cost.
That having better teachers and that creating higher salaries so that more people are willing to go on to become teachers will ultimately be the most important factor to improving education.
Ultimately you can have good curricula and good books but without good educators students will never be able to perform.
This is why we think ultimately some countries like finland have very very good education is because of good teachers.
But inasmuch as we can't replicate their model of civil service in other countries, we think that the private sector will do a better job emulating it then the public sector has in countries like britain or like the united states.
Our second argument is about access to education.
Right now the best schools are always going to be built in areas with the highest tax base.
What that means is that you have if you have for instance a very wealthy town surrounded by very poor farms in a county that ultimately the students in the town will have very good schools and the students of the county will have very poor schools, or perhaps in america you'll have very good schools in the suburbs and bad schools in the inner city.
We think that private schools can solve for this because ultimately if you want to build a good school for a certain community you can put it anywhere.
Obviously there have to be students who can pay tuition but we think that the aforementioned charity and tuition waivers from governments means that you will be able to provide better education in these cities.
At the end of the day the public sector will never be able to provide good schools for a place like detroit, because the tax base simply does not exist.
We think that only the private sector will be able to create equal access to high quality education for students there and that when you judge this debate you should weigh the provision of high quality education to students above any other concern because that's the purpose of education in the first place obviously, to benefit the students.
Our last argument is that we think that private schools will use the money that they receive from government and charity more efficiently than public schools.
When you exist in a competitive market obviously you want to use your money as efficiently as possible.
If you waste lots and lots of money on nonsense, then you won't be able to compete with other schools in your area.
This competition means that schools will have an incentive to fire under performing teachers, to lay off excess administrators, to purchase the best materials rather than repurchase materials over and over again when they aren't effective.
We think that there is a lack of these incentives in public schools where there is no competition, where there's no reason to fire bad teachers.
Ultimately we think that the only way to create competition is to allow schools to succeed and fail on a free market which requires the access to private education that we propose in this debate.
So because of a higher quality of education, because of better access to high quality education, and because of efficiency, we think that private education brings more good than harm.
Thank you."
"We should legalize cannabis.
To be clear in this debate we're not saying that we should decriminalize cannabis, but we but what we would do is legalize the possession, sale, use, every type of ownership of cannabis that you can have and we're going to do it at a federal, state, and local level.
Everywhere we say cannabis should be legal.
So we're gonna talk about three things.
The first is why the war on drugs is bad.
The seconds is about why cannabis and weed are good, and the third is about the economic boom that will come with the legalization of cannabis.
So recognized that the war on drugs is unjust.
The war on drugs simply restricts the ability for people to choose what they're going to do what their bodily autonomy.
The fact that I can't choose what I'm going to put in my own body and to do so would have no impact on other people.
You can criminalize things that you do while being intoxicated just like we criminalize driving under the influence of alcohol without criminalizing the use of the substance itself and we think that criminalize use itself and possession and sale of this particular object would need to have much dramatically worse effects than it actually does.
We we also recognize that in the status quo the way that cannabis is made illegal is incredibly discriminatory.
Individuals in the united states use cannabis at approximately the same rate between race, yet black people in the united states are exponentially more likely to be arrested and convicted for cannabis possession than any other demographic in the united states and we think that this is a method of the fact that the war on drugs itself came out of a time at which the government was attempting to oppress the votes of liberals and of minorities within the country and that that idea, that central core of what the war on drugs is about and was about maintains to this very day.
We also think that it leads to cycles of incarceration because when individuals are put in jail because of cannabis possession or cannabis sale or use of what have you, what ends up happening is they are shut out from other job opportunities in more professional atmospheres and they resort to selling drugs in the future and it only leads to a cycle of incarceration.
We think all of this is bad and makes the legalization of cannabis a necessity.
The second reason is that cannabis is just good.
It's safer than alcohol and tobacco and studies have shown that it has immense medical purposes.
It may have incredibly varied medical purposes as well and as long as we as cannabis remains legal, it's incredibly difficult to study these types of things and even if you are able to get enough cannabis in a lab to study these things, that lab is constantly a threat of being shut down.
Even if that isn't the case and you're able to do real serious research on this it's like developing a medicine that you know is never going to be able to be used.
Even if as cannabis does is shown to say reduce the risk of seizures in people with epilepsy, reduce pain for those that suffer from chronic pain, reduce symptoms of depression, and lead to people being able to eat after they've been exposed to chemotherapy for cancer, all these benefits have been shown to work from cannabis but we simply do not get the benefits of those things when it remains illegal.
The final thing I'm going to talk about is the economic boom that comes from cannabis.
When we see that states like colorado and washington have legalized cannabis in the status quo, we don't see what many denouncers expected which is a rise on crime.
We saw a slight increase in use of cannabis but this ended up going down as the law went on.
We think there is a brief spike after the fact but we think that's natural, but what we did see is a massive economic boom for people in colorado and washington because people come to these areas for weed tourism but more importantly, it means that all of the money that is currently being centralized and focused into cartels is shifted into real businesses that can be taxed and regulated.
This means that even if you think that cannabis is bad, even if you think that cannabis is something that no one should ever use, what we've seen from the war on drugs is that prohibition is massively ineffective.
What is more effective is taking the tax revenue that you get from legalizing cannabis, the millions and millions of dollars in potential tax revenues from this new industry and you put it into things like education, prevention, and all those types of metrics.
Given that the the fact that cannabis is illegal in the status quo only leads to harms.
It only leads to people not being being able to use their autonomy, get medical benefits and drastically disenfranchises people of color and other minorities in the united states.
We think that we absolutely should legalize cannabis."
"We should adopt teacher tenure reform.
The current system of teacher reform is fundamentally broken.
It rewards individuals simply for existing within the school system.
What this means is that new teachers are routinely punished simply because they are new, and old teachers who were able to get their job at a time of prosperity and when teaching was in high demand, are able to retain their positions regardless of how terrible they are in the classroom.
Because we think this is fundamentally unjust we would support the following model that throughout the united states public school districts should adopt teacher tenure reform.
What this means is that rather than allowing individuals to stay as teachers unless they commit a grievous offense, they ought to be able to be removed simply because of poor analytics, part metrics, which demonstrate that they are not teaching their children effectively.
We will allow school districts to determine whether a a teacher is failing rather than simply making the federal government use metrics on a test but generally, students will be evaluated at the beginning and end of the year to determine if they've truly learned things in a teacher's classroom providing greater autonomy and choice to school districts as a whole.
We have two arguments for why this is a good thing.
First, better teachers will be rewarded.
In the status quo, elderly teachers are able to keep their job simply because they have been in the school district for a long time.
This can be they can retain their position for one of two reasons.
Either first, they were able to get in at a time of prosperity.
Many teachers who were able to get their jobs in the eighties and nineties as cities were booming and school schools were being built were not really good teachers.
Because there was such a high demand for teachers at these times they were able to get their job and stay in their job despite being terrible teachers right from the beginning.
The other kind of teacher who is problematic are those teachers who were once good but as they got older and complacent they understood they didn't need to work as hard and as such, their students suffered.
We would say that reforming teacher tenure will fix both of these problems.
First, the teachers who were never good, who were able to get their jobs in the time of prosperity will simply be removed from their positions outright.
Because they're going to be unable to reform themselves, we would say that they will removed from their positions unless they truly rework themselves and revamp themselves to be better educators.
Those teachers who were once good will then get the greater incentive to continue being good to continue working hard on behalf of their students to teach effectively.
This is incredibly important for two reasons.
First, we think that students ought be able to have the best education possible.
The role of the school system is to ensure that individuals can take on the world, can essentially follow whatever path they see fit based on the education given to them.
Failing at early levels, particularly k through twelve, typically puts individuals on a path towards failure.
Additionally, this'll be effective because it will allow new teachers to get into the workforce overall.
In the status quo, if there are too many old teachers, new teachers cannot break in at all.
We would say that new teachers being in the workforce is generally good simply because they bring new ideas and new strategies.
Having it so teacher tenure reform is removed and bad teachers can be removed outright, will allow new teachers to break into the system and teach more effectively.
Now my second argument is about better unions.
We would say that the current major issue that unions fight for is teacher tenure.
They refuse outright to negotiate with individuals who want to remove teacher tenure.
What this means is that they typically do not focus on other issues similarly, elderly individuals within the unions, those who know that their jobs are completely protected, refuse to engage with any other policy because they know that their job is safe.
This creates antagonism on both sides, the union side and the employer side.
Would say that removing teacher tenure reform from the table is far more likely to create greater push for policies like increased teacher salary, increased resources for teachers and better curriculum control on behalf of teachers increasing education throughout the country far more effectively than teaching keeping teacher tenure.
For this reason, I am so proud to support this motion."
"We should ban algorithmic trading.
So, by this we mean stock purchase orders which are broken down into many small steps rather than executed all at once.
So, algorithmic trading might focus on particular metrics in the market and use them to purchase one part of an order and then wait until another metric is met to fulfill another part of the order until eventually, the entire thing is completed and this is all done by computer.
So, two arguments for you: the first is that this encourages risky behavior by investors.
So, algorithmic trading disassociates the order from the outcome.
It makes it more difficult for human investors to recognize the connection between the orders they place and any harmful outcomes or positive outcomes that they might receive.
We think that any one step is more likely to be blamed rather than the original intent.
So, in other words, if I were to execute a very complicated algorithmic trade and it broke down at some point and I lost a lot of money, I would very likely be angry about the one section of the trade that broke down rather than step back and think that my entire order might have been ill-conceived in the first place if the computer wasn't able to carry it out.
We think that people are likely, therefore, to take more risk because they won't associate the outcomes with the actions that they're actually taking.
And it's not to say that risk is bad.
Obviously, the market requires risk to function and no one will be able to raise capital without it, but ill-considered risk is certainly a bad thing.
The kind of risk taking that you want to see in a market is carefully calculated, where people think that the return is going to be worth their risk and where people are thinking about the outcomes of their actions in a very considerate way.
But when you break down this consideration because there's such a long chain of events between the purchase order and the outcome, we think you're going to get ill-considered risk that will actually make investing worse for everyone.
We think, furthermore, that people are likely to miss the forest for the trees while they're investing.
In other words, if you're focused on a handful of metrics in the market when you're trying to decide whether or not to invest, you may be more likely to miss larger trends in the market overall.
We think that this is going to be harmful because there will be unforeseen outcomes as investors focus too much on a handful of arbitrary metrics that can never possibly capture the entire scope of the market and everything that's going on.
A more old-fashioned approach to trading, where people consider a multitude of factors rather than a handful of algorithms and individual markers for the health of the market, would probably lead to more well-balanced outcomes because it's more all-inclusive.
So, therefore, we think that the if we don't ban algorithmic trading, you condemn investors to a sort of general short-sightedness where they're only looking at this outcome or this algorithm today or tomorrow and not thinking about the how their portfolio is going to look ten, twenty years down the line.
Our second argument is that algorithmic trading blocks out small traders.
So, there's obviously a large competitive advantage for traders that are of a such a scope that they're able to use algorithmic trading.
If you're a very powerful investment broker and things like that, you're probably going to have access to this technology, but we think that a lot of ordinary people or community pensions and things like that might not actually have access to this.
So, we think that this entrenches an existing competitive advantage where if you want to invest or if you want a pension fund to invest and things like that, you have to rely on one of a handful of large brokers who can actually afford to have all the tools to manage your account and that gives a lot of power to a handful of people.
And we think that for small investors who do try to stay in the market, they're going to be victims to a sort of invisible manipulation where, because they don't have access to this algorithmic trading, they're not going to be able to recognize the small changes in the market that are due to this algorithmic trading.
So, we think that the effect is that there's going to be a different level of access to information because of this practice, that it will actually harm small investors.
We also tell you that the trading market consolidate because of this, that because this technology gives you an incentive to always put your money in the hands of the largest investors who use this technology, this will reinforce control of the market by a handful of banks that have been very powerful for a long time which tend to be controlled by wealthy white men and entrenches a lot of privilege in the market.
So, for these reasons, we should ban algorithmic trading."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should disband amnesty international.
What we mean by this is that amnesty international would choose to disband itself and would stop existing as an organization that goes and like does international work.
Two main areas of clash, first on why it enforces a western ideology and why that is incredibly problematic.
Recognize that it's not the case that the western iteration of democracy is the perfect implementation.
We prefer countries and people to self determine as long as they aren't openly preventing some citizens from participating in the democratic process like we want them to have a democracy but we think that that democracy ought be in the iteration that they prefer and that the associated justice systems ought be in the iteration that they prefer ie it's not the case that having a multi like a two-party system is the best case scenario and we see that like groups like england may have a completely different system that also works.
The problem is that we don't allow that same kind of space for budding democracies and so we think what often happens is that amnesty international jumps the gun and goes into countries that are trying to form their own opinions and enforces the western iteration which angers the people within them but is also just like philosophically problematic and we think a really good example of this is like is like like we see that like in the united states the solitary confinement is like an accepted form of punishment eventhough it is incredibly dehumanizing and incredibly psychologically damaging and oftentimes other countries have this ban like even like and like some that we might like look down upon often.
The problem then is the US looks down on countries like iran for going by sharia law eventhough it is something that is like might be arguably less inhumane than locking someone away in a dark box for days on end.
We think the problem is that the amnesty international has a really particular way of seeing the justice system but it's not the case of the justice system has to be like homogenous across nations it's just a case that has to be consensual across nations.
So as long as I'm consenting into the justice system of the united states and the people in iran are consenting into the justice system by iran that's all that should matter.
This reagionality is necessary because different judicial bodies govern different areas and those people have different preferences so we allow for that kind of maneuverability and individuality when we let these groups take on their own justice systems.
But amnesty international takes a homogeneous a homogeneous look at justice and lobbies countries that derivate from the line that they draw.
We saw the pretty good example of this in iran in two thousand nine when amnesty international threw up a fit after after a man was found guilty for throwing acid in a woman's face and it was agreed that she could do the same to him.
We think that given this was a completely legitimate case like their justice system operating in the way that it should it's a problem that amnesty international saw fit to intervene and that's actually like quite a throwback to imperial powers so as such we think it's bad.
But second we think that amnesty international creates unnecessary conflict.
Public naming and shaming their main method isn't effective because it provides states with two options: either they capitulate with western organizations which they often don't like to do because it's seen as being weak and they don't want their populace to withdraw support but or they get to continue being shitty.
They oftentimes need to choose the latter because they don't want to look powerless to their populations and it's much more likely that actual compromise with international bodies would have worked or some kind of reasoning but now you've completely closed up that avenue because any kind of giving any kind of step in the in progress would be seen as that country giving in.
We think the absence of anything is preferable because you don't want problematic regimes to crunch down harder because of groups like amnesty international especially since they usually hit against the people that we were trying to protect in the first place.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should legalize public nudity.
First, I want to establish what this world looks like, because opp is going to get up here and they're going to &lt;unintelligible&gt; these arguments, and they're going to say that suddenly, on government's world, everyone is naked all the time, you have people completely nude on subways and in business meetings, etcetera.
But clearly this isn't the case.
What this round is isn't about completely creating a world in which everyone is always naked.
Rather it's about giving people options to be always naked if they so please, or it's more specifically to be able to strip certain layers off or be partially naked if that's what they want.
Because it's really unlikely that suddenly everyone will always be naked.
Like, recognize that weather still exists, like personal standards still exist.
It's oftentimes just uncomfortable to have your genitalia hanging out.
It's much more likely that when convenient, people can be less covered, ie, when it's really, really hot days in a granite-covered city or on beaches.
With that, two areas of clash.
First, I think we need to talk about human rights, because as a democracy, we generally strive to be the most free and as free as possible, because we recognize that even if governmentally something isn't incentivized, we do value that every individual can do as much as much things like in a more free way as they want.
So, there are generally two reasons that the government can ban something: either they have a pertinent government interest, ie, there's something like very economically special or like something very innovative about something, or there are external harms, like other people are harmed by this.
But public nudity doesn't actually go into either, right?
Like the government shouldn't care what you do or don't wear.
In fact, when they do, it's usually rebuffed really, really quickly by the systems, right?
We've already seen in situations in france where there were burqa bans.
People got really angry about this, especially in the united states, and made sure that this isn't something that could happen again.
Or when you had situations where people would try to regulate clothing in public spaces, such as like political speech in schools on your shirts, we also see that there were massive protests against this that requested that the government not allow anyone interfere with what these people are wearing.
And we think that this really does apply to like not wearing much clothes either.
We also don't think that anyone there are any external harm by other people nudity, right?
Like, at most, people might feel uncomfortable but let's discuss that, right?
This doesn't have legal standing in court, because people can be made uncomfortable by literally anything, and you can't legislate all of that.
Like, we're really diverse group of people, and I might be made uncomfortable by people being naked and someone else might be made uncomfortable by people whistling in public, like we can't regulate all of these things, and so we have to apply we have to rely on individual rights first.
We also think that in the end if you are uncomfortable with nudity, you can just look away.
And we also think that in the end, what you have is a brief moment of discomfort for someone, but a long-term discomfort for the person who can never dress the way that they desire.
Our second area of clash is about destigmatizing and deobjectifying the human body.
There's no good reason for humans to be uncomfortable with the with human nudity.
There's no physical threat to it.
It's literally just because society trained people to be weirded out by others who are naked.
The only way that you can break that cycle is by no longer reinforcing it by repeatedly telling people that you have to be dressed and covered at all times.
If we normalize nudity in society, people will stop feeling uncomfortable around it.
We also think that deobjectifying women also occurs on our side of the house.
Part of the reason we see women as objects is because oftentimes the only context in which we see them naked is in a sexual way.
Seeing more of them nonsexually deobjectifies their bodies and means we have less "" asking for "" stories.
Like, if more people in society are showing their bodies more frequently, there's a lot less of, "" well, she was dressed in a specific way.
She should have been dressed in a different way. ""
We also think that it destigmatizes things like fat and cellulite.
We're bombarded with perfect imagery of nude bodies, but now we'll see that in the reality, the majority of people aren't perfect.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should adopt the metric system and since there's only one country in the world so hard headed as not to have done this or one prominent country anyway, I'm going to assume this debate is about the united states.
So we have two main arguments about why america needs to adopt the metric system.
The first is that it's easier to use and I'll talk about why that's important and the second is about how this facilitates international cooperation and why that's important.
So why is it important that the metric system is easier to use?
Which is just obviously true if you've ever had to try to remember how many feet are in a mile versus how many meters are in a kilometer.
First of all, it'll be much easier for pupils to actually learn to use measurements in their everyday lives with the metric system.
I remember learning about the american units of measurement in every grade from first to about eighth which means that it probably takes students until they're like ten to thirteen, depending on how quickly they catch on, to be able to use the system effectively and I would estimate from my own experience that most adults even quite bright people forget about half of that information.
So they remember like inches and feet but a lot of adults cannot tell you how many feet are in a mile or how many pounds are in a ton which makes the whole system pointless because people are just going with their gut and don't actually know how long or how big a unit is and it kind of breaks down for its point of use.
No one is going to forget how many meters are in a kilometer.
Once you've learned it's kilo means one thousand it's just very obvious and it's never going to be a problem again and everyone will know there's a thousand meters in a kilometer and I know how big a meter is so I know roughly how big a kilometer is and hopefully if they run also they'll pick that up.
But anyway we think that this means that people will be more accurate with their measurements and that people will have a better understanding of things that are measured around them which will make things like scientific information more accessible to the public but also just let people make more informed decisions about travel.
Oftentimes I'll talk to people who don't know how long it'll take them to walk three miles because they actually just don't know how far a mile is and they're more used to driving.
I think that because a kilometer is just a simpler unit, that people will be better able to use these measurements in their everyday lives and for the record, it takes about an hour to walk three miles.
Secondly, we'd like to talk about international cooperation.
There have been many cases when american companies had large projects have major setbacks because they had an international contractor and failed to adapt the measurements.
When you're doing business as an american company abroad you're having to convert everything from the customary units that you're american engineers use to the metric system that foreign engineers use.
My grandfather worked at a engineering company that designed oil rigs and they often had a problem with this where american engineers would receive schematics from a foreign office and look at them and say "" this can't be right have them redo it "" because the conversions hadn't been done properly and they were like well this is too small or this is too big based on what we think this would be in the standard system.
So you can see that there's actually a huge opportunity cost to doing this and the other side might say "" look this isn't a problem all the time "". ""
The united states cooperates with the rest of the world often "" but it does so by using the metric system right?
The only way that america can fully cooperate in science is that we use the metric system in science and the same is true for medicine.
When we build international infrastructure projects we have to use the metric system.
When we send things into space we use the metric system.
So we may as well just adopt it in general so that we don't have to go to these extra lengths and still have setbacks because people in america just don't have a good feel for the metric system.
Like I don't really know how big a centimeter is the way I instinctively know how big an inch is.
Or maybe that's a bad example, but a kilogram I have no idea how big that is compared to a pound.
So you can see that even well educated americans are suffering because of this and for all of these reasons, we should adopt the metric system.
Thank you."
"We should introduce universal healthcare.
We're going to present two main arguments in this debate.
The first is about rights and why universal healthcare would fulfill the right to healthcare that people have and secondly about the economic benefits that would come from universal health care.
So firstly on rights.
We would say that health is a necessary right to access any right that you can conceive of that you think is valuable.
Whether it's the right to free mobility, the right to bodily autonomy, the right to life, all these things require a bare minimum level of health for people to access those types of things.
We think that rights shouldn't be available and attainable only based on class alone.
But in the status quo, this is the case.
If you are too poor to afford health insurance, but too rich to be on medicaid, or if you're in a country that doesn't have such social make safety nets, we think that what currently exists is a system in which it is not possible and not feasible for you to access the basic right of average, standard health.
And while some people would say they don't want to have a health care system, they don't want to get insurance, it's simply the case and it is a fact that all people, or almost all people, will need to access health insurance and health care at some point in their life.
And those that are less likely to get insurance in the short term are those that are in the long term most likely to be harmed because of that lack of insurance, because suddenly they get some sort of disease and insurers are unwilling to cover them at the point at which they need to to have those costs covered by an insurance company, because healthcare as it currently stands is incredibly expensive.
We don't think that economic class should dictate whether or not you are able to live a healthy life and we think that it is simply the case that by providing insurance through the government, by providing universal healthcare, you're more likely to provide quality and expansive care.
The reason for this is that insurance companies currently can provide low quality care because insurance companies are often the only providers or one of very few providers in any given area.
What you have in the united states government though is a system that is accountable to the voters.
If you provide sub-par healthcare to individuals they will know because health care is a very important political topic, and they will vote you out of office because you have a real negative impact on their lives and voters are unafraid to speak their minds.
We think that you're more likely to get quality access to the right of health care if it's run by the government through universal health care system.
So secondly, on the economy and why you we think you get cheaper healthcare in the long run.
Firstly, we think that single payer healthcare increases the collective bargaining power by shifting the ability to bargain with hospitals and pharmaceutical companies and other types of healthcare providers all into the hands of the government.
It means that the entire government was capable of lobbying and bargaining for the with the power of the entire population of any state with insurance with health care coverage providers.
What this means is that you have more capability to flex your strength, your more capability of shifting your assets and shifting your your your money and other types of funds to other areas and it makes it more likely that healthcare providers will cowtail to what you need demanded.
Furthermore, uninsured end up getting healthcare in the status quo.
If you're uninsured and you go to a hospital you'll get treated and when you can't afford to pay that bill that bill is then passed on to the american taxpayer.
So just because we're covering all people doesn't mean that in the status quo all people don't defacto get covered by the US government and finally we think insurance is a non productive use of assets.
We think that given that insurance is not an innovative industry it doesn't produce anything that can then be sold in a meaningful free market, we think that it is better to leave this type of care, insurance type of care, to the government, a nonproductive entity, and allow private funds to be diverted into more productive resources.
For these reasons we should introduce universal healthcare."
"We should legalize cell phone use while driving.
So in this debate what we're going to tell you is that it would be better to legalize and regulate cell phone use rather than have a categorical ban.
We see that many districts, such as the state of new york in america, have a categorical ban on any cell phone use while driving.
We think that ultimately there are many reasons why that's undesirable and why regulated cell phone use would be preferable.
Three arguments.
The first is that these bands don't reflect the current state of technology.
Today with the rise of smartphones and phones being integrated into cars, we think that people are able to use phones much more safely than they could in two thousand or two thousand two when these laws are being put into place.
We think that with that in mind, we should regulate such that people are allowed to use things like apple in their cars, or android for cars, but aren't allowed to use things like traditional cell phones which are much more dangerous.
We think that it's important the law reflect changes to technology and that ultimately a categorical band lacks the flexibility to adapt in this way.
Our second argument is that we allow other distractions and that we ought be principally consistent.
So on our side we tell you that while it's true that we wouldn't allow people to text, there are many other uses for the phone that are less distracting.
For instance, you can have a conversation on the phone with no more distraction that having a conversation with the passenger.
At the end of the day the other side needs to explain to you why we're okay with allowing people to do things like listen to music, or talk to another person, but why we categorically ban talking on the phone.
We don't think they'll be able to do so.
We think that this is principally inconsistent.
Why is this a problem?
People follow the law when they think the law is fair and just.
We tell you that when law seem arbitrary and stupid, that people are much more likely to disregard them even when the laws are actually good.
In other words, when you have a ban on talking on the phone and citizens realize that this band is effectively a nanny state overstepping its bounds to ban something that's not actually dangerous, then they're less likely to respect other regulations because they now associate the state with this kind of overprotective mother figure.
We think that this is a particularly egregious example of such a nanny state because so many adults drive and almost all of them talk on the phone while they do so.
At that point we would prefer a world in which it's regulated intelligently so that people can respect the law and follow it more easily.
Our last argument is that ultimately we think that this is an unenforceable ban.
What do we mean by this?
The only way to catch people who are using their phones while driving, is if they are caught committing another crime.
So if you're speeding and the police officer sees you have your phone out when they pull you over or something like that.
What this means is that this could only ever be prosecuted as an additional crime to something else.
It's an auxiliary.
We think that it's impossible to ever actually catch all the people using their phones and that people know this.
What this means is that people flaunt the law which leads into everything I just told you about how they have less respect for it, but also we think that in general, the law shouldn't be so such so difficult to enforce.
We think that we should focus on regulations that officers can actually catch people breaking and that we can actually prosecute people for.
Having useless laws on the books just means that they will be applied in instances when they probably aren't appropriate such as if a prosecutor wants to get someone for drunk driving and doesn't have the evidence instead, they'll go after them for using their phone.
We think that it won't be prosecuted on its own but rather that it will be a crutch for lazy prosecution.
So at the end of the day we think that although clearly it's not ideal for people to be distracted by their phone while driving, that ultimately the risk is decreased due to technological changes, that it's principally no different than talking to a passenger, and that the ban is unenforceable.
For these reasons, I encourage you to support legalizing cell phone use while driving.
Thank you."
"We should legalize cell phone use while driving.
To be clear in this debate, when we're talking about cell phone use, we think we're talking primarily about talking on the phone, maybe briefly looking at the phone to navigate, do these types of things.
We're not going to say that we would allow texting, we think it's just been demonstrably shown that texting increases the rates of accidents, and we think that there's still a robust debate to be had in other areas.
So, why do we think that we should legalize using your cell phone while driving?
So firstly, we would say that there's not a meaningful difference between talking to someone on your phone, or talking to someone over the phone, as there is with having someone in the car with you.
In fact, we think it's much more likely that, when someone is in the car with you, you're likely to have an accident.
The person in the car could try and show you something, you're more likely to divert your attention from the road to the person sitting next to you, than you are if you're simply talking to someone on the phone, because there's no one to look at when they're not in the car with you.
So we think that, given that we allow people to be in the car with other people, that we allow drivers to communicate with their passengers in the car freely, and there's no real check on that, we see no reason why someone being able to talk to someone on their cell phone would have a tangible harm.
Some may say that, you may not be able to you may not have to hands on the wheel, but firstly, you can clearly talk to someone on the cellphone, while also having two two hands on the wheel, you can put your speaker on, you can use a bluetooth headphones.
So, we think that argument is irrelevant, but also let's be honest, most people don't constantly drive with two hands on the wheel, so we think that this isn't a meaningfully greater distraction, than when people are on the phone, or when people are talking to other people, and so we think that this is a reasonable stance to take.
We also think that, the ban in the status quo is used problematically, in the sense that we think that the large motivation, for making cell phone use while driving illegal in the status quo, is simply to collect tax revenue from individuals, so that police officers can call individuals over and give them a fine, and that this is a way that the state raises revenue, and in fact ticketing individuals is a massive source of state revenue, especially in urban areas, and we think that this is just dramatically unjust.
It means that people can be targeted and pay a disproportionate amount to society, in the form of taxes, simply because they're doing something that is irrationally illegal, that has no tangible harms that can be demonstrated with it.
So given that this is the case, we think that it simply forms an unjust an unjust way of taxing individuals, and that without this, we think that other reforms we need to be would need to be made to raise the same amount of revenue, but that those forms would ultimately and more likely be fair.
So we think that, and finally, we think that people should simply have the freedom to communicate.
We think that there are really reasonable reasons that people would want to talk on their cell phone, while they're driving.
Maybe someone has an emergency, and they need to contact an individual, or someone else is having an emergency needs to contact them, maybe they're simply trying to make plans, and they're trying to figure out where they're going to go, or what they're going to do with the people when they get there, and yes this is kind of an aesthetic, or a kind of ethereal thing, but these are the way that people construct their lives, and construct their plans, and make plans for the future, and without the ability to do this, we think that it's simply limits their ability to function meaningfully in the world.
We also think that, sometimes people need to stay awake at night, and that people talk to people on the phone as a meaningful way to keep them energized, and keep them awake, in a time when they may be incredibly tired.
So, all of these are just feasible reasons why people may want to be on the phone while driving, and given that, people are able to be in the car with other individuals, are able to talk with other individuals, regardless.
We don't think that the introduction of the cell phone is a meaningful harm, that is added on to these people, and so if we're going to give drivers the freedom to talk with passengers in the car, for any number of reasons, we think that the same freedom should be given to talk to people on the phone, to use their phone for brief periods of time.
And given all of this, we say that we should legalize cell phone use while driving."
"We should abolish juvenile courts.
Our model for this is fairly simple.
We think we should formalize a set of rules as to what happens to minors who commit crimes based on the type of crimes.
So essentially we would say that anything that is lower than like first degree murder of multiple people, we would say it doesn't actually have any kind of jail sentence rather you would just maybe keep that person under surveillance, you'd have them check in with the parole officer regularly whereas crimes that are above that intensities of first degree murder and above would be just send you to regular adult jail if you're found guilty.
And we think that in this way we can maintain punishment for individuals who are doing really egregious things but we can still have some degree of separation between children and adults when it comes to the way that they are treated by the courts.
Two main arguments, first on preventing cycles of recidivism.
The problem with juvenile courts is that they are really bad at distinguishing themselves functionally in their impact from adult courts, because you have kids who are basically adults like seventeen and eighteen year olds and you also have kids who are actually kids like ten year olds a twelve year olds and they all kind of get pushed into the same system.
And then what happens then is that you have these interactions between people who might have committed much lower level crimes or who are much younger with people committed higher level crimes and are much older.
And this builds these kinds of criminal networks that we hear about all the time in prisons like when they have gangs and that people are more likely to be involved in criminal activity after they get out than they were before because of the connections that they make and because of the influences that these people now have over their lives.
And we think like sure they siphon kids to different prisons but the impact on the kid is still really similar in terms of the psychology as the impact on an adult or like a young adult is when they go to regular prison.
You're still going to have judges who pass down harsh sentences that often put kids in communities where every stimulus around them will push them back into that criminal system which we just think isn't the goal when someone is that young.
Like we think that they're written infinitely more options for redemption when you're dealing with children than when you're dealing with adults.
These are people who haven't fully formed their conception of the world, who haven't created their social networks yet.
People who can really be sent down a different road if they are treated properly and we think that we need to explore options that can actually rehabilitate them outside of the prison system rather than just sending them into that pipeline right away.
We also just think that the answer to a lot of these issues is to stop reinforcing those behaviors and putting them into those communities.
Instead you should work to give kids another chance by not isolating them from society and putting them in a box with a bunch of other criminals.
Moreover we think that the reasons that people commit crimes as children tend to actually be quite similar to adults.
So we think they shouldn't be punished in order to try and prevent the bad cycles that prison starts, but if they're committing like truly awful crimes like first degree murder and above, then they should probably end up going to jail and being punished the same way as adults and their age doesn't actually change the severity of their crimes.
Obviously we can have some case by case control like if a ten year old ends up going on a murder spree we think there can be some court leniency there and some like maybe we want to separate them a little bit differently if they don't go into the prison population things like that.
But in general we think it is a good guiding principle to abolish the juvie system and kind of operate more in the confines of maybe we won't send them to jail at all or we will send them to jail the same way that an adult would.
Our second argument is about cutting bureaucratic costs.
Juvie is just a redundant system that costs the same as the original, so you're just paying twice to have essentially the same thing occur.
It costs the same as adult court but accomplishes nothing that adult court court couldn't accomplish and insofar as we don't really need it, we just think you might as well get rid of it and cut those costs down and maybe use that money in other ways like use that money to build real rehab programs and like put therapy into prisons and do things that might be able to cut that recidivism rate down and things like that.
Proud to propose."
"We should further exploit clean energy sustainable energy because it's a matter of life and death and if that's not enough, if death isn't a good enough reason, it's also a good economic reason which for anyone who doesn't think you're going to die then you probably care about money so there's that.
So let's start by talking about why this is necessarily true.
And this is true because fossil fuels are one of the leading contributors to global warming.
And this is because fossil fuels have incredibly wide ranging demand and also application.
Whether you like want like basic cooling or refrigeration or heating or cooking or transportation like almost everything requires energy.
So obviously energy is important, we all know that.
But energy goes into a whole lot of things too.
Like if you're like trying to make plastics which like make almost any kind of supply, you're probably using oil cause oil is a big ingredient in plastics.
That factory is also running off of electricity, the trucks that are delivering those goods run on electricity, when your car goes to the store that is stores running on electricity and you have to use it to run your car.
Maybe you're going to plug in whatever you buy into an outlet or something or it's going to connect to the internet or whatever.
Obviously energy is everywhere and incredibly important.
So if we could make that cheaper, better, and more environmentally friendly then you're solving a whole lot of problems.
So how are we going to do this?
Well for starters, eventually you're going to run out of a lot of these non renewable resources.
Oil reserves are going to dry up, all of the coal all of the coal is already going to be mined and these things are going to be all problems.
We already see this start to unfold where we're constantly going to new locations to find oil, we're going to like deeper levels of like getting oil, we're getting oil from like new places, extracting it from rocks instead of just like drilling into the ground or all kinds of different ways in which we have to get oil or whatever.
And as this gets like progressively and progressively harder to find these non renewable resources, it's only going to get more expensive and that's like like like independent of the impacts it has in the environment, the fact that it contributes to climate change which makes it so that it's harder to grow food because weather is more extreme and crops only grow at certain temperatures, makes it harder that like city it makes it like more likely that cities will flood because see levels will rise and because of other kinds of natural disasters from like forty year rain events that happen every couple of years like what we saw in texas and puerto rico and other kinds of places like that.
So obviously those are already good consequences.
There's also the economic consequences where in the long run, as like a long term investment, sustainable energy is just going to be better.
Because rather than constantly having to like drill for more oil or mine more coal, you're just going to have a solar panel that's going to get energy from the sun and the sun is always out.
Or sun's always contributing energy even if it's not out per se.
Or if the sun isn't out it's probably windy or cloudy and or you're probably by like an ocean or some kind of river or water so you can adopt like wind turbines or hydroelectric power something like that.
Even nuclear energy could probably be considered sustainable in the sense that it's very very much sustainable and it in a lot of ways functions and non renewable resource because you're probably not going to run out of it really ever.
All of these would be like much better alternatives.
They can oftentimes be in the long term will probably be cheaper both with economies of scale further research and development things like that.
And it's also going to just make it so that people are going to have cheaper supplies of energy in the long run which is just good for the economy because like I was saying, since energy goes into everything from transportation to like shipping to like consumption to cooling to heating and whatever, when energy's cheaper everything about life is cheaper.
So for all those reasons invest and further exploit sustainable energy."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should adopt vegetarianism.
What we model this by as that it would be a better world if the vast majority of individuals were vegetarians.
Two main areas of clash, first on stopping animal abuse.
Factory farming, the way the majority of people get their meat, is incredibly abusive both to the people who work there and the animals within them.
Animals are incredibly are put into incredibly small overcrowded spaces, they're underfed, over medicated and not allowed to range as they naturally would where they are living in the wild, or even see the sun in a lot of situations.
You don't have to buy that animals are equal to humans.
You just have to buy that they deserve to not spend their life in eternal suffering.
Recognize that there is an interaction of higher order pain versus lower order pleasure.
Humans have nothing to lose from not eating meat.
You can still have perfectly fulfilling diets, be healthy, have communal dinners etcetera.
Meanwhile, animals go through the ultimate form of suffering as they are bred for slaughter in the most painful ways possible.
We think that animals experience suffering in a similar pattern to humans in that it is something that they can recognize coming and something that they massively avoid.
This is why we'd say the most humane way to kill an animal used to shoot them from the back into a point of the body that would kill them instantly, because in that way they do not foresee the shot coming and also do not suffer from it happening.
We think the problem in the status quo is that animals are put through like intense amounts of suffering up the point of death as well as in death.
Which is necessarily rights violative for the few rights that they would have.
Our second area of clash is about environmental benefits.
Recognize that a large portion of emissions comes from methane produced by animals.
You need to decrease those emissions in order to decrease the amount by which our atmosphere increases in temperature.
So we actually think a really effective way to regulate those emissions is by getting rid of the animals that create them.
But also, recognize that animals take up much more water than the same land area of fruits or vegetables.
This is because you work for, in order to it grow a farm you first have to grow the food that they are going to consume.
So a lot of cattle and a lot of animals that are like used, eaten by humans are grain fed or corn fed.
And this means that acres upon acres of land are wasted and used incredibly inefficiently in that they are planted with crops that humans will never eat but rather the water that is used there and the crops that are grown are directly provided to animals.
Then as the animals grow up on that food, they also require their own drinking water which on net results in a lot of waste.
And we think that in a world where we are massively experiencing huge amounts of droughts, where individual areas find themselves strapped for water and having to pay exorbitant prices for it, where groups like flint michigan still can't get clean water to drink without having to purchase bottled water, we cannot afford to waste that on livestock that is just going to be killed.
We also tell you that they require much more grazing land and contribute to the loss of topsoil because the roots of trees and plants that keep that soil in place get strapped by the animals that are like eating grass off of there.
So like you have entire mountainsides that can no longer ever be grown anything on, or like planes that can never have anything grown on them because of the fact that they have been over grazed to the point where the mineral content is gone in their topsoil is completely stripped.
Our third area of clash is just about general harms that occur with these kinds of farms.
Recognize these tend to be be worse for the quality of control for like human human working there as well.
Like a lot of the times these have very low pay, they employ mass amounts of illegal immigrants so that their abuses against animals don't get reported, and in and in doing so they under pay these people and under provide for them.
They make them work for really harsh chemicals and all of this is also human rights violative and is associated with the industry.
So we actually think we would prefer that entire industry not to exist and this would only be eliminated if the demand for animal meat didn't exist.
So we prefer a world in which people are vegetarians.
Proud to propose."
"We should end water fluoridation.
So water fluoridation is a process by which fluoride is added to the water so that people will be less likely to get dental cavities.
The idea is that by introducing fluoride into people's diet, ultimately their teeth will be healthier and less likely to decay over time.
In many countries fluoride is added to the public water at a central plant before it's distributed to people's houses.
In this way people don't really have a choice about whether they want fluoride in their water.
It's just automatically put there on their behalf.
We're not going to argue that fluoride is fundamentally unsafe.
We think that it's been well proven in the states and in europe that it is but we're going to make a few arguments for why it shouldn't be put in the tap water.
Our first argument is that people don't have any choice about whether or not they get fluoride in their tap water.
For most people, the tap is the source of all of their drinking water, at least in countries that are developed enough to offer fluoride.
Presumably in countries like turkey where people don't normally drink the water, there's no point in adding fluoride.
But with that in mind we tell you that people should have a reasonable expectation to pure drinking water.
It may be true that some people want fluoride but other people may not.
I'm not saying that this is a well informed choice.
Those people are probably ill informed or making a poor decision by choosing not to want fluoride, but we still think that that choice ought belong to those people.
At the end of the day we let people make stupid decisions all the time.
If people can drink coca cola even though it rots your teeth, we don't see why they should be forced to have chemicals in their water.
We think that ultimately people who want fluoride are likely to get it from brushing their teeth, more on that in just a minute, and so people who don't want it should be allowed to make a choice about whether or not they want to consume it.
At the end of the day even if we think this is a stupid choice, we shouldn't prevent people from making their own decisions just because we disagree with them.
In liberal democracies and other highly developed countries we ought instead defer to letting people make their own decisions even when there's some drawbacks such as a higher risk of cavities.
Our second argument is that there isn't much need for water fluoridation anymore nowadays.
This used to be much more important back before people brush their teeth as often or with as high a quality of toothpaste.
Nowadays if you go and buy toothpaste, your crest or your colgate or whatever is popular in your country from the pharmacist, that toothpaste has fluoride in it.
And all of the benefits that you get from water fluoridation are also accessed by brushing your teeth with fluoride toothpaste.
Basically you just need some exposure every day.
There's no benefit to drinking a few liters of fluoridated water as opposed to brushing your teeth with fluoridated toothpaste.
And since people are already doing that we think that it's superfluous to go ahead and put fluoride in the water.
More on that in just a moment.
But we think that also in regards to what we said earlier about choice, if people want to choose to use a fluoride free toothpaste, again, that may be a poor decision, but it ultimately ought be their decision.
We should let people control what they put into their own bodies.
Our third and final argument is that this is a poor use of government funds.
So recognize that we've already shown you that people would be getting fluoride already whether or not it's in the water because it's in their toothpaste.
At that point the government is spending money every year on something that doesn't actually do any good.
So it may be true that this isn't massively expensive.
We're not going to tell you that the US is spending billions of dollars on fluoride.
It isn't.
But all government money is fungible.
So we think that this money could be better spent on other public health programs instead.
Things like improving water quality more broadly or improving rural access to safe drinking water, for instance, are a trade-off with fluoridation.
This money could be spent in those ways and would ultimately benefit people more greatly than what we see as a benefit of water fluoridation.
So for all of these reasons we think that we should end water fluoridation.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should subsidize public service broadcasters, we being the united states government.
Two main areas of clash, the first on accountability and the incentives of the government as compared to other large bodies.
Because recognize what the comparative is: if the government isn't funding these broadcasters, then large corporations or consumer-based tactics dominate broadcasting in television insofar as individual broadcasters have to be able to fund themselves.
So, let's explore why the government is better.
First, recognize that the government has much less reason to be partisan than any other corporation, because even if one political power party might be in power at that moment, many entities control the government at large and the bureaus.
So, even if our president is republican, even if we have a majority democratic congress, those who control other bureaus aren't necessarily less partisan.
But even if you don't buy that, we tell you that generally the government, as a whole, wants the public to be educated in order to make future good decisions.
Insofar as the government is created in order to serve the public will, they don't have an incentive to undermine it through propaganda, even if individual people within the government do.
But next we tell you that the accountability, if the government is being problematic, is much higher when the government is funding them rather than if large corporations are.
Because recognize that if like exxon corporation pays fox to say something nonsense or overly conservative that supports the oil industry, and then other people call fox out, then neither exxon nor fox particularly care about the fallout as long as their ratings aren't hurt.
But recognize that if the government was to fund NPR, and then NPR was to spew nonsense that was like inherently lies about the oil or gas industry, the government gets the fallout from those lies because now they're having people who are individually like, "" look, you were supposed to be a real news source, you were supposed to be nonpartisan. ""
But more than this, we tell you that independence to these news organizations is necessarily a positive thing.
Insofar as their funding is not tied to how many views they get, is not tied to how many donors donate to them, they are necessarily going to be much more likely to take nonpartisan stances, because they're not trying to gain more money, and they're necessarily going to be more educative, because they're not just trying to be clickbait.
What this means is that you're actually going to have real news coming out of these public service broadcasters as compared to other corporations, and you'll actually be able to trust them more.
Our second area of clash has to do with societal good.
First we want to talk about kids' television, because recognize that in the status quo, a lot of corporations do not fund children's television, insofar as kids don't make money and don't create large profits.
What this means is that either you simply don't get meaningful kids' television, or you get kids television that is full of advertisements for toys-r-us and other corporations.
What this means is that the best kind of television for children oftentimes comes out of things like PBS, where the incentive to make more money decreases the number of advertisements or at leaps at least keeps them minimized towards, like, goodwill funding, like they often advertise charities and other positive things.
But also, that these television shows, in themselves, are more education-based because they don't care if your child changes the channel, because their funding comes from the government, not from this like the television resource that like based on your clicks.
But next, we wanna talk about where they provide news, because people with more money can necessarily afford subscriptions to things like foreign policy and large news-based organizations that can provide them with the news they prefer to hear.
The issue is that while not everyone has the money to subscribe to a specific news outlet, most people have a television in this house in their house.
What this means is that those who can't afford specialized sources, can exclusively afford things that are subsidized by the government, such as public service broadcasters.
More than this though, we tell you that a lot of the news out there is incredibly partisan on television, such as fox news or NBC.
We tell you that a moderate voice provided to those who cannot afford it is incredibly important.
For those reasons, proud to propose."
"We should introduce year round schooling.
Right now, in the united states at least, primary and secondary school students tend to have a large break in the summertime when traditionally you would have had lots of work on the farm for them to do.
Most american students currently go to school for about thirty six weeks in the year.
We propose a system wherein students go to school for twelve weeks with one week break afterwards which would have them go to school for forty eight weeks in the year.
Three arguments for why this is better than what we have right now.
The first is that this would better facilitate student's learning.
During summer vacation students forget much of what they learned in the previous year.
This is harmful for a few reasons.
First of all, we tell you that students lose time at the beginning of the new school year reviewing material which they already have learned.
If students go home for the summer and forget the names of the elements or great british authors or whatever they learned the previous year, and they have to relearn them in the fall, then this is time that isn't spent learning new material.
On top of that we tell you that this facilitates learning because students are spending more time in the classroom.
The only way for students to learn material is to be exposed to it in the first place.
We tell you that by having forty eight weeks as opposed to thirty six of time with teachers the students will simply learn more material.
It doesn't matter if you want students to learn more stem, or to be better informed citizens, no matter what you think education should be doing for students, it can be done better with more time with teachers, with more time to learn.
And I'd also like to point out that particularly for low income students it's likely that they aren't using their time during the summer to better educate themselves.
They might be working or they might just be in child care not really doing anything productive.
So if students are in school year round it's likely that they are reading and doing experiments and other useful activities during the summer instead of playing with water guns with their friends which, while gratifying, probably doesn't do a great deal to prepare them for the work force or for college.
Our second argument is about how this helps parents.
Consider that if your children have a twelve week break in the summer you have to arrange childcare for that time.
Whereas when your children are in school, they are in a safe, productive environment for free.
During the summer you have to pay someone to look after your children if you work.
We think that this places an undue burden on low income parents in particular.
In other words, the families that can least afford to bear the cost of additional childcare are likely to be the ones in which both parents work.
So not only are these families now being forced to pay for childcare, but this is a burden that accrues disproportionately to those worst off in society.
We think that it would be far better to provide free childcare for those people.
At that point when we already have their children, probably in a school being supervised, we might as well be teaching them.
Moreover we think that these parents also are going to have their children on a system more like their own work schedule if their children go to school throughout the year.
Parents can choose to take time off of work when their children have their short breaks which allows them to spend more quality time with their children.
We tell you that at the end of the day this is better than having the children home for the summer without lots of time spent with their parents.
Our last argument is that this would lead to a better use of resources.
Consider that if children are at home during the summer, then schools are presumably sitting empty.
We think that this is a waste of the resources that we've invested in those schools, not to use them year round.
If we have to give them power and air and things like that, we might as well have children in them learning at the same time.
And lastly we tell you that this is a misuse of teacher's time.
That ultimately we would be better off having teachers spend more time teaching and less time working on other projects during the summer.
While no doubt these are of value to the individual teachers, we think that having more face to face time with children would ultimately allow teachers to do their job more effectively and place less of a burden on them during that thirty six week period that they had before.
For all these reasons we should introduce year round schooling.
Thank you."
"We should end development aid.
Development aid is money given by wealthy countries or institutions like the IMF and the world bank to poorer countries in order in theory to help them to develope from being relatively underdeveloped to eventually becoming fully developed countries.
Unfortunately we think that oftentimes this money is given with a lot of strings attached that actually make it harder for those countries to develop.
So our first argument is going to be about how this fosters dependence on development aid.
When countries receive lots of development aid, oftentimes it becomes a major part of their government budget.
So these countries now rely on that development aid just for the way that their government ordinarily functions.
After all, when you have more money coming in spending increases that is after all the point of this aid but that means that if the money should ever go away that ultimately you're going to have to raise that money in another way whether by higher taxes or by lowering spending and that's very unlikely to be popular with your populace.
So this creates a system where governments are dependent on receiving development aid after they begun to receive it.
What does that do?
It let's institutions like the world bank or the IMF dictate to countries what they are going to do in the future and how to govern.
We think that this is problematic for a few reasons, one because it's undemocratic.
Nobody elects the bureaucrats who run the world bank.
They're appointed by the united states and a handful of european countries.
Secondly it's problematic because oftentimes these institutions don't really care about the well-being of people in these countries.
They want to maximize the benefits for the US and wealthy european countries because those are the countries that control the world bank and the IMF.
That's why the world bank and the IMF often tell countries to radically liberalize their economies, even if that means giving up the ability to exploit their own mineral rights or the ability to develop their own industries in favor of letting western companies come in and use their labor very cheaply.
It's true that some countries have implemented this with a certain amount of success.
India has become much wealthier in the last twenty years through market liberalization, but every country that is highly developed got there through a process of protectionism.
Countries like the US and south korea didn't have free trade during the period when they were developing most rapidly otherwise their industry would have been choked.
So we think that this is unlikely to lead to development and that because of the dependence that it fosters, countries are going to be unable to get away from these harmful policies in order to pursue something that would lead to good development.
Ultimately that's probably the biggest harm of this development aid.
But our second argument is that it's used to prop up bad governments.
In many cases, regimes or governments that would have been toppled by their people or ousted by some other faction are able to stay in power because of an influx of outside capital.
We think that ultimately when you have a very unpopular government that's supported by development aid, it's unlikely that people are going to be able to replace them.
This is true to an extent in south africa where, the government is fairly unpopular but receives lots of aid from the outside world.
They can use this aid to buy a certain amount of support or to prop themselves up.
Ultimately again this subverts democratic will within the country because even if people want a government with less corruption, they're not going to be able to get it as long as the international community is supporting the existing government.
We think that this is the real harm of development aid, is that even if it has good intentions behind it and I've already explained that often it doesn't, it will always subvert democratic will because it's money being sent by other countries in order to tell governments what they should and should not do.
This money always comes with strings attached in terms of how it's spent so people in that country lose control of their government policy.
Ultimately we don't think it's worth it.
For these reasons we should and development aid.
Thank you."
"We should subsidize student loans.
We mean by this is that we would prefer the government to allocate a certain amount of money within their budget to pay partially for the loans that students who go to higher education accrue.
We would be fine with incorporating this as part of the like a subsidization rate based on income or something similarly.
Three main areas of clash, first on why it is why it is good to encourage people to go to the to go to college.
I think recognize first and foremost that although we live in a world that has made grand steps into making college a more accessible activity through the use of things like of merit-based and financial need based aid we are still far away from achieving a world in which every student who prefers to is able to go to college.
Not just fiscaly.
Recognize that oftentimes financial based aid doesn't account for a fairly large fraction of students who are to have too much money to be to qualify for financial aid based on their income but don't have quite enough in order to cover college comfortably.
What this means is that these are often students who take out large amounts of loans but don't actually have anything to help them offset that cost but more than that there are also students who are simply scared away from going to college at all by the concept of having to take out loans or by the concept of exploring how expensive it is and we think that this is a combined optic and actually real harm in terms of how people feel going to college would would affect them fiscally.
We think that encouraging people to go to college is generally a good thing for a couple of reasons.
First recognize that we are vastly moving towards a world in which a college education is a prerequisite to any kind of job that will you pay will pay you more than above more than the minimum wage or enough to be actually livable.
And even jobs that don't technically require the skills that you acquire for college will still prioritize college graduates above someone who did not have a college degree.
But more than this, recognize that generally the boost in income that college will provide you even if it's the case that you would be able to find a job without a college degree, is usually significant enough that it would change the standard of living quite a bit for someone so we think that's also a good thing.
But finally we think that even if in the end of the day you're going to choose the same job that you would have received without a college degree the idea of having more options in a world where the job market tends to be unstable is always preferable to a world where it is not.
But second area of clash which is more related to this is why it is good for the economy.
Because recognize first that when you have more people attending college because they see the barrier to college as lower than that is good because these are people who will make more money when they when they have a job more money that they put back into the economy things like that but second and and this also interacts with the unemployment rate so we think that people who go to college and find jobs as opposed to individuals who don't go to college have a much larger employment rate that is definitely good for the economy but more than this recognize that once you are out of college if you have a large amount of loans there's a trade off between the amount of money that you have for non necessary goods compared to how much you have to spend on those loans.
We think it is always better for the economy if individuals spend their money on tradable goods or on other such like stimulative things that stimulate the economy instead of having to pay that money off in loans.
We also think that this generally makes people grow up a lot faster so we think that what happens on their side of the house a lot is that students who just graduated tend to move back in with their parents and take a little bit longer to become economically independent and we think that it is always better for the economy if individuals are fiscally independent.
But finally and third area of clash, recognize that college has become vastly a necessity and we think that in a world in which it has governments need to adjust to that and provide avenues for citizens to achieve a livable goal, not just bceause it is economically good but because it is fundamental to individuals.
Proud to propose."
"We should legalize sex selection.
At the beginning of this debate, it's important to recognize that the reasons that someone would choose to have an abortion because of the sex of their child, or would choose to, prior to being pregnant trying to select the sex of their child, the reasons for this are wide and varied, and we think that many of these are culturally dependent and built into the ways in which people have been raised over the course of their entire lives.
So recognizing it at the beginning in this debate, it's incredibly difficult to change the mentality that these people have, and to change the culture that drives people to having the sort of abortions or doing the sort of procedures.
So, that is crucial to recognize at the very start.
Given that that is the case, we think there are two reasons that you should legalize sex selection.
The first is about bodily autonomy, and the second is a bit about how the lives of these children if this isn't passed, or if this legislation or if this legalization doesn't happen, why the lives of children that are going to be born are going to be on net worse.
Okay.
Two things.
First, bodily autonomy.
We think that anyone that is pregnant has the right to abort that pregnancy at any given moment due to their claim to bodily autonomy.
We think that bodily autonomy is the most important right that an individual has, because it is the prior right to the access of any other rights.
What I mean by this is that in order to access your rights to freedom of speech, to mobility, to access to economic capital, any of these sorts of things, what is required prior to that is the right to bodily autonomy.
And we think that, because this individual is currently able to access that right and not only access that right, but because this individual compared to the fetus, has a much higher claim to that right, because they are a cognizant of the fact that their rights exist because they're able to act upon those rights because they have been afforded those rights for sometime, and because for for many reasons the fetus up to a point of viability simply cannot be weighed in the same sense as the mother can.
So we think that, for, we think that bodily autonomy is necessary to access all of these other rights and to force women to go through these births when they don't want to because of the gender of their child, is problematic.
But, from there it's important to think about what happens if these abortions or if these procedures are not allowed.
We think that what's likely to happen is that, two major things.
First, we think this child might be abandonned, which is , a horrible fate to happen to a child.
This can happen either if this child being forced into an orphanage or something like that into a state that is likely not very good, somewhere where they're unlikely to get the education and the sort of foundational building of their life that allows them to be successful in the future, but also an environment that is likely to tell them that they're unwanted.
If they're not abandoned, or in some cases killed, what's likely to happen is this person is going to take this child into their house without really wanting this child, you think what comes from this is first fueling anger towards this child, the feeling that this child is to blame for the fact that they didn't get the gender of child that they want, that this child is lesser than what they otherwise could have had, and we think that putting blame and putting anger towards this child is likely going to give them a life that is problematic, that sets them down a path where they're unlikely to be happy moving into the future.
Recognize how foundational parents and upbringing are to future happiness in an individual.
We don't think that life is by de facto, oh claim a good thing to have.
We don't think that life is always going to be enjoyable for the person experiencing that life.
And we think that, a reason that this can happen, a reason that someone could have an on net disutile life, is because of those foundational things that a parent presents and raises their child believing.
If a child is raised in a household where they're said they're to blame for all the agony and all the pain that the mother had to go through, if they're blamed for the fact that they are not a boy and, or rather a girl, or for any of these types of things, if they're constantly belittled because of their gender, we think that these are things that are very likely to happen when the anger that occurs in these people who are not allowed to get abortions happens, and from there we think it's very likely that these people are going to live much less utile lives than otherwise, they than otherwise an alternative child if this legislation were to pass could have had.
And because of this, we think it is necessary to legalize sex selection"
"We should prohibit hydraulic fracturing.
This process, more commonly called fracking at least in the states, is when in order to extract natural gas or other fossil fuels, water is injected down into the reservoir of gas to push it up and make it easier to extract.
So we have three reasons for why it should be banned in the united states and hopefully by other countries as well.
Our first argument is that fracking is very damaging to the environment in regions where it is practiced.
There are a lot of videos online that show people in america being able to light their tap water on fire because it contains so much natural gas.
In these communities the natural gas that was forced up by injecting water has now gone through more porous rock to get into the ground water reservoir.
This means that people's drinking water and all the water in their pipes and in their house is contaminated by natural gas.
Obviously this poses a risk if it's so bad that it's flammable, but this also reduces the quality of those people's water.
The jury is still out on whether it's safe to drink, bathe, and otherwise use this water, when it's been contaminated by natural gas.
But this isn't the only harm.
When you inject water down to replace natural gas oftentimes you damage the sediment or cause it to settle.
This leads to sinkholes forming and otherwise damages the community.
We see that, for instance, if people's houses are built on top of land above a reservoir of natural gas, and it sinks because the water doesn't fill the holes in the rock in the same way that the natural gas did, that people's foundations of their homes can be destroyed and ultimately many people can be adversely affected with no opportunity for compensation because what the companies are doing is completely legal.
We think that the harms to the ground water and the risk of settling ultimately are unacceptable and that fracking ought be banned there.
Even if it's somewhat utile to be able to get to this natural gas more cheaply, we tell you that the third party harms to the people living in those communities are unacceptable.
Our second argument is that fracking leads us to be more dependent on natural gas.
Fracking recently has caused a resurgence in fossil fuel production in america especially.
We see that whereas in the mid two thousands gas and oil production in the united states was on the way down.
Now it has skyrocketed back up and the US is once more one of the world's largest producers of natural gas and oil.
What this means is that new infrastructure is being built to use all of this cheap gas and oil.
They recently built, for instance, a very controversial pipeline through downtown boston to transport natural gas.
When you build this infrastructure, you're locking us into using it in the long term.
It's too expensive to build pipelines or to build power plants that rely on gas or oil and then not use them for forty or fifty years.
They're funded by bonds that assume that they will be in use that long.
So by fracking we lock ourselves into dependence on fossil fuel for the next two generations.
Ultimately this will lead to much higher fossil fuel emissions even if natural gas pollutes less than coal.
The alternative is a world in which we don't exploit this natural gas and instead turn to greener sources of energy like ideally, nuclear power or solar power.
Our third and final argument is that we are setting up communities for failure through the natural gas boom that fracking has created.
If you think about areas like appalachia where there used to be lots of coal mining, those are now the poorest areas in the united states and some of the poorest areas in the highly developed world.
These communities are without economic opportunity because thousands of people moved there for coal jobs that no longer exist.
The same phenomenon is taking place right now with fracking.
People are rushing to areas where there's no other industry and never will be in order to work at these natural gas plants.
Ultimately we're setting those people up to live in tremendous poverty a few decades down the line when the natural gas runs out and america forgets about them.
For these reasons we should prohibit hydraulic fracking.
Thank you."
"We should ban alternative medicine.
So by alternative medicine, I wanna be really clear what we are talking about.
These are practices that people claim are able to cure illnesses but that are either disproven or unproven or impossible to prove that they actually have these effects.
So, many alternative medicines are going to be things like traditional folk remedies, etcetera, but some of them are more exotic, things like homeopathy or crystals or cupping, that don't actually have any positive effect but that people still spend lots of money on.
So we have three arguments for you today.
The first is about why the state ought step in and intervene to prevent people from consuming alternative medicines.
The first point is that there are third-party harms to people choosing to use third-party alternative medicine.
If you, for instance, choose to use crystal magic to treat your pneumonia rather than using actual medicines prescribed by a doctor, then you're much more likely to spread that illness.
We see that while infectious disease may not be a tremendous concern for the types of healthy young people who probably do a lot of debating in college, that is a real concern for young children and the elderly.
These are groups which need our consideration when we think about these communicable illnesses because it's much more serious for an eighty-year-old or a three-year-old to get pneumonia than you or I.
We might be in bed for a few days.
They could die.
So we need to take this very seriously.
We think that that point that there is a clear third-party harm to people choosing to use alternative medicine because they spread these illness.
And we think that these are the type of diseases that people are most likely to use alternative medicine for, things that are fairly serious, like the flu or pneumonia, but not so serious that they would put people in the hospital at which point, presumably, they would receive real treatment.
The second time when the state should intervene, and this is very clear for our side, is when there's an asymmetry of information.
What do we mean by this?
The big businesses that produce these alternative drugs, because don't let the other team tell you that it's grandma in her kitchen whipping up some old traditional remedies, this is a big industry.
These big companies know full well that their remedies don't work.
If they did work, then these companies would file patents and make a lot more money selling them to health insurance companies or national health, etcetera.
They don't work, and they know they don't work, but they're selling them to people anyway and, basically, lying to tell them that they do work.
We think that at this point the government, which has access to the information that it doesn't work, should intervene to protect the common consumers, who aren't educated enough to make this decision for themselves because they're not doctors, they're not attorneys, they don't know whether or not these drugs actually work or whether these companies are lying.
So at the end of the day, we think that the state should intervene.
Our second argument is about public health.
We think that if people went to their family doctor and got real medicine, instead of relying on these alternative remedies, that they would be sick less often.
This would mean that they spread fewer illnesses, remember what I said earlier, but also that they would miss less work, miss less school, ultimately be more productive members of society.
We also think that because people tend to get more sick if they don't receive treatment that more people probably go to the hospital or consume a lot of expensive resources that take up national health money when they use this alternative medicine to begin with.
Our third argument is that this would stop poaching.
This might seem a little strange, but remember that the one big reason why tigers, rhinos and other elephants elephants and other animals are being poached is because traditional medicine in some countries requires body parts from these animals for the cures.
So rhino horn, for instance, might be seen as a cure for impotence in some cultures.
If we shut down this market, it's already true that poaching is illegal.
But if we prevented people from even purchasing alternative medicines, then we think more people would stop believing in alternative medicine, since we could run education campaigns, etcetera to build support for the government action, and this would reduce demand for poached animals, which would ultimately lead to less poaching.
So for these three reasons, we think that we should ban alternative medicine.
Thank you."
"Feminism absolutely brings more good than harm, first and foremost because feminism is absolutely vital in making sure that women are actually treated equally, and remaining gender gaps that do exist are eliminated.
Second, feminism is important because it helps empower women, and it helps make women feel more included in society and more connected with society, and third, I really don't think that feminism has a downside except it takes power away from men that they probably shouldn't unjustly they like unjustly acquired in the first place, from like historical like structures and things like that, or men are just like stupid in some cases and don't realize that these things don't even affect them all that much.
So, let's start by talking about the practical ways in which feminism makes lives better for women.
Obviously, feminism isn't something that's just outdated.
Just because women have the right to vote doesn't mean that they have full rights.
Women still struggle for things like equal pay, they struggle for things like in america like paid parental leave, they struggle against like the acceptance of like sexual, and acceptance or understanding of sexual assault or sexual violence, they struggle against their bodies being regulated with abortion regulations, they struggle with access to like healthcare and contraception, they suffer from like employment discrimination in the workplace, possibly on the base of their body or the like subjective evaluation of their skills being lesser.
All of these things are like very very prominent and very very damaging to women, and what feminism does is it provides a bulwark to like fight against these things.
What feminism does is like it provides like an organizational structure that you can like push for ground like you can push for like legal rights and things like that, so you can have things like the ACLU women's rights project, or planned parenthood organizations.
Feminism creates like a like a support or a unification for these kinds of organized pushes, which do lead to expansion of these rights, and that's important, it helps like you do all those things.
It also leads to women being inspired to like speak out on a lot of these things, so it's just going to be more likely to be grounds going to support all these things.
It also leads to increased awareness, and increased awareness is very important because having awareness of stigmas, having awareness of saxist stereotypes like like the way like is one of the best ways in which you can actually ensure that women aren't going to be like arbitrarily excluded, or to make sure that you actually listen to the concerns that women have on very sensitive issues, like sexual violence or things like that.
It can make sure that women have equal access to things like healthcare, it can ensure that broad whites rights for women are also considered.
Besides all of that, feminism is very important from an empowerment perspective, because I think that the idea that there is like like there is like an entire ideology associated with the empowerment of women is just by itself empowering.
It makes it that women are going to feel more comfortable trying to like go out and succeed in school, the workplace, or even like the basic relationships through their lives.
Because it rather than being told that like your gender is something that makes you lesser, or something that you have to be ashamed of, it creates a sense of empowerment and a sense of solidarity, and these are things that can be incredibly important with women.
It creates like a system of role models that you can look up to, it creates a system of like like values that you can aspire for.
All these things are very very good.
But finally, I think that feminism can bring more good than harm because like, even if you don't buy there's all that much good, like you need to show that there is harm in order to outweigh this, and I don't really think that feminism actually has any harms.
Like the nature of feminism is that they want to ensure equal rights for women, so unless you want their rights to be unequal, which is just like oppressive, inhumane in every conceivable way, then there's no real way to get around that.
So that's for all those reasons, feminism brings more good than harm."
"We should abolish the two-party system.
To be clear what, we want to do in this debate is we're going to say that as a mechanism for demolishing and abolishing the two-party system, we're going to create a parliamentary system in which after a certain threshold, people are political positions and seats are decided based on percentage of outcomes.
So, similar to what's currently done in most parliamentary states all across europe and around the world, that's what we're going to do in the united states, that's what we're going to do with the two-party system.
So why do we think this is going to be effective?
Why do we think this is going to be good?
Two reasons: the first is that you give an increased choice and that that is an immensely important.
So, what do you get an increased choice for?
In the status quo, the two-party system does a very bad job of representing the spectrum of views that people currently hold in the state.
This is why, for example, thirty three percent of people in the united states choose not to affiliate with any party at all and why within those parties, we currently have a system in which there's immense amounts of infighting within these political parties, which means which leads to things like we've seen recently in the united states, where you have a governing party in the republican party that has control of all three branches of government that isn't able to pass the legislation it wants because the party isn't actually a cohesive unit.
The party no longer has that ideological that ideological unison that otherwise allows you to pass meaningful legislation.
Now, we think if you had a multiparty system, if you didn't just have two parties, you're more likely to have a system in which people recognize their distinctions between these parties and are more likely to come together to try and join some sort of governing coalition, knowing that in order to form that governing coalition, they need to make some sort of sacrifices to make it work.
In the status quo, you don't have that recognition of coalition building.
People don't try to build coalitions in two-party systems because they're simply trying to build a majority by making the other side look worse and worse.
This is a system that works for nobody and represents the choices of very few.
It's very difficult to pass popular legislation that the majority of people agree with when you aren't able to meaningfully build coalitions that cross party lines, which is what we see in the two-party system in the status quo.
The second reason why we think we should abolish the two-party system is to decrease that type of division, but not necessarily the political division, but the social division that exists with the two-party system.
In the status quo political environment, we have a very toxic situation in which the two-party system breeds direct competition between the parties, and this leads to a system in which demonizing the other parties to make yours look less bad is actually one that can win.
This is what we saw being done by republicans in the united states for the entirety of the obama administration.
A governing a an entire party in the republican party that wasn't trying to pass legislation.
It wasn't trying to get anything done.
It just wanted to make the other side look as bad as possible.
And in doing that, you created a situation in which people in both of those parties grew immensely had immense animosity form between them in a way that we didn't see fifty, sixty years ago but is very prevalent now.
We currently have a system in which people of different parties don't feel like they can come together and don't feel like they can socialize or try and get any sort of community together between these parts.
It fractures entire communities in the status quo.
We think that a multiparty system, one that has more than two parties, is one that's likely to be less combative than the current system because political parties can't just go around trying to make the other party look worse in order to bolster themselves, because there's now many more parties to choose from, and positive advocacy is what's going to make you stand out amongst the other parties.
When you don't demonize the opposition party that you're facing, when you don't demonize those that are members of those parties, you're less likely to have the animosity we see in the status quo, and you're less likely to see the resentment that the political process breeds.
All of this, we think, forms a more cohesive society and for these reasons, along with the benefits of choice, we should abolish the two-party system."
"We should abolish marriage.
So, in this debate, we're saying that we think that liberal countries, like the united states or britain, should stop having the government recognize and issue marriage certificates.
So basically, if you want to go and get married at a church or a synagogue, we don't really care about that, what we're talking about is the legal relationship of marriage.
And by abolish, we think that people who are currently married would no longer be recognized as different than people who are single, under the law.
So this would not have a grandfather clause, and future people wouldn't be able to get these state-recognized marriage certificates or to get married by a justice of the peace or anything like that.
It would become purely a religious thing.
So, three arguments for why we should abolish marriage.
First, we think marriage enforces harmful social norms.
We see that, for instance, although the united states has gay marriage now, many other countries around the world don't.
So we see marriage is fundamentally something that excludes certain people because of their intrinsic characteristics, things they have no control over.
So we think that it's very biased.
We don't see any reason why gay people in germany, say, shouldn't be able to have all of the same legal rights and protections as straight people.
That means that either you can expand marriage or you can get rid of the privileges entirely.
But we think that expanding the definition of marriage will always be a post hoc solution to problems, that, for instance, we saw that after decades of discrimination, interracial marriages were allowed in the US, but a tremendous amount of harm was done up to that point.
Then we saw that after decades of discrimination, gay marriage was allowed in the US, but a tremendous amount of harm was created up to that point.
It's hard for me to say what the next big social issue would be, but it seems clear that many people will suffer before, eventually, marriages extended to new groups that right now might be excluded.
Polyamorous people are a good example of this.
Right now, polygamy is illegal in almost all western countries.
So we see that these people are being unfairly punished by the status quo.
We think that because marriage is going to discriminate against people like this, it would be better just get rid of it in the first place.
Our second argument is that marriage isn't really the state's business.
From a christian context, marriage is a sacrament.
It changes people's relationship with each other and with god.
Obviously, that's not the business of a liberal state.
For other religious groups, we see that there are still benefits to marriage within their community, but they don't need state sanction to access any of those things.
We think that, ultimately, from the state's perspective, all marriage is is a tax write-off, and we can probably do that just as well by creating other ways for people to claim each other on their taxes.
So, it's not the state's business, which leads nicely into our third point that we would prefer other legal statuses to replace marriage.
So, maybe something like domestic partnerships.
The only legal reason to get married right now is so that you can do things like visit a loved one in the hospital, have a say over their funeral arrangements, and for a few tax benefits.
We would prefer that people would be allowed to just sign up for those things without all of the baggage that goes with marriage.
For instance, if you have a close friend that you are want to be able to control your funeral arrangements, why shouldn't you be able to sign some sort of contract with them.
If you have and I guess the other team could say, "" oh, you could be the executor, "" but fundamentally that's different than the role of a spouse.
In the same way, if people are living together, why shouldn't they be able to claim a tax benefit whether or not they're married?
We think that, ultimately, this is pretty arbitrary, and that there are very few good legal reasons why marriage should exist as a unique status that bundles all of these things together, when they're actually separate interests.
So we should abolish marriage because it leads to harmful social norms, because it's not the government's business, and because we could create other, preferable legal statuses.
Thank you."
"We should abolish personality tests.
With the number of people that are searching for a job far outweighing the number of vacancies, the choice that employers have to make gets more and more difficult because they have a lot more options to choose from, and therefore many of them turn to things such as personality tests, that can use as a as a supportive tool in deciding, that is allegedly objective, and then they remove this responsibility from their shoulders.
We see that the more that these tests become popular in the business sector, and the more this is becoming a common practice, this is starting to become the the like principled basis for the decisions of employers.
Meaning that these tests are becoming, with time, mutually exclusive with more old fashioned techniques, like, you know, good old job interviews or recommendations, and we think that this is unfortunate, because it creates two sorts of problems.
First first sort of problem is, you know, practical problems.
We simply are worried that we that this is a very bad tool in order to give, you know, a precise prediction of who might be qualified or who might actually do a good job.
Second problems is our ethical problems.
Regardless of the way of how, like, precise this tool is, we say that there are still several ethical problems that are being created as soon as we start rating people according to objective criteria.
Let's start with the practical problems.
So firstly, we say that these are very vague and unquantifiable tests.
The questions are often very not clear-cut, and the options that you have to choose from are a very very raw, you know, estimation and very imprecise answer to the actual way in which the the participant actually behaves.
It's it's almost impossible to infer from this any concrete conclusion about the participant.
Secondly, we say that participants try to impress.
The effectivity of these tests is dependent on the assumption that the answers that the participants will provide to the questions are sincere and actually you know exemplify their true character.
But we have no guarantee that this assumption is actually taking place, and it's actually been proven in dozens of researches, that there is a systematical bias that results from the fact that participants tried to adjust themselves and the answers that they give to what they expect that the tester, or the employer in this case, will want to hear.
Thirdly, we say that we just we can argue that there is no such thing as a, you know, rock solid character.
We say that my personality is an ever changing sequence that is affected from countless factors that are not determined.
It changes according to my mood and according to the weather, and every time that I answer these tests, I will have completely other like different results.
Now it's true that in basically every test that we do this we might have a certain difference in in the way that we perform, but in this case we are talking about such radical changes and so such a radical difference, that the answer is simply random and not indicative of anything.
Bottom line, we say that these tests simply cannot be a good metric to measure or to predict how good a certain employee is going to be for the job that he's going to get, and leaning on it too much creates more harm than benefit.
But let's continue to the ethical problems.
Firstly, inherent bias.
So like any other form of standardized tests, many times, and even in an unintentional way, like not intended by the people that wrote these tests, these tests come out very discriminative towards certain groups in the population, that for them it would be much much harder to score high.
For instance, if I grew up in an environment that's less educated and I came from a background that's less privileged, then it's possible that I will always choose the options that make it look as if I am a rude person, just because this is the language to which I'm used to.
Secondly we say that this is a very cold procedure that rates people and assigns a number to each person.
There is no room to talk about it, there's no room for appeals, the answer is final.
This is degrading and it doesn't acknowledge the humanity of the person that's doing the test.
For all of these reasons, we are very proud to abolish personality tests."
"We should ban hate sites.
So, our overview is about how this ban is actually going to take place.
We think that the ban is relatively straightforward.
We would say that DNS and IP providers would be banned from allowing sites to be registered to hate groups as registered by non profits by places like the ACLU and by government organizations, and we would set up crawlers by these DNS providers to check and detect for things that look like hate sites that are appearing on websites that are registered to them.
Two reasons why this is important: the first is that echo chambers are created on these hate sites and they spur more hate and violence, and the second is about why not all speech needs to be protected.
So on these echo chambers: what these sites in essence do is they allow for people who hold unpopular views, which is important to recognize, views that the majority of the public does not hold, they're allowed to come together and speak openly about their hate in a way that they cannot do in the in the public sphere, they cannot do in their public life, because most people find these views to be repugnant.
The KKK, the neo nazis, these groups that are categorized as hate groups, are things that are incredibly unpopular.
But one they're allowed to be in these echo chambers, it emboldens them to say these things in public.
It emboldens them to put these things out there and make other people feel less safe.
And it makes people feel like there are just more people around that hold these views than there really are.
And the problem with that is that it sends incredibly threatening signals to people who are the targets of that hate.
If I'm a member, if I'm a black person and the KKK is marching and rallying and even just one member of the KKK is spewing their hate near me, the fact that that person feels comfortable enough, because of these sites, because the collection of people they've gotten to know online, to say those things makes me feel like there is an imminent threat to my well being in a way that does not allow me to live my life to the fullest.
This echo chamber also further radicalizes the people who are on these hate sites.
It takes people from brooding to outright violent.
And this speech has real consequences.
It makes people more likely to get hurt.
When these echo chambers are created it makes it more likely for someone to go from simply not liking black people to taking actual violent action against them, which is an example, an example of which is when dylan ruth shot up church in south carolina.
These are people and these are echo chambers that create people like dylan roof and make it more likely that these attacks occur.
Finally why does not all speech need to be protected?
Speech is not intrinsically good.
We protect it for three main reasons: first we want an open society with discourse that allows fresh ideas to come to the surface, but the problem with hate speech is that hate speech chills speech.
It does the opposite of what the purpose of this protection is and therefore this is not a reason why we should protect this type of speech.
Second, to allow for self expression.
Self expression for this small group creates harm to bodily autonomy and literally the lives of thousands and millions of people, when they're targeted with this violence and terror.
We think in this instance bodily autonomy and life clearly outweigh the right to self expression that is associated with this free speech.
Finally, we we allow free speech because we don't want the government dictating good and bad.
What is good and bad.
The problem is that hate speech is not morally vague.
It's not one of those things that we need to fear the government regulating.
Heat speech is not an ethical discussion, but rather it undermines our whole social fabric.
The foundation of a quality that our governments and our societies are founded upon are undermined by this hate speech.
And therefore it's not an outright outrageous statement for the government to say this speech is bad, when this speech literally harms the underpinnings and the foundations of the states that we choose to create.
Because of this we don't think that there's any intrinsic good to protecting this speech, and because of the massive harm this echo chamber can do, we think that we should ban hate sites."
"We should ban foreign workers.
We think that what this means is that we wouldn't allow people who we wouldn't any longer give out work visas.
So in order to work in the united states, you either have to have a green card at minimum or have a citizenship.
Two main arguments, first on protecting US citizens.
Current economics state current the current economic state of the united states is one in which the job security of american citizens is uncertain.
A lot of people aren't getting a job even after getting a college degree and doing everything by the book.
Foreign workers take jobs from all levels, whether it's plowing fields or being in research and technology, which means there isn't a field that foreign workers can occupy that doesn't take from the careers of the average american citizen, so we have to prevent that trade off from occurring.
It is a common myth that the that foreign workers don't actually take jobs but rather just like provide competition or whatever or like americans didn't want those jobs in the first place.
We think maybe this is true for like the lower level labor level labor like we're not going to argue that there weren't fields that but I think we do forget that foreign workers take up much more of the general job sphere than just those fields and just being laborers right?
Like you have people who come here to work in everywhere from like biotech to medicine to economics and we think that all of those areas are areas in which they're replacing the average american person who would have that job instead.
The government has an obligation to its own citizens.
When we find ourselves in these kinds of economic situations, the US government needs to make sure that it's providing for its citizens before it benefits the citizens of other countries.
This is because the social contract is between the governments in its own citizens, not the government and the citizens of other nations.
It is its own citizens who pay taxes and allow their rights to be abridged, it is their own citizens that the government claims to represent and that elect the representatives into the government in the first place.
As such we think when the government allows foreign workers, all they are doing is saying that we are prioritizing the economic success and personal development of citizens from other nations above the citizens from our own, which we think is incredibly problematic given that now there are people who suffer because of those kinds of decisions within the US who are US citizens.
Our second argument is about reducing racial tensions.
Even if it isn't the case that foreign workers are actually stealing american jobs, the average american feels like they are.
This leads to all sorts of problems in society including raised levels of racism, xenophobia, and class tensions.
This has real physical impacts with increased violence against foreigners and worse social treatments.
It also makes it harder for foreigners to get rights and any social help they might need because of the dominance of this kind of resentment and this narrative.
People won't vote for better regulations on corporate abuse or labor or kinder laws regarding healthcare and provision there of to those who are not american citizens if they feel like these are the people who are costing them their jobs and preventing them from being able to live economically securely.
When you ban foreign workers people no longer feel like foreigners are a threat.
This is good for every foreigner who obtained citizenship and makes the united states a permanent home because in the status status quo, there's a lot of overflow where the dislike that americans feel toward foreigners often gets directed at foreign citizens.
We can curb this which is net good.
We think that the most important thing in this round is establishing positive contact because in the status quo, although the average american oftentimes has a lot of interactions with immigrants, those interactions are poisoned by the fact that they think that those people are stealing their jobs and harming their future career prospects.
When you remove that kind of threat you actually allow people to see each other for the individuals that they are, you allow for empathy to come in, and we think that's when you stop this kinds of problematic stereotypes that perpetrate in society from continuing.
That's when you stop racism, that's when you stop these kind like this violence that occurs oftentimes.
Proud to propose."
"We should abolish three strikes laws because three strikes laws are horrible from a principal perspective, and they have very like catastrophic practical outcomes as well.
So let's start by talking about why on a principled level three strikes laws are just flat out immoral.
And the biggest reason why they're immoral goes to the immorality of the criminal justice system itself as it exists.
The criminal justice system incentivizes, it essentially forces people who offend one time into recidivism.
And it and it does this because first, prisons do absolutely nothing for rehabilitation.
All they do is punish people and make their lives worse.
Once you get out of prison, you're locked out of most abilities to get jobs, you're not able to vote, you're not able to rely on public housing in most cases, you're not allowed to get public sector jobs in a lot of cases, you're not allowed to get publicly subsidized healthcare or welfare in a lot of cases.
So basically what you do is you get convicted of one crime and the system leaves you behind.
It makes it impossible for you to get a whole lot of work, oftentimes if you're a convicted criminal your license gets suspended, so you're not even able to drive to work or, it's it's like even if you get a job it's harder for you got to work.
The degree and the extent to which we put up roadblocks to people who get convicted is absolutely abhorrent in this country.
And that's a big deal.
Because all those roadblocks to be put up for people reintegrating back into society when they get convicted of a crime, means that there's really not a whole lot of options for them.
And that's why recidivism rates are sky high in places like america.
And that's why we're not really seeing meaningful progress and reform to our criminal justice system.
And that's not even talking about the fact how racist they are and about how three strikes laws overwhelmingly target african americans and other minorities.
So this is a huge problem, because the result of this is that three strikes laws create a way to permanently keep people in prison for minor offenses, for minor felonies.
And they overwhelmingly do it to minorities, and it overwhelmingly happens to people who never had much of a choice to not convict more to not commit more crimes, because they were put in a position by society where that's the only option for them.
But the next thing that I want to talk about is why on a practical level this is a really stupid idea too.
And the number one reason why that's true is because as a result of these policies in places like california it's led to skyrocketing overcrowding in prisons.
Overcrowding to the extent that courts have found that that overcrowding is unconstitutional because it creates a poor living conditions for the people in prisons.
And this is a horrible thing.
Because you're first of all wasting a whole ton of money on prisons.
All of the amount of money that goes into maintaining prisons, paying for prisoners and things like that, is money that you can pay for literally anything else.
You could burn the money and you would be doing more good to society, but but you could also just affirmatively spend it on something better.
But moreover, we're not really talking about people who we even need to put in prison for the most part.
Keep in mind if you commit like murder, or like like a series of armed robberies or rape or things like that, like truly horrible crimes, you're probably going to be imprisoned for decades and decades anyway, because those crimes are so severe.
When you're talking about three strikes laws, the people who commit a crime, get out of prison and can commit a crime again, you're usually talking about people involved in the drug industry.
So you're talking about people who are drug trafficking, people who may just be possessing people who may just be charged with like just simply the possession of drugs, while like but like they keep getting picked up over and over again, because they're minorities.
Or people who commit like more minor offenses.
Those are those tend to be the people who are in prison under these reasons, and that's why there's so much overcrowding.
And that's a horrible problem.
Because a lot of these crimes aren't all that bad for people anyway.
They're things that we shouldn't be criminalizing in the first place, they're things that are absolutely a waste of money, and for all those reasons we should abolish three strikes laws."
"Big governments should be abandoned.
We're not going to set any sort of bright line as to what too big of a government is, or too small of the government.
We're just going to say that principally we would prefer a system with smaller governments to one with larger governments.
We think that that is straight forward and a principle basis that we can have a debate about.
That being said, we've two main arguments.
The first is that the state and states in general are fundamentally unjust and therefore making the scope of that state larger only increases the amount of unjustness that exists and the second is that amalgamating preferences on a large scale is impossible and therefore at a practical level, serving the purposes of a state is much harder when you have a very large state.
Okay so that first argument.
We would say that the state's main function, what the state primarily does, is to limit the natural freedom of other people.
This is via the threat of force that the state can wield against the people with the only sort of legitimate force that can be used in their terrain.
This means that in order for such force to be legitimate you must have some sort of consent of the people that are being witness and being subject to that force otherwise, there's no difference between the coercion that the state is imparting on the people that the state controls than there is between the force that an armed robber is imparting upon those that he is stealing from.
So we think that big government makes that impossible to do.
There's no way to get the consent of all of the people that the law is going to govern in order to ensure that that consent is meaningful and that that consent exists for all.
Let's think of some of the ways that we try and create a proxy for consent.
One of the big ones is through voting but the problem with voting is that one, voting just doesn't cover huge portions of the population that live within the state's borders and two, if you're stuck in a situation between not wanting to be in the state but not having any sort of control over the state AKA not voting and not wanting to be part of the state but voting because it's the lesser of not having any sort of control whatsoever, it shows that there's very little meaningful consent that can be drawn strictly from voting.
The same argument applies when people say that taxes are a form of consent.
Again, taxes are something that are forced for people to have and there's no real contract between the state and the people like some philosophers argue for that there's some sort of tacit consent and tacit consensual relationship between the state and the people and finally you can't feasibly opt out of the state because of you try to leave the state, you're in a situation where you're almost certainly going to have to go to another state to protect you.
Therefore, the big state is naturally coercive.
So on the second argument about amalgamating preferences, we would say that in order to be just on a practical level the state must amalgamate the preferences of the people in the sense that the state should serve the vast majority of the people.
It should try to serve the preferences of the most amount of people.
This is much more difficult to do in a big government and a big state because there are such a diversity of preferences, of backgrounds, and of moral systems that makes it impossible for you to for the state to try and compose all of those contracting views into one cohesive narrative and one cohesive legal system.
We think that small governments cooperating with one another for things like trade and interstate peace do much better at balancing the need for large scale cooperation while at the same time allowing for people most people within a state's borders to consent in and live under the laws that are applicable applicable to them.
That means that when you have a smaller government you're more likely to have more direct democracy, more direct control over who's in charge, and what those laws are, and you're more than likely to have the communal nature that makes it less likely that state is going to need to enforce these types of things through force and through conflict than you are with a large state.
For these reasons, big governments should be abandoned."
"We should ban extreme sports.
For the purpose of this debate, as far as we're concerned, extreme sports or any sport with a particularly high risk to the individual taking part in the sport.
So, rock climbing potentially is an extreme sport, skydiving potentially is an extreme sport, free falling is definitely an extreme sport, etcetera.
Two arguments we're going to give you.
One: when we bar people from harming themselves and why extreme sports falls under that criteria, and two: the harm to others in participation in extreme sports and why that alone is enough to bar it.
Let's start talking about one.
We think, in general, we have a consensus that people can make decisions for themselves, even harmful decisions to themselves.
Crucially, we think this because people have the ability to rationally assess the decision and therefore determine whether for them, individually, the risk of life versus death or joy versus death, in this case, is a risk they're willing to take, and we accept there exists some form of tradeoff here.
The crucial question we need to ask ourselves is: is this being assessed in a rational means?
At the point at which the individual making the choice no longer has the capacity to make this choice rationally, this choice is often taken away from them.
Note, for example, that we'd be quite surprised if opposition said, "" sure, we support people under the age of eighteen participating in these sports as well.
We're fine with ten-year-old kids doing this. ""
Because these people do not have the rational capacity to make these decisions, crucially, at the point where there is no rational capacity to make the decision, governments always need to err on the side of caution, which is protectionism of the life as opposed to the potential joy of these individuals, a: because life is absolute and can be determined versus joy which is comparative and not absolute, and b: because life is what the government is entrusted with as opposed to happiness, thrill, joy, whatever you want to call it.
Why is the individual not rational in these cases?
We say what makes extreme sports unique is the dopamine danger-induced dopamine that gets in essentially injected into the individual who takes part of it.
Note that this is essentially the same as taking a drug, except that drug comes from within you.
It is crucially something that will happen one hundred percent of the time, a massive dopamine rush to the brain every time you jump, every time you fall, including those times you end up getting injured doing these things.
Why does this matter?
First, you need to combine that with a mentality people have of "" it won't happen to me "".
Now this clouds judgment, but doesn't in and of itself make people irrational.
But when you take the mentality of "" this will never happen to me "", a version of the danger itself minimizing the potential risk and the massive rush of dopamine, we say that is enough clout to say that the individual is not acting rationally.
Why do we say this?
Because we think it is comparative to taking drugs.
We often don't allow people to take heroin because we know that it clouds their rationality and doesn't enable to make a rational choice, much in the same way the dopamine injections are something you get addicted to, and that addiction doesn't allow for future rational choices.
Secondly, why do we think there's a harm to others?
Imagine if heroin junkies were seen as role models.
You would bar them from using her heroin, not because of harm to themselves or not just because of harm to themselves, but because other people are shooting up only because of these people.
We think that's the problem that extreme sporters have.
In addition to risking themselves, they also inherently get other people to risk themselves as well.
Why are they seen as role models?
A, because dopamine-induced joy means they always seem to be having fun, enjoying their lives.
That is something that attracts people, particularly younger audiences.
B, their physique is such that it is to be aspired to because that is necessary in order to participate in most extreme sports.
This also makes them seem like role models.
C, they are generally younger people which makes them seem like something most people want to aspire to.
So not only are they risking themselves, they're also substantially raising the potential to make other people risk themselves irrationally.
For all these reasons, please propose the motion."
"We should abolish the right to silence.
So, in this motion, what we think we're talking about specifically is that when someone has been arrested they, in many states, have a right to silence where they can choose not to answer questions that officers ask them.
We would be restricting this right.
Now this right does not include the right to counsel or the right to against self-incrimination.
These are separate and we don't think those are up for debate in this round.
So, we've two main reasons that we should abolish the right to silence but they kind of work together.
The first is about just cause for arrest and holding and why this is crucial in ensuring individual rights and secondly, we want to talk about justice and community over personal freedoms.
So on the first point: in order to arrest someone to begin with, there must be just cause to hold them and then arrest them.
So, as a police officer, if you're going to arrest someone, if you're going to hold them in custody, you must have some sort of evidence before you do this.
You have to have some sort of cause for arrest.
Otherwise, this violates other rights that the person holds.
This cause can be something like reasonable evidence that the person's a fair suspect, it could be something like eyewitness testimony that singles the person out, or something like DNA evidence.
All these things give the officer a reason to believe that this person is a is a suspect in a crime.
There are a number of protections in place to ensure that a person is not being randomly pulled off the streets, and due process dictates that there needs to be a cause.
Given that this is the case, it's not that there are no protections for someone once they've been arrested if you remove the right to silence, but there needs to be there need not be this idea that this right is what prevents abuses of government power to gain information, that this is the only way to ensure that your rights are protected.
If you're arrested and there's no cause for your arrest, then it's fine to say that in those instances, any information gained by the government needs to be thrown out, anything like that can't be used in court.
So secondly, we want to talk about justice and community over personal freedom.
All people who opt into the state do so with the idea in mind that some sort of mechanism will be put in place to protect them and ensure their rights broadly.
This is our police force and our criminal justice system.
This is what people what people created in order to fulfill that role.
All members, irrespective of their temporal circumstance or exactly what their circumstances might be in any given moment, would want this system and therefore consent to upholding it through cooperation and service in the system, like jury duty.
Not speaking with an investigating officer is essentially tantamount to obstruction of justice.
It means that what you consented into, your obligation to uphold this system that protects the rights that you want to be protected, you have some sort of obligation to that system because it exists for your well-being.
And just because you're being questioned in connection with a crime, doesn't mean that you should be a loophole here, that not answering questions isn't still obstruction of justice, it's still it's not still obstructing an investigation.
These are things that are independently crimes and that we think there shouldn't be some sort of right arbitrarily given that allows this crime to be okay.
You still have a right to an attorney and a writing on self-incrimination to ensure that what you say doesn't undermine your own interest to great extent, so it's a balancing act.
It's it's ensuring that the state the state needs to value all the citizens rights, and the criminal justice system attempts to balance this by affording rights to the accused, but other protections are sufficient and do not preclude police receiving important information if possible.
That's the benefit to not having this right, and it makes investigations and criminal operations much easier.
It makes it much easier to uphold our justice system, but it still balances this with the rights of the accused.
For these reasons, we should abolish the right to silence."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should fight for tibetan independence, we being the united states government.
Examples of how we could fight for them would be support given through money to tibetan like rebel groups or the tibetan government, political activism on their behalf, and political like outcries against china, and perhaps even like support through weapons to any kind of uprising that might occur.
Two main areas of clash, the first on fighting for those who are underrepresented and why it is like partially the obligation of the united states to do so.
We tell you that the united states is built on the basis of democracy, and it is hypocritical when we don't support those who are underrepresented by their governments for geopolitical or economic reasons.
Insofar as we recognize this as a core tenant of our own government, we ought also recognize it abroad and not just give people free passes because we rely on them through economics.
But more than this, we think it is necessary for large powers, such as the united states government, to call overreach, especially when people are asking for that support, because otherwise this is seen as passive consent.
We tell you that not doing anything, in instances where you could, makes you complicit in any abuses that occur.
Insofar as we have the ability to call out china and tell them to get better, not doing so makes us just as culpable for any human rights abuses that they might perpetrate against the tibetans as china itself, but more than this, allows them to see that it is acceptable.
Recognizing that there is no consequence for their actions emboldens chinese overreach and allows them to perform worse acts in the future.
Our second area of clash, however, is that china gave up their right to sovereignty over tibet when they stopped treating them like real citizens and have never actually treated them like real citizens.
Even if you disagree with the principle that the united states specifically should chime in regardless, we think the fact that china has given up their right to sovereignty means that all countries should fight on behalf of tibet.
So what do we mean by this?
We think the right to self-determination is incredibly important insofar as individual groups of people know better what is best for them than those who are unrelated.
This is why it is would be a problem, perhaps, if the united states took over let's say, cuba, because in the end the united states is just too far away, too culturally distinct, and not invested in the safety of the cuban individuals, cuban people, in the same way that those people are.
We recognize that I'm probably better at deciding what is best for myself because I'm the one who has to live with those decisions, and I'm the one who can prioritize what I want to prioritize, rather than some unrelated individual.
We tell you that the second problem to this is that when you are unrelated, you are much more likely to see those people as a means to an end rather than an end in and of itself.
What we mean by this is that because the chinese government doesn't care about the tibetans equally to that of their own citizens, they're more likely to treat them facilitatively like lower than their own and try to extort them from it.
So, human rights abuses, using their labor unfairly, not enforcing equality policies because it benefits the chinese government, all of this is more likely because the chinese government doesn't care about tibet as much as a tibetan government would care about tibet.
More than this, we think that when china didn't that china stopped fulfilling the social contract when it started perpetrating human rights abuses against tibetans.
What we mean by this is that even though tibetans are still expected to pay taxes, they don't receive the same kind of protections that other chinese citizens do from the government.
Things like religious oppression, not allowing things like buddhism to be allowed in the in within tibet and prevents people from self-actualizing based on their religious preference, over-policing, the act of imprisonment of any tibetan protesters, the torture that is used within these prisons are all violations of sovereignty.
Insofar as you insofar as your sovereignty comes from the people that you govern, when you start abusing those people, you lose the right to them.
We think all of this means that, collectively, the united states and other large powers ought fight on behalf of the right to self-determination of the tibetans.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should cancel the social security tax.
So in the united states everyone who works has roughly ten percent of their income taken aside before they receive their paycheck and contribute it to the social security fund.
And this is a fund that's meant to provide for elderly people after their retirement so that they don't fall upon really hard times.
So basically the amount that you receive when you're elderly is based on the amount that you paid in while you were working, and everyone who receives a paycheck regardless of income pays the same rate.
So two big reasons why we think that we should cancel the social security tax.
The first is that we think that this tax is fundamentally unfair.
So the tax is regressive, because everybody pays the same tax rate we think that it's fundamentally unfair.
The reason why is that the value of a dollar is much greater to someone who is poor than someone who is wealthy.
If you think about the story in the bible about the widow who only had two pennies and she gave one of them to the temple and then jesus said that she was more giving than somebody who had millions and millions of dollars who gave a hundred thousand dollars to the temple because that one penny meant so much to her.
In the same way when you tax someone for social security if someone is making a very limited amount of money, that ten percent could be the difference between paying their rent or being able to buy healthy food versus someone who's very wealthy might be making the difference between a mercedes and a toyota based on the social security tax.
So we think that it's fundamentally unfair because it's not progressive.
Next we think it's unfair because people won't actually received the money that they pay in.
The people who pay in right now are not the ones who are going to be able to collect the money in the future.
Because there are so many people who are about to retire, the baby boomer generation, social security is going to become untenable.
So millions of people who have paid in for their whole lives, there's simply going to be no money left in the system when those individuals retire.
Which basically makes social security seem like a ponzi scheme.
Basically everyone is told if you put in money now you'll have more money when you retire, but that relies on there being more people who are younger and working for the system to continue to function.
And that's simply not the case because population growth in the US has largely stalled off since the baby boom after world war two.
So at that point we think that this is unfair because people have been lied to about what they're actually going to receive when they retire and people are putting in money to a system that will never be able to give them anything in return.
So our second point is that we think that there are much better ways to help the elderly.
On our side we acknowledge that something needs to be done to help elderly people after they retire so that they don't fall on hard times.
But we think that a much better system that would only be possible if you get rid of social security would be to have private investment funds that everyone contributes to with mandatory contributions.
So basically require everyone to take the money they would have put into social security and put it into an account that they can't touch that's then invested on their behalf.
So we think that people could either choose to invest it themselves through something like vanguard which is a company that does this in the united states or perhaps it could be managed through some sort of employer run program.
But either way we think that people would be able to retire with a lot more money than they get out of social security if they invested from a young age.
And some communities in texas are actually already doing this.
They received an opt out from social security and they have these mandatory funds and people are retiring and actually having a much higher standard of living than people who rely on social security.
But we don't think that you can ask people to do both.
No one can really afford to give up twenty percent of their income who isn't already choosing to do so.
So we think that social security is preventing us from accessing new and superior ways to care for the elderly.
And when the policy was implemented back in the 1930s, it's probably the case that people didn't know that this was an option or that it wasn't an option yet.
But times have changed and we think that the way that we care for elderly people should change as well.
So if the other team actually cares about helping the people they claim to help with social security, they would be better off with banning it and replacing it with private investment funds and if you had mandatory contributions everyone would have something to get when they retire.
So for these reasons because we think the tax is unfair, and because there are better ways to help the elderly we should cancel the social security tax.
Thank you."
"We should limit freedom of speech.
We think that whereas some countries like the united states guarantee almost absolute freedom of speech that it would be better to take a more restrictive approach such as some other countries like canada do in terms of what is acceptable for people to say or write.
So our first argument is that freedom of speech trades off with safety.
If you look at the types of freedom of speech restrictions that many western countries have, they're going to be things that are designed to promote public safety.
For instance in germany anything that's pro nazi or nazi symbology were banned after world war two and this was done to ensure that we wouldn't see resurgences of fascism in germany and ultimately to promote public safety and obviously it was very successful and germany is a much safer country today than it was in the fifties but it's still important that we maintain this anti nazi sentiment in order to prevent any sort of backsliding.
And this isn't just something that's unique to germany, for instance white supremacist speech in the united states has led to many people committing acts of violence.
There was an incident late last year where a man on a trolley stabbed a person to death because he was protecting two muslim women that this insane white supremacist wanted to stab and ultimately this white supremacist and many other white supremacists in the united states in recent years were encouraged by online websites that are completely legal to promote white supremacy and neo nazism and all these other heinous acts.
So we say it would be better if the US banned white supremacy in the same way that germany has banned neo nazism because ultimately there's no benefit to letting people wave a swastika around and say kill all jews whereas the harms that accrue to the people these lunatics are going out and stabbing are all too real so the tradeoff is obvious.
It's much more important we promote the bodily safety and autonomy of minorities than that we protect the rights of majority groups to say we want to kill all minorities.
One of these things is not like the other and we think that it's absolutely acceptable to restrict freedom of speech given real world harms.
And an objector might say that they would ban for instance an immediate call to violence but think that people should be allowed to have ideological beliefs that are harmful but all fascist ideological beliefs are intrinsically harmful so we don't think that there is any room for them in civil society.
Therefore we are perfectly okay with banning fascist or fascist-like speech.
And our second argument is about the effect that lying has in our society.
So we're not saying that it should be illegal to tell your wife that she looks good in that dress rather we think that things like fake news are very damaging to our society.
For instance many large news agencies in the US, in britain, and I'm sure in other countries outside the anglo-shpere basically only exist because they lie in order to whip people up into a furor.
So whether it be certain disreputable newspapers like the daily mail in britain or whether it be websites like breitbart in the united states there's a whole industry now of just lying to people to encourage voters to vote against their own self interest.
This has very real impacts.
Brexit for instance probably would not have happened if it hadn't been for newspapers telling people that all of these things that weren't going to happen because of brexit would happen so many papers like the telegraph or the daily mail made it seem as though the european union was forcing britain to take a bajillion muslim refugees and it was going to turn britain to the next saudi arabia but all of this was just lies, straight up there was no truth to it but people believed it so they voted for brexit and now the british economy is suffering because of it.
Moreover many people's lives have been disrupted and it's just been a disaster all because of lying in the media.
So we absolutely think that we should be able to restrict freedom of speech when it comes to fake news or news that's designed deliberately to mislead people.
So for these reasons we should restrict the freedom of speech.
Thank you."
"We should raise the corporate tax.
So, in the status quo, we're not gonna like argue about numbers exactly, but we would substantially raise the corporate tax rates that currently exist across developed countries.
So we don't want to argue, like I said, about that number, but we think that this would be a substantial raise, one that would probably be something like fifty percent to a hundred percent higher than the current rates.
All right.
So, two main arguments: the first is that we think we need to correct for the wealth disparity that currently exists.
In the status quo, a disproportionate amount of wealth has been accumulated by the richest of the rich, while poor and average families have suffered.
While productivity has increased tremendously over the last number of decades, median earnings have remained stagnant since approximately the nineteen eighties.
This in turn is coupled with a cost of living that is going up, especially in urban centers where jobs are most prevalent.
We think that the average worker's simply entitled to a higher take-home of the profits that come into the corporation, but job scarcity and the corporatizing of industry, the fact that one corporation can own any number of different firms and different businesses, has made it easier to drive down wages.
The c-level executive a company does not put a hundred times more labor into the day-to-day operations of a business than the average employee does, and the c-level executive is further dependent on those below to create value and actually produce the product that they're going to make money off of.
We think that corporate taxes allow for wealth to be redistributed, and this hurts the pockets of the wealthiest far more than it hurts the average worker, because their salary isn't dependent on corporate profits, their take-home bonus isn't dependent on corporate profits, and they are the lifeblood of the corporation, which means it's much easier to cut salaries of, say, a c-level executive who's already making millions upon millions of dollars than it is to cut the salary of every employee across the company in order to pay these higher taxes.
We think that you can use that money to create kickbacks for the american worker that can do a tremendous amount of good.
First, you can improve infrastructure and provide opportunities at public employment, which means that you can get better jobs and create a more competitive job market.
But also with an with additional infrastructure, we think you make innovation and more entrepreneurial entrepreneurship more easily accessible to the average person.
You can also increase education to help future generations to ensure that the economic divide does not remain at the level that it is today.
And finally, you can just provide lower income tax rates or provide more tax rebates for the average american worker.
You don't need to increase the total net sum of taxation and taxable money that's coming in, which means you can put money directly into the pockets of people that are currently being shortchanged in their wages.
Secondly, we think it's important for these companies to internalize the harms of their production, and the corporate tax rate does this.
In the status quo, corporations rarely have to internalize the full harm of their production.
There are two areas where this is most dramatic: environmental damage and pollution is the first.
These companies can dump, produce emissions, do all types of things that harm the environment but because those things those prices aren't internalized by them, they're internalized by the the world and the country writ large, they can pass products on to consumers without having any hit to their bottom line, which corporate which raising corporate taxes would do a number would would help reduce the amount that that corporations are currently able to skid by.
Second secondarily, corporations in the status quo take short-term risks to please shareholders.
They do things like speculate on current economic productivity, and this ultimately leads to economic shocks that affect us all.
The reason for the housing crash and the two thousand eight recession was because of corporate speculation and poor corporate practice, yet the dramatic amount of harm that came from that was almost all internalized by the average person, not by the wealthiest off.
We think it's we think that raising corporate taxes force companies to internalize those costs ahead of time before that recession happens and secondly, prepares funds for the state for the recession and the recovery spending that is ultimately necessary because of corporate action.
For these reasons, we should raise the corporate tax rate."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban smoking.
There are two standards to ban that are usually accepted in legal terms and within like political terms and both of those will become our independent points.
First we will demonstrate that there's extreme harm to yourself and others.
If we show that people can't consent to the extent of the harm they will experience it shows that they shouldn't have the opportunity to be tempted by it in the first place and thus it ought be banned.
No one can consent into the long term harms because no one can contextualize or imagine themselves ending up addicted.
Everyone always thinks that they can stop or that they have enough self control.
This is something that is integral to human nature, something that we will never get rid of and something that people necessarily need to be protected by whether it's by seat belts, guardrails on cliffs, or bans on like incredibly harsh substances like heroin or cocaine.
Further you can't imagine getting lung cancer or a series of other illnesses because you never imagine yourself getting to the point where you are so addicted that you were getting all of these chemicals into you.
Not only this but there's a massive asymmetry of information when it comes to any kind of activity and we think that oftentimes corporations purposefully pull the wool over peoples' eyes and lie to them and tell them that they're not as harmful they designed this one cigarette that is magically going to be so much healthier than the other ones and this misleads individuals to feel like what they are doing is non-harmful and the only way the government can protect against that asymmetry of information and prevent corporations from doing this is by banning the practice entirely.
But also recognize the comparative here.
I think it's incredibly problematic that it is scientifically established that drugs like cocaine are less addictive and oftentimes less harmful in terms of the long term in that they carry more risk of a particular symptom occurring but on aggregate that one symptom really rarely occurs whereas with cigarettes it's like very continuously established that it's really likely to occur and yet for some reason cocaine is illegal but cigarettes aren't.
But even if you don't buy that, if you show you if we show you that other people are significantly harmed, it doesn't matter if the individual can consent because the individual cannot consent for other peoples' harms.
Secondhand smoke is incredibly damaging and causes breathing problems and cancer almost to the extent of a smoker in individuals who have never touched a cigarette.
And we think that's something that a smoker can never consent to on behalf of their children or on behalf of their housemates or anyone who happens to be close to them.
Moreover in households money for cigarettes often trades off with money for other needed goods and harms that family economically.
Also addictive behavior is often learned from your parents so children who are born into houses with cigarette smokers are often designated to become smokers themselves and lead the same kind of life as their parents.
The only way you break these cycles and prevent other people from being harmed is by banning the practice.
Our second area of clash is about the pertinent government interest that exists.
Via healthcare costs alone we can explain to you why cigarette smoking ought be banned.
Cigarettes are incredibly physically detrimental.
Companies specifically target poor regions so large portions of addicted individuals don't have insurance or rely on government support.
Millions in health care costs occur due to cigarette related injuries that are a drain on government funds and a drain on governmently funded healthcare systems.
And so we think that the point this these these are resources being taken away from other illnesses that people have infinitely less control over that the government cannot regulate in the same way then it ought be regulating this one.
But economically it's also a bad plan.
Cigarettes are really expensive and the money just goes to large corporations and those were already rich.
These are millions of dollars that could better stimulate the economy and create true growth.
A lot of the time people compromise a more diverse set of goods to be able to afford cigarettes.
For example because I bought cigarettes that week or because I have a certain amount of budget allocation to cigarettes, I'm not going to buy something that was like maybe an item for the house or something that I like wanted for a while as like an amenity and we prefer that they would buy those items and stimulate the economy in that way rather than buying cigarettes.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should ban coal mining.
So we think that in areas where coal is commonly mined, such as appalachia in the united states, that its harvesting should be banned.
Right now in the status quo coal mining is heavily subsidized through various federal programs and hasn't been profitable in most of the united states since the early twentieth century, but many communities in states like west virginia are completely dependent on coal for their existence.
We say too bad.
The externalities of coal are much too great and the cost to the rest of society are unfair.
We need to get rid of coal completely, not try to prop it up with the myth of clean coal or whatever west virginians are peddling to the rest of us these days.
Our first argument is that coal is environmentally destructive.
In order to extract coal, it's often necessary to tear apart entire mountains to get the maximum amount of coal inside.
So it not only damages areas while it's being extracted by polluting water and harming people who live there, more on that in just a moment, but it's not like you can ever return to these places and find them back in the condition they once were.
All of the topsoil washes away, all of the animals have to leave, and you're left with a barren wasteland as a result of coal mining.
We think that it's not bad enough that coal is one of the largest things that's destroying our environment through climate change, but also that the extraction of coal is an environmental disaster.
For both of these reasons we ought to get rid of it.
Our second argument is that banning coal would force communities to move on.
Many communities really just should not exist that were founded around coal.
People moved into really harsh parts of appalachia because there were coal mining jobs a hundred fifty years ago or a hundred years ago, and then they stayed and today really there's no reason for these towns to exist.
They're far away from any type of jobs or resources except for coal so they're heavily subsidized by the rest of the country in order to facilitate their existence, more on that in just a minute.
We say that it would ultimately be best for these people to just tear off the bandaid and make them leave.
It's true that people may not want to leave their communities but it's also not for them to stay and continue to do the same things that they're doing right now.
We need these people to move to cities or to other states where there are jobs and start contributing to society rather than just continuing to mine coal that's ultimately detrimental even when it's able to be sold.
So that's the main reason why we're okay with getting rid of these communities and I think that there's much to be admired about appalachian culture but many parts of appalachia such as in north carolina would still exist so it's not like we're getting rid of these groups entirely just forcing them to move around within that region.
And economic forces are already doing this so we think that ultimately we would just be accelerating a natural process in order to avoid some of the harms being dragged out over the long term.
And our last point is that it's necessary to end subsidies for coal.
When, for instance, we make it possible for coal towns to exist via massive amounts of welfare spending we're effectively subsidizing the coal industry that doesn't pay for what it actually does to communities.
This is money that isn't being spent on other more serious concerns.
Rather than propping up coal mining, we should be focused for instance on developing alternative energy or developing alternative ways for people to support themselves once coal goes away.
And there's a direct trade off here.
Government money is fungible and the amount of federal tax dollars that can go to states like west virginia is ultimately very limited.
So we think it's important that that money be spent to help people rather than to help coal mining companies.
These companies have known for decades that what they were doing was killing the earth and killing innocent people and they don't care, they don't deserve our help or our sympathy.
The people who live there do but there are better ways to spend this money to help them.
So for all of these reasons, we should abandon coal mining.
Thank you."
"Childlessness is advantageous.
So in this debate, we're talking about people who could choose to have a child, not people who are unable to do so or prevented by their government from having children, but people who could choose to have a child and choose not to.
We think that that is an advantage for them over the course of their life, and obviously there's pros and cons to having children.
We think that in order to win this debate, our side only has to show that there are more benefits than harms.
Three arguments: the first is financial.
So, childlessness is a financial advantage because raising children is tremendously expensive and, this might sound a little callous, but you don't get a big return on your investment.
If you think, for instance, about the cost of raising a child, they say it cost over or about a million dollars to raise a child in america today.
So if the average american makes two to three million dollars over the course of their lifetime, then an enormous portion of their lifetime earnings goes into taking care of this child for eighteen years.
I assume that that includes things like higher education and the cost of healthcare and things like that.
But look, imagine you didn't have a child and you put all of that money into a retirement account.
By the time you retired, you'd be a millionaire.
And on top of the money that you already would have saved, you're probably a millionaire twice over.
We think that individuals will have much greater security in their old age as a result of not having children.
Which gets directly at a big argument for the other side, which is that they're going to tell you that children take care of you in old age, so you need to have children to look out for you.
But your children, at the time when you're old, are going to be having children of their own.
They're not going to be able to continue to support you at a really good level, at the same level that you could support yourself if you just didn't have children to begin with.
So I think it's clear that the money that you save is more than worth it.
Our second argument is about how this helps your career, and I want to say that this goes double for women.
Recognize that if you're a woman and you're a few years out of college or secondary school, and you're thinking about having a child, let's say you're twenty eight, which is probably the average age in the US, you're going to have to put your career on hold, not only for the time that you're pregnant, but also recovery afterwards.
And probably when you have, you know, a young baby around the house, most people want to be home in that time to look after them.
So you're taking three, four years possibly, if you have two kids, out of your career, at the minimum, and it's going to be very difficult for you to come back to your career from that.
You'll be making much less money than men would at the same time, who didn't have to put their career on hold, and also you're setting yourself back, because you're giving up some of your prime earning years in your early thirties in order to raise this child.
So we see that, ultimately, particularly for women, not having children makes your career much better.
Now the other team is going to say, "" oh.
Well, it's okay to put your career on hold because there's all these benefits in terms of how good you feel about being a parent "", but lots of people feel really good about being a lawyer or a doctor or a professor or any other job.
But I think those are good examples because they're the kind of jobs you can't really have or that it's very difficult to have if you're a woman who has children at a young age because, ultimately, you're gonna have to take time off in your career when you would just be getting established and your career might never recover.
And even for men, we think that your career will be benefited by being able to move around more, obviously, you have more flexibility if you don't have children, and by not having to worry as much about, you know, spending time at home.
Our last argument, then, is about why we think you get more individual freedom.
So, if you have children, suddenly your first obligation is to them, not to yourself.
As a parent, we think that your primary responsibility has got to be to your children.
They can't look out for themselves, they're entirely dependent on you to take care of them.
Which means that if you have something, say you wanted to quit your well-paying job in order to go be a carpenter.
That would be pretty irresponsible if you had two children who are relying on you to help them pay for university, because you're really limiting their personal freedom in the future.
So you can't do something like that.
We think that you have a lot more ability to change careers, to move, to decide that you want to get a divorce, anything like that, if you don't have children.
So because you save money, it's good for your career, and it maximizes your personal freedom, we think childlessiness is advantageous.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should privatize the united states social security system.
The model for this is fairly simple, individuals will get an option of a tax through reduction in income where instead of social security the money taken from their income goes into a stock portfolio of their choosing.
I think an overview to this is that recognize that the payouts for this are comparable, but actually better than regular social security insofar as like you get what you paid in later in life, but because you have the ability to get things out at a market rate rather than like the social security rate, you actually get a lot more.
But more of that into our three areas of clash: first on why this is a more efficient system.
Recognize that social security doesn't pay out at market rate.
If you consider the social security a tax on investment, it pays out actually incredibly poorly compared to other investments.
It only does like four to five percent.
Especially if you lived a short life and then you really don't get much out of it, because you don't actually have very much time post retirement that you are able to take advantage of social security coming back to you.
But the market rate is closer to nine percent so if it's privatized you get better returns and more money out of it, and you also get to start withdrawing at any point that you desire.
So even if you don't leave a particularly long life you still have the ability to take advantage of social security.
So someone who gets to like sixty four, gets cancer, knows they don't have much left, can withdraw very quickly and things like that.
And this brings us to our second independent point which is about why this system gives greater control over money.
Currently there is very very very little control over money that is put into the social security system.
Not like in with regards to even the amount that comes out or when it comes out or anything like that, because there isn't actually a way that is like determined by you to control it.
Like everything is controlled by the government, the age that you got it back at is the government, and you get monthly payments determined by how much money you made.
But when it's privatized you can choose how much how you use that money.
Maybe you need to take a really large chunk out early so that you can buy a house in your old age, maybe you're still capable of working in what your kids to get it later on.
Something that the current social security system can never offer is the heredity of a privatized system, where you can say: "" okay, like I'm not going to use this.
I'm going to keep my money invested so that my children can like take from the stock portfolio and be happy. ""
We think that individuals are the best arbiters of their own good, not the government.
IE the government can't keep track of every single individual and know what they need in their life and know what's going to help the most.
So we actually think it's incredibly useful when people can say: "" here's how I know I can use this money, so here's exactly what I'm going to do. ""
Our third area of clash is about why social security is like not only bad governmentally, but also why it's like pretty much doomed to fail as is.
The government borrows a lot from social security without actually telling the public because it wants to keep taxes low.
So it borrows from social security and uses that for things like the military industrial complex, like random other funding mechanisms, without informing the public about it.
So the massive amount of debt the united states has, like a very large portion of that is to the american people because they keep borrowing from social security.
This is an incredibly undemocratic system in which they can artificially keep taxes low, continue lying to the american consumer and citizen, and keep like the political favor and all of that.
Because a lot of the things that they use this for our oftentimes incredibly controversial.
Without government ownership of social security the government won't have that kind of easy money revenue stream so they're forced to cut spending or pass realistic taxing policies.
Both of these things we think are preferable for the american citizen.
But also we think the fact that now this money is consistently traveling through the economy, rather than just sitting in some like in some federal bureau lake area, is really really good because it means it's constantly contributing.
Constantly being borrowed by other banks and being used to power economic growth.
So we think that's good.
But also, recognize the system itself isn't functional for much longer.
We don't have enough money to keep it going and so we need an alternative.
Insofar as people are having way less children than there are adults, so they're not actually not money going in that has to be paid out generation per generation.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should abolish homework.
In this round we're gonna make two main arguments about why we think homework is on net a detriment to students and to the education system as a whole.
Firstly, let's talk about the pressure that modern children face in our day and age.
Modern children face the need to fill themselves with both extracurriculars for college as well as to do well in school and there's an immense amount of pressure to go to college in the status quo because college is seen as the gateway to success in your future.
College is seen as the way of getting a secure job.
It seems like it's the first step in becoming a real adult is going through college and on top of that, there's also immense pressure to get scholarships to pay for that college.
So it's not just that students need to do well enough to get into school, but it's that they need to do so well that they can get into school and pay as little money as possible with ever rising tuition costs.
This means that students need to both expend themselves academically and recreationally to get ahead and this is what we see just empirically, especially in countries where where college is so important to many people.
Let's look at for example a student that may have a full load of college level courses and their school AP courses, and in addition to that they may be doing an after school course class, and in addition to that they're a boy scout, and they're volunteering, and they do theater, and they do a sport, and they do all of these things to build up their resume to show colleges that they are well rounded.
But homework makes what is already an incredibly challenging task of balancing school and extracurriculars even more difficult especially in secondary school and high school because frankly, there's almost no coordination between teachers as to how much homework is going to be given out and there's often multiple hours of homework a night.
Especially for students that are in the highest level courses, they get an even higher level of homework and this compounds the fact that these are also often the students that are doing most the most extracurricular activities.
The need to do but you also need to do homework to maintain those good grades and to maintain your standing with teachers.
There's simply not enough time in the day to be a kid, let alone to get done both these extracurriculars and your normal schoolwork and they often have to sacrifice sleep or their own well being to and we don't think that this is the point of school.
We don't think that this is the point of education.
Secondly, we think homework is ineffective.
Now the idea of homework is that it reinforces the lessons from the day's class and that practice makes purpose perfect but there's a few problems with this.
First, too much homework means people rush through that homework to try and get it done because they just need to move on to the next thing and they don't actually internalize the lessons.
They just go through the motions and try and get as much done as they possibly can.
They just want to get it complete.
There's also larger problems that go against this idea of trying to reinforce the day's lessons.
Like the fact that there's in many countries an incredibly long summer vacation and long holiday breaks that are the real cause for students forgetting material.
In fact, in the united states the first month of every school of every new school year is basically spent recapping what was taught over the course of the last year and if students and if students don't understand the material in class, homework often leads them farther astray.
Doing the work the way that you think it's supposed to be done when you're doing it incorrectly because you didn't understand it the first time, only makes it less likely that you'll be able to learn it correctly moving forward.
We simply think that even if there is some sort of benefit to homework, even if it did impact and reinforce the day's lessons, we simply do not think that it is worth the massive amount of harm that it places on children both their mental in their emotional well being.
For these reasons, we should abolish homework."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should disband nasa.
What we mean by this is that we would remove like change we would stop all nasa proceedings stop giving money to them reallocate those funds elsewhere and then presumably allow all of the current resources to be adopted by some kind of private corporation and let all the the employees go.
Two main areas of clash.
First on why private corporations are more effective.
First I think it's really important to note that nasa is not an independent agency that gets decide its own goals or requirements.
Rather it is an agency that has to listen to the government a group of un scientifically trained individual in terms of what it ought be pursuing.
Next the problem here is that the people who it listens to in the government are individuals who are beholden not to the scientific community or to the betterment of humanity but rather to the constituents and public eye.
What this means is that nasa is always going to inefficiently spend a lot of money on showy on more showy actions because it sounds better to the public and allows a better rallying cry around that space travel than if they were a group that was purely scientific and purely deso to other scientists.
Like at the end of the day we don't need more rovers on mars but we keep putting it there because it looks really good politically and provides a rallying point for the general populace around being really proud of our country for doing things even though we've done it a million times before.
What we actually need to do is focus more on fundamental research and mineral mining but because these are things that are inherently less attractive to the public eye it is never possible for nasa to fully designate all of their resources to it.
Moreover we think that you end up with more investment in private corporations that do things related to space through space acts when investors are not afraid of the government pulling putting their industry out of business.
Insofar as nasa would always be a government endorsed competitor risk averse investors will always be afraid of investing instantly in something like space x or other private space corporations because they wouldn't know at what time the government would just pull their shit together and nasa would run everybody out of business.
We think that we make this investment less risky on our side of the house when we actively do not have nasa anymore.
And we also just want to talk a little bit of on the difference in incentive structures because we already established that politicians are enabled for are are incentivized to listen first to their constituents but recognize that when it comes to private corporations they're always going to be holding to their stockholders and not the public and recognize that when you are a stockholder in a scientific or not like space really corporation it's very unlikely that you're someone who has like a particular like interest in anything other than the signs that you're invested in like the reason that we invest in the things is because they're going to be economically solvent and good for society.
And we think that when you're investing in a space corporation you have to know something about it and know something about the needs.
And so we actually think that you're going to end up with much more science focused space exploration on our side of the house.
But our second area of clash is about why there's a better way to spend this government money like recognize the government's obligation exists as citizens first in because of things like the social contract but these aren't just like obligations like a whole like we think this is like arbitrarily and like spread across rather we think that it's like designated obligations that like rise in hierarchy of following like the hierarchy of needs right like what we mean by this is that the government should act to fulfill basic needs first insofar as this is where people truly harmed and where the government fails to fulfill their fundamental obligation.
The need for nasa is never going to be more immediate as compared to the need of food having food or not having housing and we think the government should focus on providing those basic needs first given that thousands of their constituents need it more than they need to know that there's an international space station.
Like we think at the end of the day that the government ought be providing a basic standard of care to all individuals and if it is not fulfilling that for the majority or even for a few than it is not fulfilling its obligations as part of the social contract for these reasons proud to propose."
"Big governments should be abandoned.
So by big governments we basically mean powerful, centralized national governments which have a great deal of control over provincial governments and over many aspects of their citizens lives.
And by be abandoned we mean that we would prefer a devolution of power to lower levels of government and less government involvement in people's lives in general.
So with this in mind we have three arguments for our side.
The first is that we would prefer local democracy to more large scale democracy.
In general we think that for a democratic government to be effective the elected officials must be accountable to the people whom they represent.
If you are a united states senator for california then you represent thirty five million people.
There's no way that you can possibly be accountable to all of those individuals.
On the other hand, if you are a city council member in san francisco you might represent two thousand people.
We think that if it's possible to gather all of your constituents into a gymnasium and actually talk with them, then it's much more likely that you'll actually be accountable to these people.
At the end of the day we think that one of the problems with big government is that the people making decisions are so far removed from the people on whose behalf they claim to act.
We think that ultimately this prevents them from making decisions that reflect the wishes of ordinary people because they don't ever interact with them.
They don't know what ordinary people want.
We think that devolving power to regional, state, or local governments would ultimately mean that more power was invested closer to individuals.
This way people would have more control over the government as it affects their own lives and we think therefore that the government would be more legitimate because it would better reflect the will of the people whom it claims to represent.
Our second argument is about the inefficiency of large governments.
We think that there is a tendency for large governments to become bloated over time.
The reason why is that there's very little impetus for them to ever slim down or trim fat when it arises.
Consider that ultimately, if you are a bureau of the united states federal government, and I'm sure this is true in britain and germany and other countries as well, then if the only oversight comes from political officials who benefit from the work that you do, then there's never any incentive for anyone to think about how to make your bureau more effective or more efficient.
As long as you do the work that gets the politicians re-elected, no one really cares how much money you spend.
After all it's all taxpayer money so many people feel it doesn't really belong to anyone.
It's very abstracted.
On the other hand, the local level, because you have greater levels of accountability, ultimately we think you have more of an incentive to be efficient because you know the people whose money you're spending.
And what's more, it's easier for ordinary people to keep an eye on spending in their community versus in london or washington or berlin or wherever.
At the end of the day if you see that government officials are doing a poor job in your city, it's much easier to do something about that then if there's a problem going on hundreds of miles away in the capital.
So we think that there are greater checks on local government then central government.
And on top of that that there's more of an incentive for people to care about how money is used and that all of this leads to a more efficient use of state funds.
Our last argument is about government overreach.
We think that as you centralized power in these large federal governments, that ultimately there's an incentive for the state to interact in every part of people's lives.
After all if you're already regulating so many parts of someone's life, it seems relatively easy to regulate other parts as well.
This is probably why we see things like liquor monopolies in many parts of the US and canada, even though governments probably don't have any business selling alcohol.
But if a state is so involved in people's everyday lives then it seems perfectly natural to them.
At the end of the day we think there would be less overreach if we devolved more power and people had more control over how the state interacts with them.
For all of these reasons big government should be abandoned.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should further exploit wind power.
What we mean by this is that we prefer a world in which we use more wind power than we currently do.
I'd say that it would be preferable to gas or oil, so a world in which it is used more than those sources is one that we are advocating for.
Two main areas of clash, the first on long term environmental solvency.
Global warming is environmentally destructive.
Rising sea levels destroy coastline towns and kill thousands, changing weather pattern patterns kill livestock and change the spread of disease so that there's more starvation first because your crops and your livestock are dying due to veter weather patterns that are unpredictable, but second there is also more death from diseases that people in those regions never experienced before.
If I'm not used to living in a world with where west nile virus is a real threat, I'm not going to be prepared when the weather changes allows those mosquitoes to start living where I live.
So we're basically creating a world in which like in which people can never defend themselves from diseases or from starvation because you never know when it's about to hit.
We tell you that this is only going to get worse if we don't switch to cleaner energy sources because currently, when we are still propagating the use of gas and oil, we are only adding more and more emissions.
Even things like changing the technology that we use to be more efficient doesn't change the net amount of emissions and doesn't give us a long term better world because it's never going to be perfectly clean.
Recognize that wind power is renewable and ever present and exactly the kind of thing that will allow us to prevent to prevent global warming from proceeding further because we are able to put up large large stations that can power entire towns at once practically eliminating the need for gas and oil, at least in housing situations, so at least we'll only be using it for cars.
Our secondary of clash has to do with long term economic solvency.
Recognize that on a global scale we are running out of gas and oil.
Sure there are certain pockets that are oil rich but first, this leads to individual nations having dependency on those that happen to arbitrarily be placed on top of those pockets, but second, it only means that we have like those particular nations have a longer amount of time before it runs out.
Either way the end result is running out and the sooner we start to counteract it the better because the closer we get to running out, the higher the price gets.
What this does is leaves entire countries either completely dependent often on middle eastern countries that happen to be oil rich.
This is problematic because being economically tied to an unpredictable and irrational actor that can boost the price as they see fit leads to a unpredictable and thus risky economy which investors are afraid to invest in and in which other prices tend to go up but second, it leaves people without access to these kinds of goods which is very damaging economically insofar as in order to be able to be a productive person and spend money elsewhere in the market, I have to first have access in a at a reasonable price to basic necessities such as heating for my home or being able to drive around in my car.
So at the point that it is economically bad for these countries, we think that wind power is a much safer economic choice.
First it is a lot cheaper given that it only requires initial installation and then further and then like future maintenance afterwards rather than repeated incredibly risky rigs that oftentimes spill some of the oil that you are gathering and oftentimes having to buy oil from foreign powers that can pull up the price on you.
We also think that it provides a new economic stimulus by allowing space for new technology and new development and research.
Oil and gas are old.
Sure fracking sometimes develops a little bit further in terms of technology, but all in all what we've discovered about oil is all that we can get.
However with things like wind power there is so much room for the technology to grow and so much research yet to be done that we think it is positive for the investment to be made now and for it to be exploited further currently.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should legalize cannabis, cannabis being marijuana.
Three main areas of clash: first on people's rights.
Recognize that marijuana is banned massively for racist and elitist reasons to do with south american drug wars and the stigma on the individuals who happen to use mind altering substances.
But recognize that there's not actually like a right for the government to ban in this situation.
I think there are generally two standards which we use to recognize whether a government can ban something.
The reason these standards are necessary is because we strive to live in as democratic of a nation as possible, IE a country in which individual people have as many rights as possible.
But we also recognize that rights aren't absolute insofar as the government has to do and limit some rights in order to do things like retain order, fulfill obligations to its citizens, etcetera etcetera.
But these two standards tend to be either to show that there is like meaningful harm to yourself and others or to show that there's a pertinent government interest.
I think the problem becomes that there isn't actually like a harm to marijuana use.
Especially in comparison to things like alcohol or cigarettes which have been proven to be a lot more harmful but somehow escaped any kind of real government regulation, aside from age restrictions that would apply to marijuana as well.
Recognize that there isn't any physical harm.
At most, very long term use leads to some changes in the aggression neurotransmitters.
But unlike alcohol and unlike tobacco there aren't any associated cancers, there's no long term addiction that is like associated.
And as such we think that, like especially to the comparison to the like the standard that society has already set, there's no feasible way in which we can ban in a rightful manner.
But more than this, I think there's no government like pertinent government interest in a ban either.
If anything, we think that there's an economic interest in not banning this insofar as like, as I will get into later, this has massive economic benefits.
Our second area of clash is about exploiting the pragmatic good.
The problem with bans is that they often times limit what we can do with the item that is banned in the meantime.
This means that even though we have a lot of preliminary research that is incredibly promising in the field of marijuana, it's really difficult for us to get any kind of really established research that would let us start prescribing it in a meaningful manner to as many people as might need it.
However we do know that it's incredibly helpful.
We've observed that it can be good for helping people with insomnia, seizures, pain management, like this is something that could literally lift thousands and thousands of suffering individual out of pain.
And I think that that's like in and of itself an impact that is incredibly important.
But second under this, I think that clearing out prisons of individuals who are there for light drug offenses is also really important.
There are too many people in jail for light drug offenses.
Often underneath a racist enforcement insofar as it is infinitely more likely for a person of color who was caught with drugs to get arrested than a white person who gets caught caught with drugs to get arrested.
This is vastly due to our perception of white men in white young women as people who are just having fun and experimenting and have only gotten off the track for a little bit, while people of color tend to be more aggressive and tend to have gotten themselves into their own situations, as poor white people's world view.
And so we actually think the fact that it's like partly discriminatory is bad.
But on like a purely pragmatic level, we think that it leads to like more inhumane prisons, insofar as they're more crowded, and we think that it's like preferable for individuals to not be in prison, slowly like unlearning how to be citizen of society, but rather being able to re-integrate.
Like be with their family, all of that.
Our third area of clash is about economic benefits.
I think like the start of a new market is really important here.
Because soon after marijuana legalization, we saw states like colorado like increase in economic power like many many times over.
So we think that insofar as it like brings new jobs and it can be heavily taxed, this is really good economically as well.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"We should tax remittances.
Remittances are money that is sent by workers in one country back to their home country or their family's home country in order to support their family.
Normally, what this looks like is migrant workers in wealthy countries sending money back to their family in a less wealthy country.
So, for instance, lots of people who come from central american countries like guatemala and el salvador will send money back from the united states to their family in that country.
We propose that a small tax be placed on remittances or any money that is sent out of the country for these purposes.
We have a few arguments for our side: the first is that remittances siphon wealth out of a country.
Generally speaking, if you have workers in your country, they are saving their money, which means that banks can lend that money out within your country in order to facilitate investment, or they're spending their money, which means that they're putting more money back into the economy by consuming goods and services and supporting businesses in your economy.
But with remittances, that's not really happening.
All of this money just leaves your economy and goes somewhere else, and you don't even get anything in return for it, the way you do with trade.
The problem with this is that that means that there's a huge opportunity cost for your country.
Whereas a dollar that a worker owns, who spends that money in america, goes to local businesses, goes to the local economy and creates more growth, which then lets you hire more workers in this sort of virtuous cycle, a dollar that's sent home for a remittance goes on to create economic growth in guatemala, or el salvador, or whatever country this money is being sent to.
So this doesn't really benefit your country at all.
We think that governments need to be aware of the fact that work that is only possible because of their regulation and their laws isn't actually benefiting their people and their economy.
By placing a small tax on remittances, you can offset this harm and ensure that your economy continues to grow and that you're not losing out relative to other countries.
Our next argument is that there's a huge amount of lost revenue on this remittance money.
If someone buys something in your country, they're normally going to pay either a value added tax, a VAT, or a sales tax.
We can see that in countries like britain, this is a substantial part of the government's overall revenue, and in places like the united states, this is the main funding for local and county governments and, oftentimes, the main funding for things like schools and public transit.
So when that money leaves for remittances, you lose out on VAT and you lose out on sales tax.
What this means is that if you were planning to collect one percent of all sales tax in order to fund a big public transit infrastructure, this is really common in american cities, now you're losing out on that money, and people who are taking the subway every day to work aren't paying into its expansion and maintenance the same way that other workers are.
Given this is the case, I think you can offset that loss by having a separate tax.
You could think of this as a tax in lieu of sales tax or in lieu of value added tax.
In essence, in order to fund the infrastructure that's necessary for these people to work, you can tax their remittances.
We think this is fair because these people are earning the money that they're using for remittances by using infrastructure, and they ought pay into it in the same way that everyone else does.
Now it's true that sales tax is kind of an invisible way that people pay into their infrastructure, but it is an important factor in how people ultimately maintain their city and maintain their economic well-being, and it's one that we think ought be distributed equally onto all people based on their work.
So, on our side, we've explained to you how your country is losing out, relative to other countries, if you have too many remittances and, also, how we promote infrastructure spending and the like by replacing sales tax.
For all these reasons, we should tax remittances.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should legalize cell phone use while driving.
I think the important thing to remember here is that we can still promote not using cell phones while driving and explain why this is a very bad idea or something that ought be avoided, like create massive education campaigns.
I think on both sides of the house we can agree that we will massively decrease the number of people who do it.
The question is whether or not a ban is justified and whether it should be illegal in all situations.
Because I think it's the case that people respond fairly well to like rational reasoning and explanations about their own safety.
Oftentimes better than they do to just a blanket ban or like a legal rationale.
With that, two main areas of clash: first on the ineffectivity of bans.
I think factually it is important to establish that studies have shown that since instituting the ban the amount of texting related accidents haven't actually decreased.
This is because people aren't discouraged from actions by bans.
Especially when those bans often only result in light fines, such as in the situation with cell phone use while driving.
They just assume that there they'll be the ones who won't get caught.
You need to impress the real life harms on individuals in order to have the make any kind of change.
This is why oftentimes it doesn't work to just tell someone abstinence only sex education, rather you have to actually explain: "" look, STD's are a problem.
Look, like pregnancy is a problem. ""
And then have them weigh the costs against that rather than just being like abstinence is the only way.
And I think that that's like actually very important comparison.
Because I think in the same way that we have to explain to people the rationale for why they should wait for sex or use protected sex, the same goes for cell phones while driving.
It's not enough to just say it is banned, rather you have to explain it is incredibly unsafe, like it's going to do something that is bad for you, it can harm others.
We think that it creates a false sense of solvency when you say that it's like banned and therefore the problem is solve.
You assume that it is dealt with so you stop funding future solutions.
Moreover, cops lose the incentive to educate and publicize how bad of an idea texting while driving is, because now they make money off of arresting and stopping people for texting.
They search for the opportunities and prioritize them making money off of these stops over people being safe.
And I think of this kind of flip is actually really problematic, insofar as these like people who are supposed to be most on the side of security now have an economic incentive to let people get like to let people be ignorant so that they'll get in more trouble.
Our second area of clash is just about showing you that in certain instances it's really important that texting while driving be something that is legal.
I think a lot of the time there are like instances of texting while driving that are perfectly safe as long as you're not doing it on a highway, you're driving underneath a certain speed limit, if you're at a like light stop, all of these are situations in which no one is actually harmed by you texting, and it is really unlikely that you're going to cause an accident.
I think the issue is when people do this during like very high speed areas, or on like bridges, or like they stop paying attention to like traffic, etcetera.
And I think that these are judgment calls that individuals can make and don't actually require a like blanket ban.
And I think it's important to recognize that sometimes incredibly important things are going on in people's lives that need their attention to.
Like I think sometimes we receive messages that contain incredibly important information.
Either like, even if it is like something as simple as like what our plans are for the rest of the day or where we're driving, but they can also range things that are much more intense.
Like a lot of people receive word of like some like some ill having befall on a family member, or like a crisis of some sort.
And these are things that we don't think people should have to feel obligated to wait for, especially in situations where they aren't actually costing anyone else any harm.
We also think that it oftentimes gets less safe when people are trying to be more secretive.
But even that's not true, we think that people often have a right to do things that might be harmful to themselves or others.
I think smoking cigarettes is like a really important example because even though it has massive spill over effects via secondhand smoke we still see it as something that is like a right to an individual.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish capital punishment.
We think this is not like mutually exclusive with intensifying other kinds of punishments like we that we're fine with doing things like replacing capital punishment or like replacing the punishment for crimes for which capital punishment would have been used with harsher sentences and things like that what we're not fine is that we just like don't think it's okay to kill another individual in response to a crime.
Three main areas of two main areas of clash, first on why it is immoral for a few reasons.
First we think that it is incredibly cruel.
We think that insofar as like human beings are choosing whether or not to punish other people like there is no overall authority that is able to define whether or not someone deserves that which is coming down on them we use certain kinds of standards to make sure that our internal biases and like our other kinds of natures or our vengelfulness doesn't come against just like basic human rights and respecting individual life and we think that one of the standards that we use is the standard of cruel and unusual punishment which we see legally recognized in multiple states but we also just think is a good principle to follow insofar as we buy that individuals probably are intrinsically equal and even if you do something that is very very bad you probably don't deserve to be treated with intense cruelty insofar as punishment can be given to you in other kinds of ways and we think that insofar as death is the ultimate end to anything that you can accomplish in the future we think it is the ultimate form of cruelty that it deprives the individual of everything that any other person will be able to experience in the rest of their life.
Insofar as it doesn't meet that basic standard we don't think that it is something that ought be performed but also under think under this we knew that it is an incredibly racist policy and an arbitrary one in that we know that people have certain biases that tell them that certain races of individuals are more dangerous or more likely to have committed crimes than other ones so we see this with how we see that the capital punishment is instituted infinitely more often for black men than for white men even when they commit the same exact crimes and insofar as this racist enforcement occurs we don't think that's a moral action or something that is morally justifiable.
But also we think that the arbitrariness of it is also dangerous in that insofar as whether or not I end up with the death penalty or just a couple of life sentences in prison can be defined by whether or not the judge had lunch before.
We don't understand how something so arbitrary and so non generalizable can ever be moral.
But finally we think the real center here is just that it has the massive potential for harming the innocent.
Insofar as the guilty can get punished even without capital punishment but on the other hand innocent get the ultimate rights violation we think that it is never justified to commit capital punishment on the off chance risk that you are going to kill someone who is who is actually innocent because of all the damage that they will suffer so and we think that ultimately is what really makes it immoral and can never ever be justified because we think that these kinds of purposes of punishment happen to make sure that someone doesn't commit a crime again or to make sure they're no longer dangerous for society things like that but we don't think any of that comes into play when you are hurting those that you are supposed to be protecting in the first place.
But our second area of clash is just about why it's unpragmatic.
First recognize that the death penalty is actually more expensive than just housing someone in a jail first because you never have the opportunity for parole so whereas costs can be cut down significantly when individuals are let off on good behavior and things like that with jail time this never happens with the death penalty but also because it has so many bureaucratic holes that you have to jump through in terms of liability and in terms of the drugs that you have to pay for and things like that and all the people you have to pay along the way it's actually statistically a lot more expensive to kill someone as punishment than it is to keep that person in jail and insofar as we think that any money that comes out of like the taxpayer's pocket is probably a loss to the taxpayer when it's not used to benefit them and this is just a punishment for someone else we think that that's something that is incredibly unpragmatic and ought not happen.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should adopt open source software.
What this means is that we prefer a world were on balance the majority of corporations and the majority of any kind of internet use or like program use was based on open source software.
Three main areas of clash, first on why it is very good for innovation.
Recognize that there is a massive problem in the status quo where developers battle patents that create twenty year moratoriums on any kind of creativity or true innovation with that piece of technology.
The problem here is that this necessarily stagnates and cuts off how much progress we can make because there are just swathes of code and swathes of tech that no one can touch due to patent law.
But we think that it is really bad when we don't get to fulfill our true technological potential because of these kinds of laws.
We want a world in which everyone has the ability to work on this code and work on this technology like be able to contribute it and be able to come like have eyes on it because it necessarily creates the world in which the most usable technology is created in which and in which individual parts and individual components get exploited for their full potential because it is impossible for any person to understand everything about computer science and be able to exploit every corner of a like given piece of technology or given tool but when you have this open source any computer scientists can access it and so you can have multiple different fields and multiple different groups of expertise working on the same subject which we think is incredibly possible.
We also think that it's really difficult and incredibly time consuming for one group or one corporation to figure out all of the different ways in which a piece of technology can be used, but when other people are free to figure out figure this out for themselves, they necessarily will do so because they also have a profit incentive to be like to be innovative and to be creative and to do things with this.
So we actually think that like rather than letting these things stagnate and like given that corporations will not be able to exploit them to the full potential and especially given that corporations are going to be fine either way because they don't need to be making as much money or holding as many monopolies as they do we think it would be good to open it up to the public.
Our second area of clash is about security.
When something is not open source, people have no idea what a code is actually doing to their computer.
It means you can have secret bits of code that can like be actively violating your privacy, tracking your emails, tracking your location without your permission but also code that could be making use of your CPU or other powers of your computer to do tasks that you may not have agreed to ie mine bitcoin or do other things that are beneficial to the developer but that you never consent into then as therefore are like using your resources without your consent.
But on a a secondary level more eyes on this kind of technology means more people finding security flaws.
Recognize that any given piece of technology often comes with hundreds and hundreds of individual security flaws that could be exploited and used to get into the software and into your devices but a lot of them aren't actually that hard to find and fix.
It's just that there's tons and tons of code no economic incentive to go deep digging too deep but we think that when there are like tons and tons of people looking at this code looking for these security flaws because they have more of an incentive to protect their individual computer than a corporation ever will you necessarily offset some of that harm and make sure that they will be able to solve it and fix it.
A really good example of this is how every single new like version of kodi comes up with a different set of security measures because on this open source software people are free to find this like these problems and fix them on their own.
Our third area of clash is about reducing fixed costs for corporations.
Recognize that because open source patents are still patents but they have just been vetted prior so that patent trolls can't take advantage of them, corporations necessarily don't have to spend as much time or resources to to vet these patents for themselves.
This means they both avoid patent trolls but also that they can have a much smaller start up cost because it is cheaper to make that technology and so it is actually much more likely that they will do things that are social good rather than just profit driven to attract venture capitalists.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"We should abolish nuclear weapons.
So before we start this debate, we want to give a model for how we think this would play out, because we think there are clearly a lot of complexities that are associated with the issue of nuclear weapons.
So we think that this would take place in the form of scaling down over time, and we think that each state would have different check marks that they are supposed to clear every year, and there would be an independent commission, there's already independent united nations bodies and other international bodies that monitor nuclear weapons, we think those same bodies would be responsible with ensuring that people are scaling down at the rate that they're supposed to.
So, we think what's important to recognize in this debate is what the status quo actually look looks like, because since the cold war, people haven't thought about the potential of nuclear holocaust or mutually assured destruction, but recognize that devastation is easily possible.
One mistake, one miscue, one one individual actor getting a hold of a nuclear weapon and using it, can result in the nuclear holocaust of the entire world.
We think that current systems for monitoring, storing, and launching weapons are obsolete, especially in the united states where most of the infrastructure revolving around nuclear weapons is the same infrastructure that was put in place during the cold war.
These things are wholly obsolete, and could easily result in in these weapons being used accidentally or improperly.
And in other areas, where there is less secure storage, it's there's a potential for a bad actor, such as a terrorist group, to get a hold of a nuclear weapon and use it against civilians.
These things, if there's an accidental use, because of mutually assured destruction, are almost guaranteed to result in the widespread use of nuclear weapons, which means there's not just the possibility of one weapon use, if there is a weapon use it is almost guaranteed to result in the use of many nuclear weapons, which, as is widely known, is likely to lead to a bad outcome.
And these things have come shockingly close to happen in the past, both by the united states, by the soviet union, by other actors.
So, aside from this, why do we think nuclear weapons just aren't a legitimate weapon of war in the first place.
So even if none of these risks existed, why should we still abolish nuclear weapons.
Well, first, they're indiscriminate.
Nuclear weapons are guaranteed to cause harm to civilians almost certainly even if you're striking military target, because of the massive blast radius and because of the nuclear fallout.
And on top of the fact that they're indiscriminate, they're also similar to chemical weapons in the fact that they are unjustified in their use.
They're not they're likely to cause long term ailments of civilians and other people, it's likely to cause lingering health effects, it's likely to cause radiation poisoning, and these things can be incredibly harmful and incredibly painful for individuals, and we think that this is not a justified weapon, for the same reason that we don't allow chemical weapons to be used in war, because the method of death is in and of itself cruel and unacceptable.
And finally, we just don't think that nuclear weapons will ever be a proportional response, except to another nuclear weapon strike.
But as we've already explained, if there are multiple nuclear weapons flying back and forth between a state, this is almost certainly going to result in the widespread death of billions of individuals, because these things are likely to lead to mutually assured destruction.
So, given that this is the case, we don't think there is ever an instance in which these types of weapons are going to be used acceptably.
We think that any use of a nuclear weapon is going to be a bad use of a nuclear weapon, and that if there is ever a use of a nuclear weapon, it's going to result in the end of humanity.
This is not the purpose of a weapon, this is not the purpose of war, and even though these things are unlikely going to be used intentionally, there's a high risk, a high possibility that these things will be used unintentionally, which will result in all of the same harms as an intentional use.
And for these reasons, we should abolish nuclear weapons."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should legalize polygamy.
Two main areas of clash, the first on the principle.
Marriage is, first and foremost, an institution about love occurring between one or more people, and it's about what those people experience and the the emotions rather than the parameters.
All of the qualifiers, IE, gender and number of partners, etcetera, are manmade and often oppressive parameters that don't actually pertain to the principle of what marriage is about.
They were often created by those with more power in religious institutions and governments so they are never actually representative of the majority preferences either way.
As such, there isn't actually a good reason not to allow polygamy.
It's been both anecdotally and scientifically shown that people can love multiple other people at the same time.
If their love is the same as your average two-person heterosexual couple, then they deserve the same rights in the same way that we've come to accept that people who are homosexual deserve the same rights and marriage.
Not only is their love the same, but their reasons for desiring marriage are also the same.
They usually want their commitment to be legally recognized, want a stable basework from which they can raise children, want legal protections when it comes to divorce or splitting goods later in life.
To win this round, opp has to explain what is so fundamentally unacceptable about being polygamists and what is so different about polygamists people versus those who are monogamous that makes them unqualified to be with the people that they love in a way that is equal to others.
Because it also is fundamentally untrue that they are that these people are somehow different.
In the end, they are all like made of the same material, like in the eyes of the law they are all individuals that are equal, and at the point that they also love in the same way and want to participate in the same kind of traditions of society, we think that there is no reason that you ought be able to to exclude them from it.
And in fact we think it is discriminatory to say that because of the way in which you choose to express your affection and because of the number of people to whom you choose to express your affection, you are unqualified to the rights that others have, especially if you are still like basic like basically in terms of a human person, deserving of the same rights.
Our second area of clash has to do with why it's important to extend legal protections to polygamous relationships.
Polyamory is a fact, with or without legal standing.
People are going to be living in group relationships, they do so in the status quo, and this is something that is rising in popularity.
In the end, governments are not going to be able to stop them.
So the only question in this round is whether or not you're going to extend the same legal protections, given that you're never going to be able to make it go away.
As many like to bring up, there are instances of very abusive polygamy, especially in relation in religious communities.
The problem in the status quo is that the these women end up trapped in these relationships and have nowhere to turn to, in part because they are not legally recognized.
Opp might say that this is better because governments can just shut these marriages down, but there are a few problems with this.
First, women will not report if they feel like it will destroy their entire communities.
Oftentimes, it is difficult for them to recognize their own abuse because this is where they are raised, and once they do recognize it, they feel immense amounts of guilt when they know that their actions can affect all of the communities around them.
But second, because these communities work much harder to hide their relationships, when it is not legal, and it makes it much easier to lie and say that we are not actually married if like someone actually comes knocking on the door and saying, "" are you polygamous? ""
But also, on a less dark note, even non-abusive polygamous relationship deserve legal protections.
Cohabitation necessarily means the mixing of resources, and a lack of marriage means that there's no official way to split communal property if things go sour.
We think it's incredibly important for people to be able to say at the end of a relationship, "" here is what you are deserving of, and here is what I am deserving of "".
And when these things are difficult for people to make decisions on on their own, we want the government to be able to step in.
Especially when kids are involved, there is no legal enforcement currently to define custody or, taking a step backwards, to even adopt a child together in the first place.
Also, we think it would be nice if they were also eligible for tax cuts.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should introduce covenant marriages.
To be clear we wouldn't institute a system in which covenant marriage is mandated but rather we would allow for there to be a legal option to be bound under a covenant marriage as opposed to a standard marriage that exists within society.
And this would of course would come with the constraints of making it much more difficult to receive a divorce with different types of pressure being placed on the individual to ensure that they stay married in the long run.
We would say that these covenant marriages can be annulled if certain requirements would be met but we've set those apartments at a much higher level than marriages are in the status quo.
Okay so firstly, about the option for religious expression.
And the secondly, what long term marriage does as a social good.
Recognize that even if society doesn't believe that should adopt certain religious values, having the option of a covenant marriage option that recognizes the importance religiously of not having divorce, of staying married, does not ensure that a state endorses any particular religion, but rather simply gives individuals within that state an option of more full religious expression.
It means that individuals can go to a or go to the state and have something legally bonding placed upon them that helps them stay true to their faith.
We think this is important because for those most faithful individuals, we think that they should be forced to consider the ramifications of their decision more clearly before they get married.
They should be forced to recognize that the bond they are taking, even if it is not in the status quo legally binding in perpetuity, is one that because of their belief system, is permanently binding.
And we think that if a state apparatus can allow for that faith to be more meaningfully expressed, if it can allow for that faith to be more fully expressed, and if it puts constraints that makes people seriously consider their faith more, when it only applies to individuals that have that faith, we think there is no loss in instituting this type of system.
We think it's good that individuals are able to have the most full type of religious expression because these types of religions these types of religious beliefs about marriage and about connection with a spouse are so fulfilling to individuals in the status quo.
So aside from the religious benefits, we think that there are real benefits to long term marriage that a covenant marriage helps to protect because it makes it such much more difficult to get divorced.
Firstly, it ensures that if you it insures that because you're thinking more about your marriage you're more likely to marry someone that is going to be a stable partner.
So whether or not you love your partner, a permanent partner does allow for an immense amount of financial and social security even in instances when you may be struggling.
When you're tied to someone and when you have a partner in life that is going through the same types of struggles you are, that is bound to your struggles, it makes it much easier to bear the burden of that struggle.
It also means that if you're having a long term marriage, you're much more likely to have a stable household for any potential children.
Children have no choice about what type of familial household they're going to be born in and it's just statistically true that single parent households are much more likely to lead to a situation which a child struggles moving forward in life.
We think that covenant marriages, because it makes it more difficult to get divorced, is more likely to ensure that you don't have single parent households.
That you have a situation in which both parents feel a responsibility to stay for the child.
Finally we think because we think finally we think there's a benefit some think that you're less likely to get into a legal battle over assets which can be not only struggling and detrimental to any sort of semblance of relationship you have with the person you're getting divorced from, but can also leave you in immense destitution moving forward in life.
We think that marriage as an institution allows you to have a partner, allows you to support children potentially and allows you to be in a more stable situation.
Given that covenant marriage is not mandated but rather an option.
We see no downsides the government introducing it and that's why we should introduce covenant marriage."
"Same sex marriage brings more good than harm.
So, very straightforward debate: we think that allowing men to marry other men, women to marry other women, ultimately does enough benefit to society that the benefits outweigh any drawbacks that this might have for society.
So with that in mind we have three main arguments for you today: the first is about maximizing personal freedom.
We think, first of all, that maximizing personal freedom is good in and of itself.
That people who lived in you know an imaginary state of nature, where there was no government, would have much more freedom than they do even in the most liberal of liberal democracies.
We see that states necessarily remove some people's freedom, but that ultimately everyone wants to have the most ability to make decisions for themselves.
So it's a balancing act between the need of society to have stability and individuals desire for freedom.
Whenever possible though we ought defer to this freedom because in order for people to self actualize, to live happy successful lives, they need to be able to make decisions about themselves.
Individuals know their own best interest better than anyone else knows what is good for them.
We think that at that point, it's clear that same sex marriage brings more good than harm because it provides a tremendous amount of personal freedom for individuals in society.
We see that, you know, a certain percentage of the population is gay and that those people one, deserve equal freedom to straight people - just because they happen to prefer a different sex doesn't mean that they should have less personal freedom - but on top of that we also see that it maximizes their ability to self actualize by opening up more options.
Even if many people choose not to marry, that is still a choice in itself that we think should be left up to individuals rather than made for them by the voting public.
So because it maximizes personal freedom, I think it's clear that this does more good than harm.
Our second argument is about the benefits to social stability.
We see that when people get married, their behavior tends to change.
People who get married are more likely to have children, and you might say: "" oh well gay couples to have children "", but in many countries they're allowed to adopt and many people would probably choose to have surrogate children, things like that.
They're more likely to have children, they're more likely to purchase homes, they're more likely to be willing to establish themselves in a given community and not move around frequently.
And all of these are good things for society.
You want people to buy homes, you want people to have children, because in the long term that's what's going to perpetuate communities, that's what's going to make your country strong thirty years down the line.
So at the end of the day we see that the benefits to social stability greatly outweigh the benefits this might have, or the harms this might have, rather, for other people, and we think it really that's just that some people are uncomfortable with the idea of homosexuality.
But that leads nicely into our third and final argument which is that this normalizes homosexuality.
So, same sex attraction has been part of human culture forever effectively.
You see it in nature, it's a natural part of life.
Certainly if you look back to ancient times, you know the ancient greeks were much more likely to be tolerant of this than many modern countries are.
We think that when you allow people to marry in a same sex way, that this makes them more sympathetic to people who are homophobic in the status quo.
Because there's an idea in many countries, certainly in america, that gay people you know sleep around, that they live this very extravagant very gay lives, and I think that that doesn't reflect the experiences of most gay people, certainly that I know, most gay people, all gay people do the same things as anyone else.
They just happen to be gay.
But in order to get people to recognize this, you need to allow homosexual people to follow the same course of life that straight people follow, so that they're more relatable to their straight peers, and we think that marriage is a really good way to do that.
So for these reasons, same sex marriage brings more good than harm.
Thank you."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of today's motion that we should ban that we should legalize same sex marriage.
I think the model for this is pretty intuitive, right?
Just like a government should just recognize same sex unions and that you just change the definition of marriage from a man and a woman to just to individuals who consent into the marriage.
Three independent points under this: first, that autonomy is something we should respect including for gay people, secondly that bans on gay marriage increase instances of homophobia, and thirdly that there ought be a separation of church and state and in so far as the opposition to gay marriage is largely religiously based, we should recognize that like this is a poor reason to oppose gay marriage.
So, first on autonomy.
I think it's worth recognizing that autonomy is a good thing.
It is the most fundamental right that we have.
The reason why we care about life is that we can do things and not like condemned into slavery, right?
The reason that we care about our health is because that enables us to actually have decisions like the ability to do the things that we want to do.
Autonomy to the maximum extent is always going to be good in a vacuum.
When the government is justified in infringing on autonomy?
It's because that autonomy comes into conflict with someone else's autonomy.
So like murder for example is banned because we recognize that when one person kills another person, that limits the person who is killed's autonomy to a very large extent.
So, we look at these two things that we say: "" oh okay well you know, your right to kill someone is a lot less important than your like right to just be alive. ""
So we restrict the thing that restricts the other person's autonomy.
So, there has to be an externality to an action.
A way in which somebody else suffers or has their autonomy limited as a result of your actions in order to for a ban to be justified.
The problem is that gay marriage doesn't have externalities.
People aren't affected by this, right?
Like if I engage in a union with another man, someone standing down the street or someone else in society isn't affected by that union in a meaningful way.
And even if they are like peeved by it, or they find themselves made slightly uncomfortable, we think that is a much less significant harm tan the harms that will be enacted upon myself and my partner by not being able to engage in a lawful union.
That leads me into my second independent point that instances of homophobia and harms upon gay individuals are magnified by a ban.
This is true for three reasons: so, broadly that it normalizes homophobia.
That it normalizes the idea that being gay is like the other and is not acceptable within mainstream society.
So three harms to that: first it increases instances of assault and discrimination because it normalizes the idea that gay people or the other and that you can treat them like the other.
That you can engage in housing discrimination or that you can assault on the street, things like that.
So when you take down the veil, when you say: "" no, it is okay for these people to enter into legal union "" you take down the legal basis or at least the societally justified basis for why it is okay to discriminate against gay people.
Second is it creates identity crisis of most especially young gay people that they think that this thing that they experience, that is completely natural, completely acceptable and doesn't affect other people's lives in another way, isn't okay because society has told them it's not ok, because there are these legal signals that their identity is wrong.
So recognize then, that that is a harm.
There is massive psychological trauma associated with that.
That is why like suicide amongst gay teens is so massively massively high.
Thirdly, when you push people onto the fringe of society, there are harms intrinsic to that.
So like, for example, how like a lot of gay people used to have to be prostitutes.
Like in the, you know, the eighties and even today to a large extent, because they are put to the fringes of society and are told: "" you are not good enough to be within like a normal context of society and act as a normal member of our society "".
So, the third independent point I'd like to advance is the separation of church and state and why that's an intrinsically good thing.
Like recognize that the opposition to gay marriages largely religiously based, that there's like some textual arguments about this from like christianity particularly, but it's important to note that the state shouldn't be involved with like shouldn't make policy decisions on a religious basis.
That it shouldn't favor particular religions or even religiosity in general when compared to secularism because that necessarily favors one group in society over another.
It's for this reason, these reasons rather, that it's important to recognize that the opposition to this policy is fairly ridiculous.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish needle exchange programs.
So basically what needle exchange programs are is when drug addicts can go into government funded buildings in which they can exchange dirty needles for clean ones with the hope that this prevents the spread of blood borne illnesses and keeps people healthy while they are like taking drugs.
Two main areas of clash, the first on why government endorsement of drugs is bad.
When you're using government money to provide drug addicts with a method of injection, it is an endorsement on the part of the government of drug use as a whole.
You're basically giving them the tools by which they can inject and this is an implicit suggestion that you are accepting what they are doing because otherwise you would do something to prevent it or at least like say that it is bad.
But we think that normalizing drug use for the general populace is always going to be bad, right?
So first, automatically this does normalize the use of drugs in so far as now I'm just going to see a lot more people going in and out of these buildings and coming out with like needles, I'm going to see advertisements for this, I'm going to be taking a bit out of my taxes in order to give you these kinds of programs, and it basically says look, this is a societal thing that is going to exist and that its cemented in its place.
We think this is bad because it basically admits that there is no way to completely get rid of it, which we think is what we ought be striving for at all times.
But more than this, we just don't think that you want to give people easier access to start their drug habits because we think that it's a that the way in calculus for whether I'm going to do drugs gets a lot easier if you know that you're going to have access to clean needles and that your health risk is less.
Like a lot of the time we think that people who are considering trying their first time, they also consider the health risks associated and decide whether or not it's worth it.
So when you decrease the associated health risks, we think you also decrease the barrier that people have to cross in order to start doing drugs in the first place.
Our secondary of clash has to do with expenses.
First, we think that the taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for other individual preventable actions, especially when they're illegal.
So basically in the same way that you wouldn't expect me to pay the bail of criminals who aren't related to me, you ought not expect me to pay for the needles of people who are doing an illegal action that I myself do not participate in it.
Because not only do I not benefit off of it myself at all, unlike things like public parks and road services, but it's also something that is actively illegal and detrimental to the rest of society.
So you're having me fund a detriment.
But these costs are very high and so we think that things like taxes would go up dramatically paying for facilities and regular needles which would be a consistent cost.
But also these areas would require things like increased policing, because if you're going to have large amounts of drug addicts marching back and forth, you're going to have a much higher risk of violence occurring because where there are angry drug addicts who want to get high, you also have people much more loose with their fists.
So given that they're going to be all of these extra costs, we think that it is incredibly expensive for the individual taxpayer which is unjust, but also that this money could be used for better programs that could be more helpful for the majority of society.
So things like stopping food deserts, things like funding reproductive health care, or even like more simple things like food banks.
More than this though, we think that the that these kind of needle exchange programs lead to ghettoization.
You're basically putting a critical mass of drug addict addicts in a concentrated area.
Not only does this mean that people generally don't want to be around large amounts of drug addicts, so what it does is that it decreases things like property values, and increases violence in that areas in that area.
So what you have on their side of the house is essentially large swaths of land that become overcome by these needle exchange programs and stop being productive for the rest of society.
We think that this ought not be propagated and so you should not allow an alley by which it can occur.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish intelligence tests.
Two main areas of clash, the first on why these tests are fake.
First recognize that any test result on the intelligence test changes based on your daily like feeling and very arbitrary daily factors, like maybe you were sick that day.
Studies have shown that you are likely to perform x times worse than had you been healthy and given that there's never a world in which we can make sure that every child or every adult like every individual is able to take the intelligence test under the same conditions and personal conditions, we don't think we should be relying on such an arbitrary test.
Second though, recognize that intelligence tests only show a number but do not showcase the actual potential skill of an individual because even if you are incredibly intelligent that doesn't matter if you're not able to motivate yourself or if you're unable to like force or like learn that material or access that material.
So we also think then that it prevents self-motivation and striving.
Numbers are inherently limiting.
There are two worlds in this debate.
The first is one one which the child gets a high score in which we think they're still harm because it promotes laziness on their behalf and they don't feel like they have to work for something because they're not really intelligent and they think that should compensate.
But then there's another child who gets a lower score and we think the problem here is that once you find out that you are not truly unintelligent you surrender yourself to that biological function and don't consider yourself capable of doing better than you have been.
And we think this is really bad because it prevents you from being able to try harder because it doesn't seem worth it.
But we also think that there's just not meaningful predictors of success in the first place.
A high IQ score is not enough to succeed.
You need to be able to have the education, motivate yourself, etcetera.
But people still end up making assumptions and so we need to let children develop on their own regardless of other people's expectations and that can only be achieved in a world in which those people don't know the child's number, and we think it's a better world when no one knows it.
But finally under this point we think it ruins self-esteem because kids who find out that they have low scores oftentimes end up feeling very sadly about themselves, they feel inadequate, and they feel like they can't compete with other classmates.
Meanwhile it also ruins the esteem in a different way of those who get a very high score in that it overblows the their egos and allows them to think that they are better than others or better than their classmates and so it affects the way that they interactive others they're also they're are always going to do so in a more snobby or hurtful way.
Our second area of clash is about stopping the use specifically in schools, where it is incredibly widespread right now.
Oftentimes there are like programs and specific it's the barrier for like specific groups for children that are called often gifted or talented or enrichment or similar things in which kids don't get in which kids have to take an IQ test and if their IQ tests meets a certain barrier they're granted access.
And when kids take this exam and don't get granted access, they often feel very poorly about themselves, they question their own intelligence, they're unlikely to trust in themselves and their academics, and it also inspires like light bullying and light discrimination when maybe you got in but you know someone else who didn't and it makes you feel more important than this than them and thus makes you feel justified in abusing or being rude to them.
We also think that there's an effect that IQ tests have when teachers find them up find them out.
A lot of the time they will pay special attention to someone with a high score because they feel like that person is more likely to intake their information in a positive and constructive way and they also often times give up on those who had lower scores because they feel like they they're going to waste their time anyway because these students are inherently limited by the score that they received.
We think this is bad signaling to the student and we also think it prevents them from getting the right attention that they deserve and so don't allow intelligence tests any longer."
"We should ban piercings and tattoos for minors.
Two main areas of clash, first on minimizing risk.
We think that it is infinitely more likely for a minor to run into long term issues when getting a piercing or a tattoo than an adult.
This happens we think for physiological reasons just the fact that like the skin of a minor and like the body of a minor is often more sensitive to a lot of reactants, we don't know the allergies yet completely like we think the burden on opposition is always going to have to be to show that this is so important to a minor that they can't just wait a few years to do it like if I'm like we think that there's always going to be a world in which eleven year olds try to get piercings and tattoos and we think that there's always a unilateral reason as to why they shouldn't.
And we think there's always going to be a world in which seventeen year olds are going to want to do it and even though it is technically harmful we think that an arbitrary line has to be drawn somewhere to protect those who are younger.
So we think it's fine to say that like hey sixteen year old who really wants a tattoo or piercing you have to wait two years and we think that's fine and insofar as it protects individuals who may be not as mature or may genuinely be a lot younger.
So we think that like there's never going to be a world in which this is this one thing is like so integral to one person's identity that it outweighs the entirety of the population or the entirety of other individuals and how that can affect them poorly.
We think like simple things like infections sun exposure like we think generally children are a lot less responsible than adults and are a lot less likely to care for their piercings and tattoos so there are a lot more likely to go out without covering their tattoo when they first got it they're going to forget to clean their piercings and what happens then is that all of these impacts are amplified like insofar as their reliance on the parent to take care of them and parents are also often unreliable we're unclear on why such a big burden ought be put on a minor.
Like it it seems reasonable to expect someone to be able to take care of themselves before you have them get like get body alterations that require taking care of.
We also think the problem is that children always end up that they're of like regional tattoo salons that have their own individual rules on what age groups that are willing to take so the majority of the reputable places are actually incredibly averse to ever having minors even if you live in an area that allows minors to get piercings and tattoos.
This means that minors are always accessing the areas that are less safe less secure less likely to be changing their needles regularly so on so forth just due to this like general discrimination that exists so we'd rather have a blanket ban that prevents them from accessing any area regardless of how shady it is.
We think the other issue is that like a lot of the time in the status quo it is the case that parents don't want minors to get those tattoos and we think what happens is that minors do it anyway just because they're feeling rebellious and so we think that insofar as like the state has recognized that parents have a certain right to mold the way that their child grows up up until the point that they are an adult we think that it is a good legal standard to extend that to piercings and tattoos insofar as it extends to literally every other aspect of a child's life.
Our second area of clash is about poor decision making because even though like the argument that someone might regret it often rings false this is one of the few situations in which it actually exists.
Recognize that the problem with minors is that they are very very young and have very few world experiences to contextualize their life in.
The the like role of a high school or middle school is not the pressures incentives and people that you will be encountering the rest of your life so your like desk mate wanting to get a piercing isn't going to be what you value the most once you're released into the real world.
We think the problem on their side of the house is that consent into these kinds of situations and a lack of regret can only happen when someone is able to weigh between the pros and cons in a reasonable manner and we think that minors just don't have the experiences to do that they don't have to contextualization of that the narrow realm of experience and with changing minds and changing bodies like we think the important thing to note here is that teenagers for a really good reason are known to be more volatile than any other population so it's unclear why we ought not be protecting them from their selves when we do it in every other regard.
Proud to propose."
"We should limit the exploitation of natural resources.
In order to model this debate a little bit what we mean is that we would do things like make a compile a list of natural resources.
This would include things ranging from oil, gas, but also hitting more common goods like lumber and things like that, and we would create essentially tradable permits up to a max cap of how many natural resources we think should be used which could be decided up upon by like an environmental commission, or a group of knowledgeable individuals who know about like the state of our nation environmentally and how many environmental resources we ought be using.
Then we would leave it up to those countries to trade those those corporations to trade the environmental resources as they need and do like what they want from then on.
So two main arguments, first on encouraging innovation.
Recognize that when you create a financial incentive to be sustainable since you won't have to buy more permits for the use of resources on and thus save money for your company, or you'd have to continue to spend money on that, so it's like always preferable essentially on our side of the house for a company to say: "" hmmm I'm gonna cut down on my use of resources because it's going to be cheaper and could even be profitable to me if I choose to sell my permit. ""
This is the only incentive that corporations respond to.
Since they don't actually care about things like the long term outcomes of the environment.
They are profit driven entities that care only about the short term.
And even if gov op makes the argument that some individuals within corporations care, we don't think this is a phenomena you can rely on.
Like just historically, based on corporate actions, there's been very very little care for the way that they treat natural resources and majority just an attempt to get as many profits from those resources as possible while they as they can.
This is why we need things like government intervention when it comes to protection of our natural resources.
And we think that all of these actions in technology to protect these natural resources are completely possible.
It's it's just about doing the research and development to get there.
Things like hydroponics and other forms of indoor agriculture, lab grown meat, green technology that reduces emissions and decreases carbon use, all of these things exist in the status quo or the research to create them exists in the status quo.
Is just about companies having an incentive that is financial and motivating to actually accomplish this.
And recognize that this innovation besides just being good for the environment and good for like natural resources as a whole also has a lot of flow over benefits.
For example it can do things that create jobs, on as we have more need for researchers and more need for lab tax and more need for the people who transport these kinds of goods.
It can also open up new spaces in the market for independent companies that actually focus on this.
And this being like the protection of natural resources and technologies that cut down on our use of natural resources.
Because in the status quo there isn't a demand for those kind of companies to exist.
They aren't profitable and they're very risky.
But if you show that companies have a need for them, it's much like the need for consulting companies.
Like it it'll happen.
Right?
In the status quo you have entire companies devoted to consulting and coming in and demonstrating efficiency.
We think the same thing is likely to happen with companies that can do things to decrease the amount of your permits that you are using so you don't have to spend as much money.
Our second argument is about protecting the environment.
We think this is just something that is always going to be true.
We don't think that op would be smart to argue with this because it's literally just a fact claim.
Like we need to start making the environment more of a priority because in the status quo the situation is becoming worse and worse.
You do have the issue of not being able to like grow crops in the same way because of changing weather patterns, you have diseases in places they never existed before, and we think this is a really good way of starting this process because it doesn't cut companies off cold turkey and it allows them to decide where they want to be sustainable.
So you don't make companies really angry, you don't risk the economic harms that I'm sure op will bring up about companies fleeing, because this isn't difficult for those companies.
It's just about how we're going to treat a problem we're going to have to deal with eventually.
Proud to propose."
"We should privatize the postal service.
The model for this is fairly simple.
The government writes up a contract and sells it to the highest bidder and we think that the government can like include whatever it wants in that.
Like we can maintain having set rates based on weight, we can maintain the differentiation between like regular mail versus first class mail, like whatever we think is important about the postal service that the government provides in the status quo, we think we can incorporate into these new contracts.
The important part here is that we need to recognize what exactly the postal service is.
It was meant originally to send letters and make money off of first class classification.
We recognize that even back then most parcels were mailed through third party private companies like fedex or UPS.
But we don't send letters anymore and especially not first class.
So the amount of people who actually use US PS is considerably smaller.
It has gotten to the point where the government loses money on postal service which makes it not worth continuing.
Two main arguments: first on saving government money.
Remember that government money is really just taxpayer money.
It's important to make sure that money is being used in the most efficient manner to provide the most good for the people because otherwise we might as well just leave it in individual pockets so they can decide how to distribute it themselves because they can be the arbiters of their own good at the point that the government is failing.
This means it's pretty much the obligation of the government to make sure that those duties that can be outsourced to private companies get outsourced otherwise they're just spending money unnecessarily because they're too lazy to outsource that labor.
There is no adverse effect to outsourcing the postal service.
There is nothing that the government can do better when it comes to mail delivery.
They can still set the base price for letters and packages.
They could still make sure that every address gets delivered to.
It is opposition's job to show where the unique benefit of the government being the one who owns it comes from.
We don't think it exists.
Not spending that money on the postal service anymore means that money can go in other better places like food stamps or other social safety nets.
Providing for aspects of our society that are actually lacking because recognize that we already see that UPS, fedex, other companies are perfectly capable of taking over the postal services on their own insofar as they've already effectively done so when it comes to like delivering packages so the infrastructure even already exists.
It's just about the government recognizing when it is time for it to check out and allow other people to do the heavy lifting.
Meanwhile that money can benefit people a lot more than getting mail ever will in that it can go towards providing food for people who don't have enough of it, in that it can go to providing healthcare for people who don't achieve it, and all of these are just much larger impacts and needs than having your mail through the government.
Our second argument is about creating more efficient mail services.
The government is clearly incapable of managing any of the changes the post office would need to implement in order to be profitable.
This is because all of the business changes have to go through congress and congress is famous for not being able to get anything done.
Postal services also aren't a particularly hot button topic or something that a lot of people are rallying on either side of.
Democrats side with unions and so don't get don't want to make any changes while republicans don't want to anger the general public when the US PS has to fire some people to become more efficient.
This just result in nothing ever ever getting streamlined when it comes to the postal service.
Clearly these kinds of business decisions need a group of actual experts to manage them rather than a bunch of politicians who are going to be influenced by things other than just what is best for efficiency.
Other countries have privatized their postal service and it's been a really good thing for innovation and efficiency.
People are able to get their packages quickly and cheaply but services also expand more and people get more customizable options like delivery lockers that deutsche post has and other similar things.
Private companies compete in a way that the government doesn't when it monopolizes the postal services and that competition is what drives innovation.
We think because of all this, proud to propose."
"We should criminalize blasphemy.
So to be abundantly clear in this debate we wanna make a distinction between criticism of religion and blasphemy and blaspheme.
So we think that blasphemy is not necessarily criticizing religion but it's denouncing the fact that the religion exists.
Denouncing the beliefs and denouncing holders of those views, and saying that the religion itself is fundamentally problematic.
That the religion itself is fundamentally a bad thing.
It's not necessarily saying that certain tenants of religion may be problematic or that certain tenants religion, we don't wanna prohibit theological discussion because we think that faith only grows with more theological discussion, but essentially critical views, views that are critical of the holding of religion itself, we would criminalize those views.
Okay.
So, two reasons why we think that blasphemy needs to be prohibited: the first is we're going to talk about the purpose of faith and why it's so crucial.
Recognize that faith, no matter what faith one may hold, is essentially it means of achieving spiritual peace.
We recognize the world that we live in is essentially a nihilist world.
There is no, from any sort of natural way, meaning derived upon our existence which means that nature and the state of existence, biology, science, are never going to be enough to dictate answers to questions that exist such as why should we be here, why should we exist and what good acts should I serve?
We think that religion is able to fill that void within humanity.
When people are able to have a faith and are able to hold their faith, they're able to come to some sort of peace about these questions.
Faith dictates to individuals what is morally right and wrong, which helps to answer quandaries that simply do not have a right answer in an objective sense.
It also allows for people to have an understanding of how they should live their life, what the purpose of their life is, and more importantly at the end of it, it gives them a sense of security over the after life.
The most tantalizing and curious thing about human life itself is death, is what happens after death and religion allows for people to come to peace with that.
We think without religion people have much less security in their being and security in their life which makes them ultimately more nihilist in their existence and more depressed in their existence.
So we think that religion plays a crucial role in the ability for people to have utility in their lives.
To fulfill themselves in a meaningful way outside of just the physical world.
We don't think that religion itself is an exclusive ideology.
So we don't think that religion itself necessarily excludes logic and understanding of things outside of the world.
For example, the pope came out and said that evolution can be concurrent with god.
Its way that we come to understand god.
So we don't think that religion itself excludes people from having critical thinking, it only allows them to answer questions that are beyond the scope of their critical thinking.
So with that in mind, we think that blaspheme is essentially hate speech.
Blasphemy is not just a criticism, but hate.
For example, when you see people like richard dawkins who demonize all religions as hateful, as problematic, as trying to spew anger at the world, which is simply not how religion actually functions.
They take extremism and they take extremist views and they perpetuate those as the mainstream, and it criticizes people for things that are beyond their control.
We think that this is unfair and we think it's essentially an attack on the person in the same way that people are attacked for their immutable characteristics.
Whether it be gender or whether it be race.
People can also be attacked for the religious views they hold and in many ways these religious views aren't things that you choose.
It's something that comes to you from a sign of god when it comes to you through a a deeply developed faith that you've had since you're very youngest point, since you were a child and in this way it's something that is very hard to discard through voluntary effort.
So we think that essentially when you blaspheme, when you say hatred towards religion in general, when you say hatred and you spew hatred about religion you're attacking a person's individual self.
People shouldn't have to experience hatred simply because their religion may be illogical, or because people that practice their religion do bad things in other areas.
We don't think that people who are muslim should face the wrath that is attacked and sent towards extremists and we don't think that this should be the case for any other religion.
While criticism is good for public discourse and theological discussion is important, we don't think blasphemy serves any public good and for this reason we should criminalize blasphemy."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban genetically modified crops.
We're gonna model this as we would allow the research and we would allow special waivers for the production of genetically modified crops if it is for the purpose of research but would ban the sale and production of genetically modified crops.
Three main areas of clash, first on preventing ownership over the crops and their future.
Currently GMO's are controlled by corporations and this isn't something that is ever going to change insofar as this is like largely a corporate interest something that they see as like being able to make a lot of money off of then we've already established like the initial patents that solidifies these monopolies and when they own the patents and they own the seeds they don't allow farmers to breed and select their own plants.
This first of all we think blatantly encroaches on farmers' property rights insofar as like we've already sold this item to them we don't understand why like groups like monsanto get to still control the future production of them.
We think this is a really bad standard of ownership to set where we say that like even after you've sold something then a different group can still claim ownership because of a patent insofar as this like inherently limits things that are often outside of farmers' control.
Like first we'd say that it is necessary to their trade and necessary to farming to be able to control your own seeds.
That's the only way that small farmers can develop and the only way that like anyone besides large factory farms that can afford this can ever grow.
But more than that, we just think that this like is antithetical to a lot of other issues right like if a seed happens to travel on the air and settle into a farmer's land with non GMO non monsanto crops now monsanto can still claim ownership of them because it's its seeds have crossed pollenated with them and we think that's really dangerous because this isn't something that people ever actually controlled.
But we also think that it means that if these kinds of that you can run the small farms out of business entirely because they can't afford the same seeds that grow more quickly like recognize that these kind of GMO crops are always more efficient like this is just true to the point where it's like always market preferable to grow them.
The problem is that they're also quite expensive because of the patents that we are worried about and so small farms can never compete which is bad for the economy and bad for anyone who doesn't want to eat GMO food.
It's also really bad for efficiency.
Farmers are really good at selecting seeds generationally to be best for their environment.
Groups like monsanto may have all the scientists in the world but they can't specialize their seeds between regions like it's really different what's going to grow well in new mexico versus new england and the only way that you can control that generationally and control that evolution is if you are capable of replanting the seeds that have grown the best in the past.
Our second area of clash is about how it's bad for the environment.
GMO crops are created to be pesticide resistance this encourages the use of pesticides because you know it's not going to kill off your actual crop so you use it in order to in order to like kill off anything extra and like you're able to use even more of it and make sure that nothing extra grows because they're resistant.
This is really bad because it drians into your water, poisons other crops, all of that and like that's bad both for like any other crops that might grow there but also bad for the groundwater that we then need to be able to drink and needs to be able to feed the rest of like animals and other plants.
So we think that that's really damaging.
Our third area of clash is about allowing research and development.
GMO's have the potential to be incredibly helpful to tons of people economically and nutritiously, but releasing them early as they are developed does two things.
First it begs political outrage.
Religious groups throw fits about it being ungodly, paranoid health freaks worry about potential health effects, and because we don't have the research fully developed we don't have any way of definitively saying look here are the millions of studies we've conducted that have shown that there's no damage.
This creates groups that can lobby against funding for research, that can stymy any kind of small groups that want to look into this and that's really bad but the second thing it does is that it prevents the best research from occurring.
Monopolies establish themselves, dominate the market, and disincentivize any small research group from doing anything because they already know they're not going to be able to make as much money of it and they're not going to be able to compete with the patent law.
We think we need to give these groups a chance and give GMO's a real chance.
Proud to propose."
"We should adopt socialism because socialism is fantastic on a moral level and on an economic level.
So let's start by talking about what socialism in most forms actually looks like.
And by and large it's classified as extensive public support networks, and making sure that basic goods and services are available to everyone in a really equitable fashion.
So this looks like things like social security, like intensive pension plans, strong labor unions so they can advocate for workers rights, universal healthcare, maybe even universal basic income.
These kinds of policies that would fall under the umbrella of socialism basically.
So why are these things good?
So first and foremost most of these things are just things that people should have a right to you and are necessary to people's lives.
When you're talking about something like healthcare, you look at places like america, which are one of the only developed countries in the world that doesn't guarantee access to healthcare or have some kind of public option.
You look at things like the ability of people to stay alive, the ability of people to literally be healthy and be happy is something that comes with an exorbitant price tag.
And even if it's not from like a market perspective, something that's like efficient, obviously this is something that's so important to the like basic human happiness that it's something that you want to try to guarantee access for.
You know, we guarantee a lot of rights in a lot of parts in places like america.
You have a right to freedom of speech, you have the right to vote, you have a lot of rights.
Right to religion.
But rights to things like healthcare, rights to financial security, these kinds of things are far more important in a lot of ways.
You could live without a right to religion.
You could live with that.
But you can't live if you're dying because you don't have the ability to stay healthy, because you can't afford medicine.
You're not going to be able to meaningfully access your right to freedom of speech if you're like constantly working and you don't have the ability to actually speak out politically, because there's a fear of political consequences of speaking out.
You're not going to be able to take advantage of a whole lot of like basic level things of happiness in life.
And there is a whole lot more to life than simply just like living for your job, living for work and things like that.
And I think that socialism makes it possible so that people can actually be comfortable in the lives of their living because they don't have to worry about putting food on the table and starving or having their kids being starving.
They don't have to worry about being homeless, you don't have to worry about these kinds of things because the state provides it for them.
And beyond that, sure, there might be some levels of inequality.
There might be some people who have more luxuries than other people, but in terms of the ability to actually survive on a day to day basis, that's something that I think that everyone just morally has an equal claim to.
So socialism should be adopted for for those reasons.
But beyond that it's good for the economy too.
When people are when people have more money they can fuel consumption.
Rich people by and large just kind of like park their money in bank accounts or in investments or upgrade things and aren't upgrade goods, so like instead of a toyota you got like a maserati or something.
So you're not really creating new consumption and it's more of transferable consumption or no consumption at all.
And that's good because economies are primarily driven by the consumption of goods and services.
So we get more of that through socialism and more purchasing power.
But also there's just gonna be more research development and innovation and more creativity.
Because you're going to have more people in the work in qualified workers, you're going to have more educated workers, and more people that are able to participate in the economy.
In the same way in which like there is a huge economic gains when women were able to participate in the workforce, right now a lot of poor people are locked into certain kinds of jobs because they can't get access to certain kinds of training and education to get out of it.
And that gets solved with socialism.
So for all those reasons, adopt socialism."
"We should ban homeopathy, because it at the end of the day just hurts people, it hurts people because it discourages real treatment, and it discourages access, or seeking out real treatment in place of fake treatment.
So, obviously the government should ban them on those grounds.
So, let's talk about that: what is a good standard?
What should the government be thinking about when it decides if it wants to ban something?
There's three things that come to mind for me: first, does this hurt people?
Second, are there any benefits that could possibly counterbalance the fact that this hurts people?
And third, even if it hurts people, or doesn't help people all that much, is this a choice that people can make accurately and consent into, is there coercion involved, things like that.
Am homeopathy has problems with all three of these rather basic paradigms.
So, let's go into that a little bit more.
So first, as far as the harms are concerned, homeopathy obviously has no real scientific value, but it has harms, in that it could possibly for example, the treatments they are getting themselves can be harmful, you can get more sick as a result of the homeopathic treatment, or at the very least, the homeopathic treatment is happening in absence of scientifically proven treatment, or am actually well tested treatment.
So, even if the homeopathy itself doesn't make you less healthy, which it might, it certainly isn't going to make you more healthy, which is net loss if you are sick, because if you're unhealthy that means you're just going to be staying unhealthy, and that's obviously a very big harm.
So homeopathy is bad for that.
Am, but, additionally there's no benefits to counterbalance this.
Maybe if homeopathy was proven to work for some people, am in of itself, that would be worth it, but it's not.
There's been extensive scientific testing on this, and there's no real proof that homeopathy actually helps people, any more than a placebo effect otherwise would.
So, there's no real reason why we should accept the fact that this does harm people, and we discourage people from getting real treatment.
But, the final part about this is about can people make this choice, and I think that this is uniquely bad, because if this is true, then you're essentially seeing people getting coerced into picking a treatment that, we know doesn't work, am and why?
And the reason for this is they think because it's cheaper, fake medicine is usually cheaper than real medicine, real medicine costs money to produce, it costs more money to research and develop, it has to go through more extensive testing, there's reasons why medical care is oftentimes expensive.
So people may feel, especially if you're financially disadvantaged, you may see this as a viable treatment option, something that could fit your financial needs more so.
But that's bad, because I think that the focus should be on enabling access for people for real treatment, it to be enabling access to real treatment, rather than am making it so, that people feel pressured into picking fake treatment, ultimately getting sick and dying anyway.
Obviously that's very bad.
But don't think that that's obviously something that this would be first choice, I think most people's first choice would be the more accepted in sound medicine, because people want to be healthy, people are going to want to pick those things.
Am but, the final thing is that, people also may be coerced into picking this, because it may be easier, oftentimes undergoing, whether it's taking possible cocktails of drugs, that could impact your mind in a different ways, or impact your mood, impact your health, or eating habits, am possibly having to undergo something like like chemotherapy can lead to harmful side effects, amm oftentimes drugs can't get mixed and mashed together very well, there's all kinds of things that can happen.
There's all kinds of reasons why homeopathic treatment may strike someone as an easier route to go under, and that's something that people want to believe, on a very basic level, they want to believe that it's going to work, but belief in something working doesn't mean that it's actually going to work, in the same way that believing global warming is a myth doesn't mean that everyone isn't going to be fucked in a few years.
So it's very important to recognize this, because this is a perfect scenario for which you should ban something.
Homeopathy only hurt people, it doesn't help anyone, and people can't even reasonably pick if this is right for them, because they're probably going to be pressured or coerced into take taking this, because they feel that this is an easier way out of a big problem for them, or even more perniciously, they feel that they can't afford, there's no real affordable option for alternatives, so they see this as cheaper.
That's not very good, you need to have better options for people, and in light of that you should ban homeopathy"
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should reform the teacher tenure system.
For the sake of this debate I'll be modeling it as the reform just being abolished, the teacher tenure system so we just wouldn't have tenure anymore.
We're not going to change anything else.
So three independent points.
First is that the restrictions that are generated by tenure keep bad teachers in place.
So I think the reasoning for why this happens is fairly intuitive, that is that you know generally the incentive of an individual school is to fire teachers that are underperforming and you know replace them with teachers that you know might be better basically.
I think the problem then that's generated by tenure is that teachers you know that are doing well over you know the first period of their teaching career don't necessarily stay that way.
I think you know there's lots of examples that people can just personally relate to seeing in their own school system but also like from a logical perspective it just makes sense like sometimes people just get worse at their jobs as they age especially when that job is like a very high stress one that involves dealing with like loud rambunctious often disobedient children so you know as people reach into their twilight years they just might not be as good at the job and I think at that point it is reasonable to replace them with someone that is better.
I think then like so maybe like op is going to get up here and be like that so inhuman like you can't just like take someone's job away from them when they're in their fifties.
I think I'm willing though to put like a different standard on schools because the impact of like the quality of the teaching is pretty high like having a good teacher verses like an unadequate teacher means a massive amount of the development of it in of tons and tons of children that pass through that teacher's classroom.
So at the point where there is a profound impact on young children as a result of these hiring policies, I'm willing to take the stance that we should adopt whatever the policy is that ensures the best quality teaching.
Our second independent point is that the tenure system is extremely costly.
So the way this works in a lot of cities for example is that if the teacher doesn't get hired in a given year that is if the school decides we don't want them anymore we're just like not going to hire them they can do that.
It it's a complicated process that involves expending a lot of political capital with the union but they can do that.
However what happens is that the teacher doesn't just like go away like they still get paid and if they can't find another school to work out then they just basically sit in these things called like teacher detention rooms new york is notorious for having like large ones that lots of teachers wind up in and they get paid to do essentially nothing.
So this is obviously pretty problematic like this is a huge drain on the school budget that in most cities is pretty underfunded and even if it's not underfunded there's always better things to spend that money on than paying teachers to sit around in a room.
Like you could buy new classroom supplies, you could buy new technology to run these classrooms on, new gym equipment, any number of things.
You could bring down the classroom size by just hiring better teachers.
Any number of things that you could do with this money but instead it's going to what is a pretty objectively bad use of it.
Our third independent point is that it affords a lot of political cow capital to unions that then proceed to often abuse that political capital.
So the reason why this accrues so much political capital to the union is that they are responsible for they're essentially the gatekeepers to the tenure system.
So this puts the teachers pretty much in their pocket.
A large part of the staff at these schools are then you know affording their loyalty to the union by virtue of the fact that they are the ones ensuring a strong protection is kept inplace.
This is a problem though because the unions' incentives generally don't align with the incentives of children and things like that.
They align with teachers' incentives.
Often these overlap but often they don't.
Often teachers want extremely high pay and like generous pack like like generous employment benefits packages that just don't allign with the best interests of the students because there's better ways to spend that money.
And when the tenure system allows so much loyalty to the union, the union then has better leverage within the district and that then increases their capacity to engage in abusive tactics.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should make assisted suicide a criminal offense.
Three main areas of clash: first, on maintaining legal standards.
Because regardless of what we call assisted suicide, it is murder.
You are taking the life of someone else.
And whether or not it was by their permission, it's still extinguishing someone's life.
In the real world, when it's not administered by a doctor even if that person asked you to kill them, it would still be considered murder.
And we don't think that anything changes just because you put them into a hospital and dress it up pretty.
We think that it's important to treat it exactly as it is because it has to do with the maintenance of criminal justice.
Otherwise you're devaluing human life, saying that in certain instances it's okay to take it away.
And this is a really dangerous door to open because if you're allowing justifications for this, it obviously allows the space for more justifications in the future.
Some things just have to be basically true and not something you can ever pass otherwise you enter a world in which other people can use their own moral systems to come up with their own rules and guidelines.
We also think that this signaling is really really bad.
You don't want a world in which it looks like the government condones something like committing suicide.
We think on net you end up in a world where you normalize this practice, and more people are going to be relying on a on suicide as an option than in the status quo, where it's something heavily looked down on, heavily looked at as a last option, and not condoned by the government.
Our second area of clash has to do with the lack of consent.
Because when you're really really sick you often might feel useless or like a burden on a family, then even if your family isn't trying to pressure you, oftentimes people put pressure on themselves.
They feel guilty for being an economic burden or for making people sad.
And at the point that you have this kind of pressure surrounding you we don't think that you can meaningfully consent to taking your own life.
Given that you aren't actually incentivized only by this concept of like wanting to be gone, but rather you're incentivized by the emotions of other people.
And if any decision should be made only by yourself, we think it should be one in which you take your own life.
We also think there's another layer here though, because we think the person that you are today isn't necessarily the person that you're going to be in a year, two years, or in this situation the span of a lifetime.
We don't think that you can make this decision for your future self because it is so permanent.
Like obviously sometimes I make decisions for my future self when I sign a lease or when I sign any kind of contract with like an institution, but in this situation you're literally signing away the rest of your life and that is incredibly dangerous.
Because you don't know where you're going to be twenty five years from now.
Even if you might not live that long, you don't know where you'll be a year from now.
We think that a lot of the time really miraculous things happen.
And just because you think that something is the end doesn't necessarily mean that it really is.
Our third area of clash is about de-incentivizing assisted suicide and how by de-incentivizing it, you incentivize seeking help.
We think that right off the bat you want to make it as hard as possible for someone to commit suicide.
Given that it is a permanent solution and oftentimes to a temporary problem.
Especially in situations of chronic depression.
This problem is one that can be treated, that can be worked around.
And even in terms of physical illness there can be last minute solutions, or like illnesses can like suddenly disappear, new treatments can come out.
And we think that really you have to exhaust every single option before you're willing to give yourself up.
And given that it can be a permanent mistake we'd rather make it as hard as possible.
We think a lot of the time people feel desperate and out of options, at times even when they aren't, you and even when they're you don't want to make it easier to stay in that head space and to say that it would be okay to commit suicide.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"The motion for this debate is that we should ban boxing.
Two main areas of clash: the first on the danger to competitors.
We think that you need to paternalize boxers from being able to participate in this and like children who are thinking of being boxers from participating in this activity because society glamorize athletics and physical strength and oftentimes especially for boys glamorizes the associated violence and the associated domination that occurs during boxing.
So at the point that we don't think that people can resist the societal impulses on their own, we think it is necessary for the government to step in and say look this is too dangerous here are the reasons why we are not allowing it anymore.
So first into this is that athletes have a very short shelf life.
So after about ten years their bodies begin to give out but because they've dedicated so much of their lives to this activity there really isn't anything else for them to do.
So what happens is that you basically have someone who spent a solid twenty years of their lives training for this activity, becoming a professional boxer, spent six years in the boxing ring, and then after that has no more marketable skills because physically they can't do anything but also all the time that they spent training in the gym was time they didn't spend learning a different marketable skill.
This means that you actually end up with people who used to be athletes who end up below the poverty line afterwards because they never actually had a real living that they made besides being an athlete.
More than this though we think that physically boxing is incredibly dangerous.
It's the only sport that really involves a accepted and endorsed physical contact through fists.
Recognize that in every other sport such as soccer or basketball there are fouls for elbowing your opponents.
A boxing gets rid of all of that and says go for it.
So you end up with way more broken noses, limbs, necks, and it's also the only sport with a significant death count based on one on impact blow.
So something like thirty people a year die based on one punch in the boxing ring and many more than that die in the boxing ring holistically from more than one punch.
Specifically the use of boxing gloves worsens the situation because the large surface area carries the same initial force as if I was to just punch something but becomes more harmful because of the surface area it covers.
So it literally jiggles the brain by making contacts with more points on your head.
We think that at the point that participants end up with long term physical and mental health problems, that they could not have accounted for, that last far beyond their boxing careers, and end up costing much more than their boxing careers ever afforded them, and they shorten these people's lifespan, it is then okay for us to paternalize them.
But our secondary of clash has to do with why it's bad for society.
We want to talk about why it propagates violent culture.
Because when you watch violence you're essentially normalizing what like what you are looking at, right?
So if every day I spend my time watching people beat each other up I get less surprised the next time it occurs in front of me because it has become so expected.
So in the bobo doll experiment run by skinner, what he did was put put children in a room with a TV where they watched a man beat up a doll and later they were much more likely to mimic this behavior.
We think the same thing occurs when you're watching violent sports such as boxing because when you are a child who's looking at a role models and you're sitting down and you're seeing these big strong men who you aspire to be beating each other up, you're much more likely to go back and mimic this behavior later.
We think that there's an additional layer of harm though, at the point that it turns this activity into entertainment.
In order to maintain people feeling serious about violence, you need to keep a serious aura around it.
So if you make violence into entertainment, you're more likely to end up in situations where people find violence comical and are not actually going to act against it.
And we think that that boxing is specifically unique in this because it doesn't have a second layer to the sport.
There isn't a second goal where you're supposed to kick the ball in, it is completely based on just beating other people up.
For these reasons proud to oppose.
Propose."
"Atheism is the only way.
Now, of course, there are other ways, so we understand this debate to mean that atheism is the only rational way.
Three points in this speech: a, on how faiths and religions answer basic human needs, which make it make it logical to assume they're just a human invention.
B, on scientific discoveries that directly contradict the traditional big religions.
And c, what is the rational way to deal with questions to which we do not know the answer?
First argument: so since ancient times, in order to cope with the fact that there are things that we cannot explain, people made up different stories that try to make sense of everything.
Thousands of years ago people didn't have tools to explain phenomena like day and night, how old is the earth, etcetera.
So they developed theories that made sense to them back then about deities with supernatural powers, and with no alternative explanation, it was very tempting to believe such stories, because just it's much better than remaining clueless as to what's going on.
Another reason why a deity is such a successful theory is that it provides comfort.
It's comforting to know that everything is part of a bigger plan and bad things that happen to you aren't entirely random and are not necessarily your fault, or the the idea of someone almighty that's watching over you.
Another important reason for the development of religions is the need to create social order and a source of legitimacy for moral or social rules that we want to impose upon society.
The ten commandments, for example, are a perfect example of an attempt to create a political foundation for a functioning society.
In every culture the stories and the rules are a little bit different, but there are very similar elements that we can recognize in all of them, like the notion of a chosen people because way back then, leaders understood that in order for people to follow the rules, they need to feel special somehow.
There's also the idea of rewards and punishments.
The deity's watching everything you do and if you misbehave, you'll be severely punished.
This is, of course, a way to maintain control over people.
So, we see that there are many basic human needs and strategic political needs that religions answer for, and this implies that we're dealing with nothing more than a human invention.
Second argument: there are several theories that are widely accepted by the scientific community that can be used as evidence against what religions are saying.
The theory of evolution shows that there's nothing special about the human species, and we weren't created in god's image.
The big bang theory shows that the earth wasn't created in seven days like the bible says, and it's fairly obvious that the earth is more than a few thousand years old, as religions would have us believe.
Just like people wholeheartedly believed that the earth is flat or that the sun revolves around the earth until scientists came and proved otherwise, it would be completely irrational to stick to those beliefs today.
But if we don't only want to talk about religions and we also want to talk about the abstract concept of belief in a deity, and compare atheism to agnosticism or to faith, then the key question is basically: what is the rational approach to deal with questions to which we don't know the answer?
Now a believer will say, "" you just have to believe. ""
But this is, of course, circular logic at its best.
You simply believe what you're being told to believe, and it's totally random.
There's absolutely no good reason to believe what you're believing in.
A more interesting approach is the agnostic one, but the problem with this approach is that it's basically giving up.
It it's they say: okay, there's something I don't know.
Therefore, by definition, I can't ever possibly know this is a logical leap and so, I just avoid the question.
So this is not a rational approach.
Atheists, on the other hand, say: okay, there are things I still don't know, but we're gonna keep checking because the answer is out there and we'll find it out eventually.
We owe this approach pretty much all of the major breakthroughs and discoveries that our species has ever made.
So, for all of these reasons, we say that atheism is the only rational way."
"Marriage is outdated for two overarching reasons.
First, because I think that marriage is just an outdated institution that suppresses general human nature as with regards to sexuality and human pleasure in life, and secondarily, marriage is outdated because it enforces archaic social norms that ultimately just oppress gender minorities like LGBTQ people, or it oppresses women more broadly as an institution.
So those are the reasons why I think marriage is going to be bad.
But before I get into those reasons, I want to I want to clarify what this is a debate is actually about, because I don't think that this is a debate about whether long term monogamous relationships can be good or can make some people happy.
I think that that's something that is probably true, but I think that when we're talking about marriage, we're much more talking about the actual political, legal, religious institutions that enshrined such a way of life.
And this is very important, because I think that as a result of these legal legal, political and institutions and the like, what this does is it creates this as the predominant way of having to live your life.
So it means that what it does is it creates an environment of less choice, and it necessarily coerces or pressures people into living their life in a certain way.
As a result and as a result of this, this really brings me into my first argument, which is about how this lessens human pleasure as a result of sexual interactions.
And I think this is like an incredibly important thing, because like billions of people like in our world billions of people are going to fall in love, billions of people are going to have relationships, and like tons and billions of people are going to get married.
So, whether or not these people are actually happy with their marriages, happy with their relationships and the like is incredibly important, and I think that that this is clearly not true, there's a reason why divorce rates are at all time highs, there's a reason why infidelity is at an all time high, and there's a reason why increasingly younger and younger people aren't even bothering to get married at all.
It's because what I think that it does is marriage suppresses basic human emotions, and that is whether and that is that you want to oftentimes not just be tied down to one person, you want to have different relationships with different people at different stages of your life.
What you may be interested in in in a partner is going to be very different when you're twenty than when you're thirty or when you're sixty or any other age.
And this is important, because you're going to value different things, you're going to value different ways that you connect to people, because you're in a different point in your life emotionally at these different stages in your life.
Sometimes you're going to value attractiveness more than security, you're going to value maybe like intellect, like there's all different ways in which people value different ways, and these things are never constant because people just change over time.
And this is very important, because the human desire for excitement, the human desire for love, all of these things aren't just things that exist when you're in your twenties, which is when you're supposed to get married in a in like contemporary societies or things like not more like historical societies.
These are things that are experienced throughout human life.
So, I think that being forced down to one partner throughout most of your adult life is definitely going to take away a valuable part of human experience and pleasure and happiness.
But I also think that this is oppressive socially.
I think that it's quite obvious that the institution of marriage, even if we're getting a little bit better about this, albeit with much resistance, is incredibly exclusionary for a lot of gender minorities, people who are gay, people and the like.
It's difficult for them to access the same political protections or legal protections that come as a result of marriage.
But I think that secondarily, marriages has inherently sexist roots.
The root of marriage is this idea of division of labor in that women should you should have marriage, that way men can be the breadwinners of the family unit, and that women should be the ones who are doing the light household work.
And that's really what the point of marriage was, and that's where its religious roots come from.
It was designed to make sure that women would not be able to access a lot of the privileges and benefits that men have, because it would set up society in a way which structurally disadvantages their ability to succeed in the workplace, to succeed in other walks of life, because it creates social expectations that they're going to do a predominance of housework and things like that.
I think that without the institution of marriage, these things become a lot less prevalent.
So, for all those reasons, incredibly proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should subsidize embryonic stem cell research.
These subsidies could take any form: it could be through tax breaks for corporations that are like producing embryonic stem cell research, grant money given directly to groups that promise to pursue embryonic stem cell research, basically any like anything like that, or like even offers of government contracts with companies that are doing embryonic stem cell research.
With that, two main areas of clash: the first on the enormous benefits that embryonic stem cells provide.
Most of the conditions that we currently struggle with can be treated using embryonic stem cells and the kind of cures that they predict.
So, currently, the number one killer in the united states is heart disease, a treatment a a condition that we know can be treated with embryonic stem cells but isn't currently accessible, because of the ethical dilemma surrounding them and the unwillingness of private corporations to engage in it for fear of public reprisal.
So, we think that once you are giving money to these corporations and saying that we are governmentally sanctioning this kind of research, you can actually access those long-term cures, because you decrease the stigma around the research in the first place.
More than this, we think it's important to point out that stem cell treatments are much more long term and cheaper than treatments that we currently use, because a lot of the conditions that we're talking about are chronic pain conditions or currently considered incurable.
So what you have is essentially people going in and spending money on treatment after treatment for diabetes, for heart disease, for arthritis, any of these kinds of things, and big pharma corporations benefiting off of it at the expense of the individual.
But on our side of the house, you're going to be able to spend this money at the beginning to research what these treatments look like, but then they are permanent treatments that get rid of the condition for the long term.
What this means is people who were previously weighed down by chronic pain or chronic conditions and die earlier deaths because you can never actually cure their condition can now have a permanent cure that allows them to be long-term more productive, and also allows them to take that money they were spending on monthly or weekly prescriptions and spend that on other goods that benefit the economy.
More than this, we think that some conditions that are that are that are like currently rising with regards to disease rates, this can be cured much more quickly, and this is the fastest way in which to achieve that cure, because what's going on right now is that because you're having such rising rates of these conditions, it's too much and like drives up the price of medication for these families because there are so many people within the united states who suffer from it.
So we think that once you are able to make a make a cure that can be more permanent, you will actually be able to deal with the rising numbers of people who have these conditions.
We also think that it's good for the economy because it increases the general productivity of people and diverts that spending power from medications to other products.
Our second area of clash has to do with ethics, because we think it's important to address the ethical dilemmas that people have with embryonic stem cells.
A lot of people are worried about the ethical implications of using what what essentially are the pre-stages of like someone becoming a baby.
We think this is silly because it's unclear who's rights you are actually protecting here.
This child does not exist yet and will never exist if not for you trying to prevent people from using the embryo.
We think that none of the standards are actually met.
At the point that this embryo doesn't feel pain, doesn't have a conception of the future, doesn't have any of the associated emotions with understanding that it is an individual being and being upset that it's life is ended, we don't think there is anything that these activists are protecting, because they're protecting something that doesn't even understand it's being protected, but moreover, wouldn't care if you didn't protect it.
So, say a dog might not understand you're protecting it but if it gets killed, it is probably not looking forward to that, given that it enjoys existing.
The difference here is that this thing never enjoyed existing.
But more than this, we think that the people that you're going to be able to protect in the future are much more important, not only because they are already alive, but because they are suffering much more.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"Abstinence only sex education brings more good than harm.
So in this debate we're talking about sex education provided to young people in schools which would teach them to abstain from sex until marriage, it wouldn't include things like condom use or education about birth control methods, it would just be focused on encouraging young people to remain abstinent as a way to avoid pregnancy and STDs.
So with that in mind, we have two related arguments for why we think this is ultimately going to be what's best.
But I think that before we get into that, when you judge this round, the thing that's best is going to be what's best for the young people who receive this type of education.
We what we mean is that the purpose of sex education obviously is to try to reduce unintended pregnancies and to reduce the spread of STDs.
So when you think about this debate, ultimately what we mean by more good than harm is that more young people will be able to avoid unwanted pregnancies, and be able to avoid STDs as a result of this abstinence only sex education.
So two arguments.
The first is that you get more parental support.
We think that in order for sex education to work, you need parents to opt their children into that sex education.
Remember that in many parts of the united states, sex education is opt-in opt-out.
Parents choose whether or not they want their children to go through sex ed.
What that means is that even if you had the best sex ed regime in the world planned that would convince everybody to wear a condom every time they have sex and help all of the girls in the class to get on birth control etcetera, if none of the parents are willing to put their children into that class, then it doesn't help anybody.
You can offer as liberal or radical a regime as you want, but if none of the young people are actually in the room to hear it, then it doesn't do any good.
We think that ultimately, you need to produce something that is acceptable to the parents of the children, because they're the ones making this decision.
Moreover, if the parents tell their children look, what you're hearing is a bunch of liberal nonsense, don't listen to it, then the kids aren't going to listen and they're not going to wear the condom, they're not going to get on birth control, etcetera.
So we see that ultimately, what you really need is a sex ed regime that is acceptable to parents, if you want to help young people.
Our second argument is related but broader, and this is about how abstinence only sex ed reaches communities who would otherwise be excluded from sex education.
So think about communities that are very conservative.
Think about certain muslim communities or certain evangelical protestant communities, mormons, groups like that.
These groups are not going to provide their children with a lot of sexual education, compared to what secular westernized parents might provide their children with.
These kids are much more at risk of not understanding the risks of unintended pregnancy, or understanding how STDs are actually transmitted.
So these are the most vulnerable people in this debate is the children who live in those types of communities.
And these are also communities whose beliefs are antithetical to the idea of comprehensive sex ed.
Which means that even if it will be better in a vacuum if every child received comprehensive sex ed, children from these communities will always be excluded if that's the only type of sex ed that you offer.
We think that you need to be as inclusive as possible to help the most children, and that means offering abstinence only sex education, because it's the only type of sex education that these young people are likely to be allowed to have.
And we tell you that even if the other side gets up here and tells you look, abstinence only sex education doesn't work, young people are going to have sex no matter what you tell them, ultimately this isn't going to be effective, it's certainly better than no sex education.
Recognize that unless somebody is teaching them, many young people aren't going to understand why they have a period, they're not gonna understand how pregnancy works, young men aren't going to understand young women and vice versa.
So at the end of the day, we need to provide some level of sex education and this is the only vehicle that we have to do so.
Thank you."
"We should cancel the national flood insurance.
Three main arguments, first and why this is a poor use of government funds.
First I want to set a burden on side opposition.
Because they're going to have to show why flood insurance is uniquely more important than the insurance for earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, fire or literally any other kind of natural disaster that exists.
And that that unicality needs to be shown because they need to explain why it is more important for the government to provide this when they are clearly not providing those other forms of insurance.
Recognize that the rates at which fire occurs, the rates at which earthquakes occurs and even the rates at which tornadoes occur are oftentimes infinitely higher or at least equal to the rates at which flood occurs.
So if we if the government is not providing coverage for those things we do not think the government ought be providing coverage for floods.
But more over than this, we think this burden is double sided because it is not just that it has to show why it is uniquely more important than those other sorts but it is also important to show why this is more important than the other things that we think the government should be providing instead, which we're going to list now.
Because there is a hierarchy of necessity when it comes to human needs.
And if the government is going to be spending millions of dollars on these kinds of things, we think the government needs to start at the bottom of that pyramid.
This way you can actually make sure that the most important things that are like central to human existence are addressed first since those are causing the worst kinds of harms and suffering.
Food, shelter, education are all more important and under covered significantly because they hurt people a lot more and the risk of them happening or not happening is much higher and much more constant than the once every now and then region dependent flood.
The millions of dollars spent on flood insurance should be used for those other needs because they can actually benefit the people who need things most rather than just being a like risk type of like insurance necessarily protects against risks so it doesn't even guarantee that you're going to have to end up using them, which we think is quite important.
Our second argument is about the government being a poor actor.
First we just think that private corporations do these kinds of things a lot better.
Competition forces the prices to get lower and the services to get better or for there to be a good balance of equilibrium for people who might not be able to afford the top notch service and are okay with compromising on that quality in order to pay less.
The government doesn't have that same kind of competitive threat so there's no incentive to provide good service service at the cheaper prices they want to offer.
So we think that it's just always going to be the case that either the government service is going to be super super cheap and super super super bad or it's going to be more expensive but still not amazing.
Because the government has no incentive to actually make it better.
And also because the government just worrying about other things.
Right?
Like we think there's a set amount of political expenditure and energy that the government has and they're expanding that on those topics that are more important like keeping the country out of war and maintaining political stability.
They're not focusing on making sure that their flood insurance is doing good things.
Which we think is actually quite important.
We also just think it means the government's gonna have super low pay outs because there's no incentive got high payouts so we don't have any reliable in that situation either.
And our third argument is about a lack of accountability.
It's really hard to sue the government if it doesn't deliver or if something goes wrong because literally all of the courts and all of bureaucracy is going to be on their side and they're going to have infinite money in order to fight you.
So sure bringing up lawsuits against big corporations might be hard but at least you're likely to have the government on your side to some extent or you can like rile support.
Like their power isn't as infinite as having to sue the government which we think is a lot harder for people to do.
Proud to propose."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should adopt libertarianism.
Three independent points, but first a quick model.
We would say that this is, you know, something we are adopting in terms of a governmental structure, so specifically a governmental structure that necessitates less involvement of the state into personal affairs.
This means, you know, everything from lower taxes and less regulations all the way down to, you know, less involvement in shaping social policy, like what constitutes marriage.
We'd endure, say, wide array of policies underneath this framework, but broadly we're going to defend the notion that government should just do less essentially, and a private citizen should be making more decisions about what happens to them rather than the government making those decisions for them.
The first independent point that I really just broadly want to establish is why these principles matter, that autonomy, on an individual level, is something that's really, really important.
So, the majority of our constructs of what constitute our rights is derived from autonomy being the principal thing that we care about.
Even something as fundamental as our right to life is only based on the fact that we, you know, have a life where we can make decisions about what happens to us and, you know, what freedoms we have.
That autonomy and that liberty is really fundamental to our entire perception of what constitutes a right.
So this is something that we should always take with, you know, to the the highest extreme essentially, that we always want to establish as much autonomy for the individual as is reasonably possible.
There will always be constraints on that, for example, we shouldn't give them autonomy to murder.
But even then, we would only say that the, you know, the reason that you don't want people to be allowed to murder is so because doing so actually restricts other people's autonomy.
In another sense, what we really want to do is maximize autonomy, on net, for as many people as possible.
I think that, broadly speaking, libertarianism accomplishes that by ensuring that the government has as little a role in people's lives as is possible.
The second point that I want to bring up, though, is that the government is a bad proxy for making these decisions for people.
So I think a lot of the defense that will come out of side opposition in favor of big government will be that, you know, regulations, like food safety regulations and things like that, are effective at ensuring that people are protected from predatory practices and things like that that limit their autonomy by establishing harms upon them.
The problem is that individuals are really the best actors for these things.
They know best.
And when you try to proxy their preferences through bureaucracy, essentially, there's always going to be inefficiencies intrinsic to that, that the bureaucracy just isn't good at figuring out what that individual person wants and isn't in a position to make those decisions intelligently for them.
So this ranges from everything to, you know, regulations being bad, something like, you know, a regulation on a auto producer not being able to put a certain feature in a car or having to wear seat belts, when in reality that's just something that an individual person can decide if they want to buy something with seat belts or not based on their personal preferences.
But also social policy, where the government intervenes into things like gay marriage or trans rights, simply on the basis of the the social mores of the society around them, but in reality, this isn't something that society should be deciding.
This is something that the individual should be deciding insofar as it most directly affects them.
So we would say that when these regulations come down from the upper level at the government, that's necessarily problematic.
The third and final point I want to make very briefly is just that people really, at a principled level, should be responsible for themselves.
I don't think that there's a positive obligation for an individual to support another through redistributive economics, for example.
And the reason for this is that, you know, we derive our, you know, our humanity and our and our sense of worth from the autonomy over our property or things, and because those those that property is facilitative to us being able to, you know, exert our own preferences, I if I want a car, if I want to drive around a lot because that makes me happy, I need the, you know, the money to buy a car.
And I think if we do the work to get that money and if we earn that capital, that property has to belong to us.
It's unjust then when the government takes it away.
Proud to propose."
"International volunteering brings more harm than good.
So what are we talking about in this debate?
International volunteering takes a few different forms, but the one that we have in mind for this debate is one where citizens of a wealthy country travel to a poorer country to volunteer.
So this is really common for instance for americans to go on mission trips from the united states down to central america, places like honduras, and build schools and houses and things like that, and try to help those people by bringing in their skills and resources from the US, to a country like honduras or nicaragua with much lower level of resources and much less human development.
So we have two reasons why we think that these programs bring more harm than good on aggregate.
First, higher costs.
Imagine providing training to people in order to, say, build a school.
You probably have to teach people how to install plumbing and drywall, how to put a roof up, how to build a frame, et cetera.
So it seems like it would always be better to train one local rather than ten tourists in a row.
For instance, if you train one honduran how to build the frame of a school building, he stays in that community and he lives in that town and knows how to build the frame for a large building.
And ultimately he will be able to do much more good than a sequence of americans would, because he's part of that community and he can teach those skills to others, and he'll remain in the area for a long time, and maybe teache his children how to do those skills, and ultimately make the whole community better off because he is now a source of human development, he is a person who has skill who is part of that area and is going to stay there long term.
Versus, a long sequence of visitors who either have to be trained on the spot at his expense, or who bring in these skills but don't pass them along.
Recognize that usually what these visitors do isn't educate locals about how to build a school, they just build the school.
Which means that even if the net result of having this building in places there it would be better to have an individual with that skill to stay in the community and educate others rather than just to bring in a rich american or a rich european who has those skills, and will use them without teaching anyone else.
Remember, if you give someone a fish, they eat for a day, if you teach them to fish, they eat for a lifetime.
So next, we think there's also higher cost because providing for these visitors is going to be more expensive than providing for locals.
Bringing in someone from within your own country for instance to work on building a school, might require a lower level of service them bringing in americans.
If you bring in people from wealthy countries they have certain expectations about quality of life and food and toilet facilities and things like that, it makes it much more expensive to house them and care for them than housing and caring for people who are more used to the standards of this community.
So we think all that money would be better spent on investing in the community rather than making a bunch of american high schoolers more comfortable while they build a house.
Our second point is about promoting harmful narratives.
We think that this voluntourism, brings in the notion that americans and europeans can just fly around the world and solve everybody else's problems.
But this obviously isn't true.
In order to solve problems in the long term, you need solutions from people in the community.
We think that you're less likely to get that if you create these bandaid solutions by bringing in tourist rather than relying on local people.
One reason this has to be true is that, bringing in these foreigners isn't sustainable.
They come, they visit, they stay, maybe they know the language, maybe they don't, and then they leave after a few months or years at the absolute most, and many of them leave sooner.
So this creates a notion that these problems are easy to solve even though they aren't, they're endemic and no one has been able to solve them in the past.
And also it creates a notion by visitors that they've made an enormous change to these people's lives, that those people couldn't make on their own.
We think that this is condescending and promotes this narrative that the visitors are superior to the people that they help.
So at the end of the day, we think that there are higher costs to providing services using these international volunteers, and that it promotes harmful stereotypes and bad narratives.
So for these reasons, it brings more harm than good.
Thank you."
"We should abolish term limits.
By this we mean to say that elected officials should be able to serve as many terms as they can be elected to.
Right now the united states, among other countries, have limits on how many terms people can service the chief executive.
You can't be the president more than twice for instance.
Whereas other liberal democracies like germany, have no such limitations.
Angela merkel is in her I believe fourth term as chancellor of germany right now, and plans to run for a fifth in the upcoming elections.
So we see that there are a liberal democracies that do both.
We think that generally speaking anyone ought be able to serve as many terms as they wish to.
Two arguments for our side: the first is that term limits limit the democratic will unnecessarily.
Now, we tell you that in order to be reelected four times, like angela merkel or franklin roosevelt, ultimately you have to be the kind of leader that appeals to a large group of people.
If you don't have a stable, solid broad power base, you wouldn't be able to keep getting elected over and over again.
So while it may be true that some people are voting against you, ultimately it's clear that a leader who was reelected many times has learned to appeal to most people.
Because the government relies on popular support for its legitimacy, we think that it's important that we don't place barriers in the way of people's expression of their will.
The state is less legitimate if you prevent people from expressing their political preferences.
So ultimately, if people want to elect FDR four times or angela merkel four times, and that is their democratic will, then we need to let them.
Because to do otherwise undermines the legitimacy of the state because it undermines the ability of the people to express their democratic will.
So ultimately we ought defer to that expression and if someone is a bad leader or is abusing the system, we should rely on the election to prevent them from doing so, rather than placing arbitrary limits on how people are allowed to vote, which really just seems like elitist gate keeping more than anything else.
Our second argument is about how this takes away competent leadership.
Many countries around the world have had to suspend elections during times of war.
For instance, britain held no elections during the second world war.
In a country where you have strict term limits and regular requirements for elections, this isn't an option.
The united states had to have presidential elections during our civil war and also the second world war for instance.
We think that, well that's a very drastic example of how this can put your country at risk by dividing you and requiring you to go through difficult elections during a crisis.
Ultimately, you lose out on competent leadership even in peacetime.
If you have someone like angela merkel who has successfully navigated many different crises, such as the euro crisis and the financial meltdown and now the refugee crisis, and people want her to continue to guide germany in the future, that's completely reasonable.
Because they have a leader in place who they see as very competent, who they see is able to adjust these different circumstances in a way that is ultimately good for germany.
So when we prevent someone from running again, if merkel had had to step down after two terms for instance, then you might end up with much worse leadership coming into power because ultimately, the comparative is the unknown.
You have a certain good thing with merkel, if she had had to step down after her second term or if she had to step down now, then we would be getting someone in as the chancellor of germany who might not be able to deal with european politics as efficiently, or who might not be able to respond to the refugee crisis in the same way that people want them to.
So we think that it's likely that the person you would get instead would be a former vice president or assistant, in which case because you see a continuation of influence and policies, the intention of the rule is circumvented.
At that point we might as well just let people run for more terms.
For all these reasons, we should abolish term limits.
Thank you."
"We should subsidize higher education.
Education is a right and not a privilege.
It is absolutely absurd that we stop paying for education at the end of high school.
In our modern day, it is incredibly difficult to live a happy and healthy life at the end of high school.
The total earning potential of someone who only finished high school is not too far off from someone who only finished middle school in terms of the jobs available.
The vast majority of jobs in our modern day, particularly in the united states, are only available to those who have finished their higher education.
Additionally, we think that education is facilitative to a number of other rights, including political speech and living a high quality of life.
To that end, we think that the government of the united states should provide a hundred percent coverage for all individuals who want to go to poverty.
Two arguments why this is a good idea: first, we think this is likely to alleviate poverty.
Why is this the case?
So, in early life, we think that many individuals are disenfranchised because of their inability to go to college.
Why would I work hard in high school when the grades won't be checked if I get a job without a bachelor's degree and there's no opportunity for me to go to college?
It's far more efficacious for me to skim by with d's, work another job in order to develop some human capital, and then go out into the workforce.
Although this is a incredibly sad choice to make, it is a common reality for many individuals who cannot afford college.
However, if were we to provide a hundred percent coverage for college, we think that individuals at an early stage in life are likely to work incredibly hard.
Even if they decide not to go to college, they're far more likely to go to trade school or, at the very least, work harder in high school and at their job in order to develop strong work ethics which will allow them to push themselves further.
The rhetoric of raising yourself up by your bootstraps is impossible when individuals do not even have the basic education that comes from high school, and policies like this are far more likely to increase motivation in high school.
Additionally, though, we think that individuals in poverty are far more likely to be able to access the best colleges possible based on their academic ability.
It's incredibly unfortunate that someone who gets into a top-tier school can't go there because they simply cannot afford it.
Many individuals are pushed into programs that they do not like as much or don't feel as motivated about because they cannot afford the best education that was offered to them.
Covering college one hundred percent is far more likely to allow individuals to access the college they want and, as such, feel better motivation.
The combination of all this, pushing huge numbers of people towards college because they can actually afford it now, increasing the total amount of motivation for individuals and poverty, and allowing individuals to access whatever school they would like, assuming they get in, does a few things.
First, we think it lets them access higher paying jobs.
Higher paying jobs lead to a higher quality of life and breaks cycles of poverty.
Additionally, we think individuals will have better access to politics, will have better networking, a a better understanding of the issues and, as such, be able to engage in a more meaningful discourse which will ultimately create better policies for the whole of the united states.
My second argument is this is likely to expand diversity in a number of spheres.
We think that individuals in poverty have a fairly high correlation to individuals who have been historically oppressed due to the color of their skin or the religion that they come from.
Putting these people into higher education and then higher paying jobs later on is likely to increase the quality of education in the first place.
Having diverse viewpoints and diverse voices in the classroom mean that all people can learn more effectively.
Additionally, though, we think that we're going to get a more tolerant society as a result of these kinds of policies.
When you have frequent contact with people from a variety of different races, you are far more likely to see them as equals and as common people deserving of respect.
Additionally, you're likely to hear their stories and understand the individual ways in which you can help other marginalized groups, pulling the whole of society up.
For this reason, we should subsidize higher education."
"Tower blocks are advantageous.
So, what we mean by this in this debate is that high-rise housing, such as residential buildings of five or six or more stories, is ultimately advantageous over more traditional smaller housing buildings.
So, three main arguments for you today.
The first is about cheaper housing.
A major problem facing many cities today, such as new york or london, is that housing has grown so expensive that even middle-class people are no longer able to afford to live in the city.
We tell you that the only way to solve this is to build high-rise housing.
Why is this true?
You can't increase the amount of land in a city.
The only thing that you can do is house more people in the same area.
Since you can't build out, you must build up.
Ultimately, the only way to ensure that people can continue to live near the area where they work, can continue to remain in the communities where they grew up, is to facilitate the creation of cheaper housing, and the best way to do that is with these tower blocks.
So we see that there's a tremendous advantage here over traditional housing in terms of the cost of individual apartment units.
Our second argument is about sustainability.
We think that people living more densely, ultimately, is going to be more environmentally sustainable.
Why is this true?
We tell you that people, when they choose to live in a more urban sprawl or suburban-type environment, ultimately, damage much more of that environment.
Imagine that in new york city, the maximum amount of environmental damage has already been done.
There's already very little green space and things like that.
It would be preferable to put more people into that environment rather than to have them sprawl further and further into new york state, where you still have large forests and fields in places where the environment is relatively less damaged by human occupation.
We think that, if anything, you would want to facilitate people moving back into cities, who have left in the in the past, which kind of gets back to what I was talking about in terms of cheaper housing.
But on top of that, we also tell you that it's easier to provide services, like water and electricity, more cheaply to these tower blocks, because everyone is located all in one place.
We think that in the future, sustainability needs to be one of the hallmarks of urban development, that we can no longer continue to build low-rise housing just because people like it a little bit better, when it means that in the future the environment will be greatly harmed, and future people won't be able to enjoy high or low-rise housing, because places like new york will be under water.
Our final argument is about urban renewal and why we think it is improved by the use of these tower blocks.
First of all, we want to talk about why tower blocks have been constructed historically.
In addition to lower prices, we also see that they've been built in areas that had fallen on hard times in the past.
In eastern europe, tower blocks are common in cities that were destroyed in the second world war.
They were built as a quick way to revitalize cities where lots of people had lost their homes.
This is still the case in places like serbia today, and we think that obviously it would be better to rebuild cities more quickly than less quickly.
But even in places that haven't seen lots of conflict, we tell you that if you want to bring in lots of people to a city in order to revitalize communities that have fallen on hard times, in order to create more opportunities for businesses and investment, that the best way to do that is to create a large housing stock for these people to live in.
Ultimately, if there's nowhere for people to go, they won't come.
If you build it, we tell you that, ultimately, they will come.
So we see that since most cities around the world probably have districts that have fallen on hard times, that are not being used as effectively as they could, that ultimately tower blocks should be advantageous for those reasons.
So I'll conclude by saying that while it's true that tower blocks have some disadvantages in terms of aesthetics or privacy, that ultimately, the benefits in terms of cost, in terms of environmental sustainability, and in terms of the ability to renew areas that have fallen on hard times, outweigh these drawbacks.
Thank you."
"We should ban partial birth abortions.
So what this debate is about is abortions that are performed in the late second or in the third trimester of the pregnancy.
In which the fetus is partially extracted, and has its brain scooped out by a doctor and then the fetus is removed.
So these abortions are performed for many reasons.
Some might be performed at the mother's request, others might be performed for the safety of the mother or because the fetus has already died, but we are opposed to this in any instance where it isn't medically required.
So, with that in mind we have two main arguments.
The first of which is that killing a fetus that is able to feel pain, is ultimately wrong.
We're not contending that the fetus is the same as a baby that has already been born, but what we are saying is that if you look at the net harm to the fetus versus the mother, you're going to weigh down on the side of the fetus in every single instance.
Why is this true?
Let's consider the worse case where a mother has severe illness or mental health harms that are actually being suffered from her by the pregnancy.
We would be okay with this in those instances because there is a clear and present danger to the mother's life in the form of mental illness.
But at other times, when a person may not want to bring a child to term, but isn't experiencing this anguish or mental illness, we think that it's true that there is a certain amount of suffering and disutility going on, but the loss of all future utility to that fetus, compounded with the disutility of having itself be killed by a doctor, clearly you're always going to weigh those harms much more highly.
We see that for instance the anguish caused by this pregnancy, is going to be temporary, whereas the harm of being dead, ultimately weighs on forever.
But aside from that, we see that although the fetus isn't a person right now, it's clearly has the potential to develop into one.
Many children are born prematurely at an and survive at an age when this type of abortion would be performed.
So it's clear that the fetus would be able to survive and develop into a healthy human given the opportunity.
So at the end of the day we think that it is fundamentally unethical to kill a fetus that has the potential to become a citizen in the future, and that on top of that in your moral decision making, you want always consider more highly the person who served or being that serves to lose the most, rather than the being that serves to have the most rights in the status quo.
This is why for instance, even though animals obviously have lesser moral standing than humans, we still don't let people have cock fights, say.
Because although there might be utility for the people who practice that sport, the disutility to the roosters is much greater.
Now, we're not trying to compare these mothers who want an abortion to cock fighters, but we do think that at the end of the day it would be unethical for the state not to consider what is best for the fetus given this tremendous amount of disutility versus the utility to the mother which, though not marginal, is still lesser.
Our second argument is that we think that it is unjust or unethical for doctors to participate in these partial birth abortions.
Remember that when someone becomes a medical doctor, they swear the hippocratic oath, which basically states they will never do any intentional harm to a human being.
Now, it's questionable at what point a fetus become a person, but certainly they are a human being in the biological sense.
We think that doctors ought not be performing this late term abortion that involves killing a fetus therefore, because that fetus, one, is going to develop into a person, and two, meets our standards for what a human is, namely, the ability to continue on as a human being, I suppose.
But whatever standard you want to use, we think that doctors are violating one of the oaths that they took, a very serious one moreover, when they perform this type of abortion.
We think that the government should step in to prevent them from doing so.
Since the state takes responsibility for regulating doctors and for managing medical ethics, so there's a clear precedent for government to intervene to prevent doctors from committing misdeeds and ultimately this would fall into that category.
So for these two reasons, we should ban partial birth abortions.
Thank you."
"We should increase reforestation.
By this we just mean that we think that there should be a general effort and like money put into situations in which we try to replant the trees that are being cut down and kind of like like reforestation is self explanatory.
We just want to replace the trees that have been taken out in the forest, that have been taken out.
Three main arguments, first on protecting the environment.
Trees a play a really important role when it comes both to just like the food chain in the ecosystems they exist in, but also in terms of like the broader topsoil issues.
Like as we've heard, a massive thing that trees do is they stabilize the soil in the area because their roots create systems that keep that soil in place.
And then what happens is that when it rains you don't just get all of the soil being washed away because you have these systems of tree roots that keep it in place.
So one of the biggest problems with deforestation is that you're getting rid of those root systems and those trees, so when the rains come all of that soil gets washed into the local water sources, it pollutes those local water sources, it kills the animals in those water sources, and then sets off these other chain of events.
The problem with side opposition is that they're always going to be flying in the face of the fact that nature is one giant domino effect.
You can't just take out a portion and expect everything else to stay the same.
Trees are just one item in a long line of things that affect and interplay with each other.
So when you remove trees from the equation, you're setting off these dominoes like you're setting off the pollution of the water supply, you're setting off the death of these animals, you're setting off the death of the future animals who survive by eating those animals that you've just killed off, and this just keeps cycling and snowballing and we think that that needs to be prevented.
But also, we think replenishing the trees is independently a good thing too.
Like recognize that a lot of these trees provide homes and sustenance to the nature that surrounds it so when you destroy them, you're necessarily cutting out those other groups of animals as well.
This is the problem we're having with the destruction of the jungle right now, is that when you cut down the jungle because you want to use the trees for things you are also destroying all of the flora and fauna that grew around them and relied on those trees which is bad because a lot of the time we didn't even have those things documented.
So it's unclear to us what exactly we're losing.
Like it's completely possible that some of those animals contained chemicals that could have been really useful for us or did things that we could have really learned from.
Aside from like the very clear it's bad that we're losing biodiversity, it's also really bad that we're losing these things that could've been truly useful to humanity as well.
We also our second argument is about creating a clean atmosphere.
Trees filter the air, they make it cleaner and more pleasant.
They deal with the pollutants that we're constantly sending into the atmosphere and they also provide oxygen.
So when we cut down trees, we remove that which can produce oxygen while continuing to produce more and more carbon dioxide every day which then contributes to things like the global warming effects and all of these other things that trees can directly act against.
We we reforestation we start to adjust that balance which is sure maybe not enough but will be better than doing nothing which we think is important.
Our third argument is about aesthetics.
Trees are just really pretty, they allow children and adults alike to feel like they are comfortable with nature and enjoy it.
There's really never a downside of reforestation which is why I have a really hard time imagining what opposition is even going to say.
Like the existence of reforestation and efforts does things like increase jobs and other benefits that I list.
It's the burden on op to show a negative to reforestation that would outweigh any of this and we think that's super hard because we just don't see any of these negatives and we think that any marginal negatives like maybe it's an expensive process are just outweighed because that expense is not so large that it should be worth doing not doing something so good.
Proud to propose."
"We should increase student financial aid in the united states.
Our model for this is basically that we're referring to university education.
We think that public high schools that pretty much subsidize the majority of people's education costs exist in the status quo.
But the problem right now is that even public colleges can still be incredibly expensive for individuals who are doing things like taking advantage of in state tuition, and we think that's incredibly problematic.
Two arguments, first on education as a fundamental right.
Recognize that when in order to access all of the things that are explicitly stated within the constitution, such as our right to free speech, our right to petition and all of these things, you oftentimes need things like an education.
Even to do things like live and pursue the right to like happiness or whatever, these things require in modern time an education to be able to access them.
So it's not just about this is something that would be nice to have.
It's not just a like fun benefit that we would survive without.
It's literally that the poverty statistics for individuals that don't get a college education are awful by comparison to those that do.
That you have a much higher chance of not having the food that you need, being homeless, not dying of a preventable disease, all of these things are infinitely higher statistically for those who don't get a college education.
And a lot of the time cost is the main barrier that prevents that.
Because a lot of people are really terrified of doing things like taking out a large amount of loans and a lot of people don't even have the credit that allows them to do that without having a middle class family.
So the idea that this is just some lackadaisic treat that people give themselves, which I'm sure op will come up here and say, is nonsense.
Recognize that education is often a tool of the oppressor.
If you keep your victims stupid they can't out act out act out against you.
And because of that, it's not just about the facilitative right that it provides, it's also about why is this necessary to preserve democracy.
Because the people are never capable of protecting themselves if they're too busy working dead end jobs that they only work because they don't have an education to access something better.
Education mediates class differences.
Because the economic class that I'm born into is completely arbitrary and the main way to gain upward mobility is through an education that provides me with the job and networking opportunities that actually let me take myself out of the class I'm in.
And just the statistics on whether or not someone to escape their class without an education shows the majority of people stay in whatever class they're born in unless they're capable of going to college.
This is really important especially in countries like the united states where class disparity is growing.
In the status quo the arbitrary class I'm born into often dictates where I stay the rest of my life.
And we think that that's really problematic and something the government needs to account for because the amount of individuals who are going without basic human rights because they aren't accessing an education is massive.
But our second argument is about promoting positive social impacts.
First, more people go to school.
Like in so far as a lot of people are just currently discouraged by the cost, taking away that cost barrier and promoting it as the government is likely to get people going there getting there more.
This is really good because it means that more people are getting jobs and less for doing things like relying on government assistance, but also their children are growing up with more opportunity and it is more likely that those people aren't going to need to do things like rely on financial aid when they go to university.
So it breaks those kinds of bad cycles and it prevents the government from having to pay more in the long term by allowing individuals out.
It also decreases unemployment because in the status quo we have the trend of lower lower end labor decreasing because of things like automatization.
But the need for higher level educated labor is rising as we explore new like fields of AI, of medicine, of technology.
All of these things need people who have a degree.
So we think that you're going to have less unemployment and just a better economy in general when you're fulfilling the needs of that economy.
You get a more educated populace who makes better political decisions.
All of this is good.
Proud to propose."
"The definition of advantageous is a bit hazy.
It's not clear if it applies to corporations or to consumers.
Luckily the distinction is meaningless because it's advantageous to both.
I find that open source software is something that is uniquely beneficial to the entire industry, regardless of which side of the equation you're on.
This brings me into my two independent points: first, the the open source software is a beneficial trend for corporations, and secondly that it helps consumers.
On the note of corporations, it's important to note for two reasons: first, that it reduces labor cost.
Recognize that you're letting your consumer do a significant amount of the work for you.
For example, when chrome like has to engage in these like large research and development programs, it doesn't have to put as much money into it because consumers are doing a decent amount of work for them.
That means that that you have a less up front cost for the corporation itself, and you're able to either take that as profit or decrease the cost that you pass on the consumer.
Either way it's a win win for the corporation.
But secondly, you have the beneficial optics of transparency.
You're seen as someone that is transparent and open with their customers in a way that a lot of other firms in your industry aren't.
Organizations like microsoft, for example, which are notorious for keeping corporate secrets, are seen as the bad guys in this industry.
That's important for two reasons: one, it puts more people on your door at the beginning, it makes it more likely that people are going to be doing business with you if they see you with someone that is trustworthy, but secondarily it generates brand loyalty.
That means that you get long term stability for your corporation because that means that people are going to be coming back time and time again when they see was the good guy, when they don't have qualms about doing business with you.
My second independent point is that open open source software is beneficial to consumers.
Again, two reasons why this is true: first it decreases the cost that consumers have to bear for purchasing a product.
Recognize that safeguarding corporate secrets, like software patents for example, decreases access to that on an industry wide level.
That creates effective monopolies within the industry and that's a problem because see how this happens in the pharmaceutical industry, where one corporation gets their secrets on how to make x thing, and as a result prices can be whatever they want because they're the only people that have it.
Open source software revolutionizes this, however.
It means that you can especially access increase access to people who normally would not be able to afford the prices that are generated when one corporation or one actor has unique control over the item.
This is especially helpful for the third world, where generally these products aren't even marketed because of the perception that there isn't a market that can afford these items there, especially businesses, you know, word processing softwares and things like that are going to be particularly beneficial and increasing that access is going to translate into ground level impacts for people who normally would not have that access.
Secondly though, we would say that it creates a disconnect between the corporation it decreases the disconnect that exists in the status quo between the corporation and the consumer.
It means more direct input.
You are literally engaging with the software as a consumer any more direct way, and that means that you get rid of the system in the status quo, where corporations are often fumbling in the dark trying to figure out what consumers want and then market that item to them.
This reverses the equation.
It means that consumers have a direct channel by which to tell corporations: "" this is the thing we want. ""
By signaling with the tweaks that you put on the product that is released in the first place, you give the corporation a perception of what exactly it is you are looking for and create a more efficient marketplace that is capable of easily targeting what it is that consumers are looking for.
I'm not quite sure what advantageous is supposed to mean, but luckily this is a a trend within the software industry that is beneficial to all parties.
There isn't a way to twist this that sees open source software as something that is harmful, and as result I am proud to stand in proposition."
"We should adopt blasphemy laws.
Blasphemy laws are laws that forbid people from for instance, insulting a religious figure or intentionally violating or causing someone else to violate some religious code.
So if you remember the charlie hebdo comics that caused all that trouble in france a few years ago because of how they depicted the prophet mohammed or similar comics that have existed over the past few years, we think that things like that should probably be made illegal.
We're not going to ban people from saying you know god damn and other things like that that have kind of seeped into general western culture, but we think that when someone is intentionally being blasphemous to provoke outrage or to offend someone that's when we want to step in and ban it.
I think that that intent to cause outrage or to offend a particular religious group is what we're trying to stop on our side of this debate.
So with that in mind, our first argument is that this will encourage respective minority religions.
Right I don't think it's a coincidence that the most famous instances of blasphemy causing problem in a community in recent years have been for islam and european countries.
So we've seen that many islamic communities have been highly offended by very blasphemous portrayals of muhammad or blasphemous statements made about islam.
I don't think it's a coincidence that this group is being targeted more than dominant religious groups with the intent to cause offense and the other side might say "" oh well plenty of people do this about the catholic church too "" but I'd point out that tends to be in protestant majority countries as well so the effect is actually similar.
But I think that the reason why we see minority religious groups being targeted is that although this isn't a racial prejudice necessarily, I mean many muslims are white living in white countries there is still a bias against these communities and people want to make them feel unwelcome because they don't want muslims to assimilate into their society.
So I think that it's clear that the intent here is to belittle and threaten a community not just to go after one particular belief system.
In other words it's not like the people making the charlie hebdo comic have some deep theological objection to some tenet of islam, rather they just want to make muslims feel unsafe or uncomfortable and in the same way that we would ban in most western countries speech that intended to make a racial group uncomfortable, for instance, we might prevent someone from publishing a magazine cover that betrayed black people in a very racist way, we need to do the same thing to protect minority religious groups.
After all, religion is for most people an immutable trait the same way that race is and it needs to be protected in the same way therefore.
But our second argument is that this would also limit inter-community violence.
So we've seen, for instance as a result of those charlie hebdo comics, a lot of violence between different communities that I think could be prevented with these speech laws.
Now it's true that no speech should prompt someone to violence but ultimately in the same way that we see the doctrine of fighting words, the idea that sometimes someone is threatened or put in a position that forces them to be violent, I think it's clear that there is speech that is created with the idea that it will cause another group to become violent and that that's something that we probably need to ban in the same way that we ban riotous speech, for instance.
So it seems clear to me that if one of the intentions of portraying the prophet mohammed doing sex acts or similarly vulgar things involving islam is to provoke the islamic community into going out in the streets and rioting in paris, then it's clear that that type of speech should be banned because it's intended to cause crimes and to cause people to be violent.
So this is actually quite consistent with existing laws.
So I'd like to close with the idea that what I'm proposing here while a blasphemy law is quite different from the laws we saw in the old conservative european governments and more like the hate speech laws we see in the EU today.
For all these reasons, we should implement blasphemy laws.
Thank you."
"We should ban pipeline transportation because pipeline transportation leads to a lot of problems.
It leads to a lot of environmental problems, it increases our reliance on fossil fuels and it often has a lot of bad social consequences as well in addition the environmental consequences.
So let's start by just talking about what are some of the like broader impacts of of pipeline transportation.
And I think what oil pipelines are designed to do is they're designed to make natural gas and oil as cheap as transporting it as cheap as possible.
So in theory that may sound good.
Nobody likes to pay four dollars a gallon for their gasoline in a country like america.
But these kinds of things come with costs.
Because the lower oil the lower the price of oil is the lower the prices of gas is and things like that, the more you're going to not really care about being energy efficient.
The more you're just going to waste a lot of like energy on like on like cooling or heating your house, on things like that, on your car, and more like perniciously, the less emphasis there's going to be on transitioning to greener technologies as an alternative.
Because it simply isn't going to matter as much because when oil is so cheap there's not really that much of an impetus to to change to better alternatives like green technologies.
So oil pipelines that make oil cheaper are a direct problem for the advancement of green technology and all of the problems that will come with climate change can partly be to blame for that.
So by banning pipeline transportation you make oil more expensive and that's really good for the entire world.
The next thing is oil pipelines themselves are oftentimes riddled with problems directly in like the more direct environmental consequences that they have.
There's there's oftentimes tons of leaks in oil pipelines and these things can go on for like basically like like thousands and thousands of miles.
They can go from like northern canada to like louisiana.
Like they basically cover entire swaths of like continents.
So these things are huge.
They're not getting inspected constantly, they're not like being put in with the best technology, it's usually these companies that wanna just like create a cheap tube.
So they're not really oftentimes all that well.
And moreover, people don't really care if there's leaks.
The like corporations don't care if like there's like some random like oil dripping into like the ecosystem in like nebraska or montana or wherever.
So oftentimes there is like a ton of leaks.
There is in fact like it's usually just kind of like a regular an expected thing that when you have these oil pipeline they're going to leak there's going to be these occasional problems and that can result in a lot of environmental consequences.
It can result in destruction of like natural habitats, it can make it harder for like things like animal migrations, it could like poison drinking waters and things like that, and that's like just from the oil.
The process of constructing these pipelines themselves can oftentimes cause a lot of additional problems as well.
The other thing is that there is a tendency to do this in a really racist way and the reason for that is because nobody wants an oil pipeline in your backyard.
It's one of those classic not in my back yard things.
If you're like some bougie person who's living in a big house, you want cheap oil for your you want like cheap gas for your car but you don't want the oil pipeline to be in your backyard.
So where these pipelines go?
They tend to go like through more disadvantaged areas where they can just kind of like place the pipelines there without having these people complain as much.
So that's why you see like the protests at standing rock for example, or other indigenous communities, where these kinds of things have been problems.
Because generally they try to put pipelines in places where there's where the where they don't really care about the costs that it's going to have.
If it's poisoning somebody's drinking water, if it's poisoning somebody's environment then they don't really then they're going to put it towards like oftentimes more disadvantaged communities places.
So for all those reasons we should ban oil pipelines."
"Three reasons we should ban alternative medicine.
One, on the opportunity cost involved.
Two, on abusive deception of people in the worst way, and three, on the harm to decision making of individuals.
Briefly, on definitions and mechanism.
Alternative medicine, as far as we're concerned, is anything that has not passed proper medical testing to be proven to be more effective than a placebo to a reasonable degree.
What are we not going to talk about in this debate?
Those medications that are actively harmful, medications that are poisoning individuals and actively harming them.
We think obviously that should be banned that that's not going to likely be the core of this debate.
We think a likely core of this debate is about those medications that are not helpful or no more helpful than a placebo, but not harmful direct in any direct sort of way, and to an extent, potentially make the patient feel better, make him feel like he's doing something, like he has some sort of chance.
Let's talk about why these nonetheless harm those patients immensely.
First, on opportunity cost.
We think that alternative medicine comes at an enormous opportunity cost.
Why?
Because a, it costs a patient a lot of money.
Note that often these patients are people who don't have very much money because they're often debilitated and unable to work in order to maintain more money.
So unless they came into this disease having an enormous sum of money, they're likely depleted at the time at which they decide to turn to alternative medicine.
Two, it costs them time.
In order to get your alternative care you need to go out, see that the the shamans or whatever it is go out again and buy the prescriptions wherever it is that you get it.
All of these things are things that are exhausting if you're not sick, if you are sick more over than that, they're even more tiring for the individual.
So we think it is it makes it highly likely that alternative medicine is not supplementary, but rather comes at the expense, oftentime, of regular medications.
Two reasons that's an unbearable opportunity cost.
One, because we think oftentimes these people could have been healed.
It is true that people often turn to alternative medicine when traditional medicine has nothing left to offer, but that is not always the case and moreover, traditional medicine, given that it is continuously evolving, often has a more things to offer if you can stick with it and push through it.
So we think some of these people can be healed.
But even if not, we think it comes at the cost of quality of life that traditional medicine can give you.
So even if they can't heal whatever it is that you're sick with, they can often give you medications that enable to live your life out more comfortably.
This is conversely to alternative medicine, which while it will claim to heal you, and maybe even make you feel a little bit better through placebo, note you get that same feeling of better through the medication that are actually making you feel better, and you get the physical helping that they give for your quality of life.
Secondly, we think this is an abusive form of deception.
Why is it abusive?
You're literally taking people's money at the lowest possible point of their life when they've given up all hope.
We think the rationality of an individual in this situation is immensely questionable, and therefore we think we have the right, and in fact duty to intervene in order to help these individuals and save them from people prying at them and trying to get every last bit of money out of them when they're least able to protect themselves.
Lastly, on the harms in decision making.
So we think prop case is op case is likely to come in here and say "" look, worst case scenario, they lived out the rest of their days, the same amount of days they would have otherwise lived out, with some sort of feeling of hope, some sort of feeling of option for survival "".
We already showed why that's unlikely to be the truth, but even in the cases where that is true, we think that in itself if deceptive and not good.
Why?
Because people don't leave behind emptiness.
People leave behind a history, they leave behind a family, they leave behind a story.
That story needs to be closed off.
When someone has the information that they're going to die, they are then able to do things like writing a will, like communicating with long lost family members, like finalizing their last wishes on earth, that they're likely to avoid doing if they're hanging on to false hope of continuous survival.
So even then, these individuals are being harmed.
For all these reasons, please propose the motion."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban child actors.
What we mean by this is that currently you have a lot of shows and movies that have child characters, and they actually hire people who are of that age, as young as toddlers.
A lot of the time those that go on to have long-term careers in movies are about five to ten years old when they first start.
They basically work full-time jobs on these shifts, and we would say that this would no longer be allowed.
Any movie industry or corporation that is found using child actors would be heavily fined.
If it's a repeated offense they'd be shut down, and you would you wouldn't be allowed to like prep your children in this way.
Two main areas of clash: first, on the child labor legal inconsistency that occurs when we allow for child actors.
Because in the united states we ban child labor, given that we recognize that kids should be spending time being kids: so, developing social relations with people their own age, going to school, having fun outside, like learning what their preferences are given that very soon, their childhood's going to end and they're going to be expected to do adult things and have adult responsibilities.
And it's actually we think on opposition and the burden on opposition to show us why there should be a different standard specifically for acting at all.
We think in the end, there's virtually no difference between hiring a child to work in a mine, hiring a child to work in a store, and hiring a child to act in a movie, except for the fact that the first two are illegal, and for some reason, the last one is legal.
We also think that it's actually worse in the movie industry, because kids are often forced to be on the scene and on set almost twenty-four seven when they're working for a certain show or a certain movie.
This isn't like most jobs, when you go to school and then after school, you go to work.
Rather, your life becomes your work.
They oftentimes have to put school on hold or get homeschooled because of their career.
They are interacting primarily with adults and other kids who are on set, oftentimes there are very few of them.
They don't get very much free time.
They have to go through rigorous acting lessons and acting prep, and they're also oftentimes yelled at and like emotionally manipulated to do their roles.
And we think that this is actually much more intensive and demanding than any other job and thus should be held to the same legal standard.
There are the same harmful impacts that would come with any kind of child labor.
Our second area of clash is about why it's bad for kids.
First, we want to talk about the lack of consent that exists.
Kids are too young to say "" yes "" to holding down a full-time job.
First, this is because they don't have a context with which to understand what they're saying yes to.
Right?
Like if I if I've lived like twenty, thirty, forty years, I've watched a lot of I've probably done a lot of research about a specific industry that I want I'm interested in, I've probably watched a lot of movies and documentaries.
Like, I have a much better understanding of what that time can looks like because I've actually lived that amount of time that I'm committing to.
Like, in general, you just have a much better way of contextualizing your experience in the course of the world and in your life.
But children have only been around for a really small amount of time, and like and what this means is that they can't actually contextualize what the next six months of their life might look like or what they're committing to in terms of publicity, because they've never seen someone else experience it in the first place.
We also think that they can't consent because it's a decision they often make because of their parents, right?
Like because they're too young to say yes, a lot of the time their parents are the ones who introduce the opportunity to them, or say this is an option, and so what this means is that they often feel like their parents have an expectation of them to go and do this thing that their parents really like.
Given that they usually really look up to and want to please their parents, it means that they're very likely to say yes to them, even if they don't actually want to do it.
So we think they can't consent meaningfully either.
Other than that, we've already told you why it's bad.
It stunts their education, it oftentimes traps them into a career when they know nothing else.
It's psychologically messy given that they're small children dealing with things like fame, working all the time, and they lose out on normal childhood experiences.
It's literally child abuse.
Ban child acting."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish term limits.
Two main areas of clash, first on why this creates a more democratic system.
Recognize that it allows peoples' preferences to control outcomes while term limits remove individuals' options and limit democracy.
It's paternalistic of the government to limit terms because they assume that people can't kick out politicians who are bad for them or who have gone sour over time.
Rather we think that the government is supposed to be a reflection of the preferences of the constituents which only happens when people can actualize their preferences without limits on who their options are.
Recognize also that a lot of the reasons that term limits exist are to prevent like endemic corruption or like long term like poor policy etcetera but insofar as these individuals need to get reelected over and over, there's a massive incentive not to mess up what you're doing or not to go against what your constituents elected you for because they simply will not re-elect you.
This also eliminates the last hurrah effect that we often see where because like a certain congressman or certain senator knows that they have no more terms after that, they are way more likely to go out and do some radical policy that doesn't reflect what they were elected to vote on or what their constituents desire because they know that there's not going to be any kind of re-election and we think this is actually inherently democratic because antidemocratic because regardless of what party you're on regardless of like one particular politician's last hurrah being good or bad for you personally because like we think that it oftentimes what's been democrats doing a lot of good versus like doing a lot of good in like more moderate districts but we also think it could spin to like republicans doing really really awful things and more like democratic in more moderate districts of their own.
So we don't think that that's what part of the conversation rather we think that like regardless of whether or not you personally agree or disagree with the policy, it's bad when that is the policy of the majority of a region and then their representative goes on not to do it because they don't have any consequences if they don't.
And we think that's exactly the kind of world that term limits creates because it creates a situation in which there is no accountability, there's nothing that we can do about them going off on their own and so we think that it's bad.
Our second area of clash is about how it's good for public public policy.
Recognize that part of the reason for bureaucracy is that with congress people and elected officials are constantly rotated so it's really hard to pass consistent policy.
This is especially true since every new person has an incentive to try something new and put some new policy out there because they want to distinguish themselves from their predecessors so there are actually no incentives to continue working on old legislature or if like someone left office right as like something was about to pass there's no incentive to continue pushing it if they were the main motivating force behind it.
So we think that that's really bad.
Without term limits we incentivize coalition building that allows bipartisan legislature into the long term because there's less of an incentive to show animosity when you plan on being there for awhile and you need to show long term growth to your constituents.
We think that the incentive structure for what you accomplish fundamentally changes.
In the status quo individuals are fine with showing short term growth because they know they're only going to be there for a short term so whether that short term growth is pissing off every single republican because you're a democrat and so your constituents are excited that you're taking hardline stances or whether it's passing really small stick policy none of that is actually impacted in the long term.
Rather on our side of the house because you're going to be there for a really long time because you're worried about re-election for multiple multiple years you have to show that you can work with other people and show that you can provide long term good policy.
The current system only allows the former and we think that's incredibly problematic.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"I'm proud to stand proposition of today's motion that year round schooling should be implemented.
So for the model, I think this is fairly straightforward that you're going to consent into summer school, so it's not going to be this thing that's mandatory for all children, so like the model for year round schooling that exists right now, is essentially just that there are summer schools that exist for multiple purposes, whether that be as a thing for kids who are behind on their classes to catch up with their classmates or if it's a thing where kids that want to get ahead in sort of graduate early can do that, or any multitude of reasons why an individual might want to engage in year round schooling, but the point being that it is a thing you consent into.
Three independent points under this: first is that choice is good and that there are individuals it works for, and the individuals that it doesn't work for don't have to engage in the system.
Secondly, that it increases educational opportunity and educational benefits and the quality of education, and third that it is a more efficient system.
So first under notice of like why choice is good.
Recognize that this is a thing that doesn't like harm you if you do not engage in it, right?
There are obviously going to be kids that this doesn't work for, that they are kids that need sort of that like unstructured time during the summer where they're not in school, right?
Those people don't have to engage in year round schooling, right?
Like the people who are going to engage in year round schooling are most likely going to be people that, you know, like failed a class and want to graduate on time, because there are like structural reasons why they need to do that regarding like their employment or like their college aspirations or things like that, right?
There are kids who are just like extremely smart and want to get ahead, or like their parents want to get them ahead or whatever.
Insofar as there are legitimate reasons why individuals would want to use this type of schooling, it is always better to give them the option to do that and then allow people that it wouldn't work for to consent out of the system.
Second independent point is it's better education.
So this is true because it breaks like the severing that occurs in the learning process with a large summer break, right?
This is especially true for multi year classes like in new york state for example, where world history is taught over the course of two years.
So when you sever your your learning like that, when you have like a large break in the middle of your educational career, essentially, and there's this huge break between when you're learning about these things, it mentally distances you from the subject you were learning.
You are coming back in the fall very rusty, like not as accustomed a school, it's like this almost foreign thing to you a lot of the time, where it takes like a while to get back into the swing of things.
That creates like a lot of inefficiencies in the system, but it also decreases your retention of the things that you learn in the long term because it's not a constant source of information coming to you.
There are large breaks in the middle of it.
So that's a problem for the quality of your education, and we think we should allow people to consent into a system that gives them a better education.
The third independent point is efficiency.
So, this breaks down in two ways: the first is that, in three ways rather.
The first is that by breaking that severing in the learning process you increase the educational efficiency because you don't have to backtrack and like reteach things and things like that when people come back into the system.
Secondly, it gives kids more structure in the summer, right?
So like a lot of the time you would have, you have like literally entire industries dedicated to like keeping kids entertained in the summer time like things like summer camp and things like that.
We think these are naturally inefficient.
They use large amounts of space that could be used for other things, they are necessarily like expensive and we think that's a like a drain on family finances, when you could have this publicly funded school system that instead gives your kids the structure that they need during the summer and gives them things to do and keeps them entertained.
Lastly under this though, is that it's like literally a waste of space to not be utilizing the school during the summer.
That is sort of like this hollow house that serves no purpose and occupies large amounts of land.
Especially in cities where space is like a scarce thing, it is important to ensure that spaces are constantly being used in order to ensure that you are not wasting space that could be used on something else.
Because it's a zero sum, people have to be in a location at any given time, and when they are not in school they are somewhere else using some other space that could be used for a different thing.
So it's always good when we keep the space actively engaged.
Proud to propose."
"We should further exploit wind power.
What we mean by furthering the exploiting wind power is firstly, we think we should have government subsidize the production and signs behind developing the technologies for wind power.
Secondly, we would provide incentives for the average corporation or the average person to invest in wind power, to get power through wind power corporations and thirdly, we would like to have a world in which the norm is that in which wind power is more prominent.
So we don't we're not gonna be talking specifically about policy but generally about the benefits of wind power in a comparative sense with fossil fuels and other types of clean energy.
So firstly, we think in any sort of debate about clean energy the most important thing at stake is global warming.
Recognize that we are at a point in which we've done so much damage to our environment through the industrialization of the globe, that we are a tipping point where global temperatures will rise by two to four degrees celsius annually over the course of over the course of several hundred of the course about a hundred years in a way that will cause global global ice caps to melt, will cause higher sea temperatures which will lead to increased natural disasters and increased veracity of those natural disasters such as more hurricanes, stronger hurricanes, things like that.
It leads to droughts which make people, especially those that are the most vulnerable with least food security, incredibly likely to starve because they simply cannot continue to have the same planting patterns that they have had for hundreds of years but rather they have to develop entirely new planting patterns or the rain simply will not come in the way it needs to for these people to be fed and we're also at a point at which it's almost going to be irreversible soon.
Scientists say that if we don't have drastic change in the next five years in the very near future we will be at a point in which all the changes because of the greenhouse effect and all the changes that have been caused by trapping more carbon dioxide and more heat our atmosphere, if we don't do something now we are going to be at a point which the chain reactions of our actions in the last hundred years are not going to be reversed and at the and at that that point we're creating harm not just for ourselves but for our children, our grandchildren, the people that will have no choice about coming into this world but through our own desires will come into existence, through our own choices, and we are dooming them into a world in which they will have to lead harder lives in which the globe will not be livable at the same way that it is now, in which we will ruin the natural environment that our ancestors for hundreds of years passed down on to us and allowed us to live and thrive.
We think we have an obligation to those people to change the way that we are behaving now.
So with all that in mind, why wind power?
Well firstly, wind power is clean and it is renewable.
You can't run out of the wind from having things like wind farms in the middle of the sea in which wind production is pretty much constant and also there's no outlying negative harms.
Your not having any sort of a mission or pollution that comes from this which means wind power is almost entirely a clean energy.
We also think that it's at a point in which the costs are still higher than fossil fuels and so things like further exploiting it are likely to drive down those cost.
Things like subsidizing the use and production of technologies are likely to drive down the costs of wind power in the future.
We also think that compared to other clean energy resources wind power is more versatile than things like solar because it's not there's no time of day when wind power simply isn't going to work and it's more versatile than things like nuclear because it simply safer and we have a better understanding of how it can be used and how it can be exploited.
So because global warming is so crucial and wind power as a common sense solution is a clean energy that will be useful, we think we should further exploit wind power."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should increase eco tourism.
What we mean by this is that we would probably provide governmental subsidies or we would provide some kind of encouragement on the part of the government for any individual country to increase eco tourism within its country.
But we also think that this debate is just like would it be a preferable world if eco tourism was increased.
Two main areas of clash: first on why it is like exceptionally good for developing countries.
Recognize that a lot of eco tourist locations are located in more developing countries.
Whether we're talking about the rain forests of brazil or the singaporean reefs or the multiple different beaches and like forests in india, we recognize that a lot of these areas are unique to developing countries, and at the end of the day sure, like the grand canyon is nice, but the US has comparatively very little to offer.
This means that those countries are going to be getting the majority of eco tourism and will be able to make a lot of money off of this.
This is really good because this money can now be used to reinvest in their country in ways that don't necessarily have to do with the ecology.
Like maybe now they are able to invest in things like social welfare or infrastructure that allows for sustainable like manufacturing development into long term.
And we think that all of that is like very good insofar as currently the only way in which they can make money to fund those kinds of things is by first creating those kinds of things.
Like it's really hard for countries like brazil to fund manufacturing without first having some kind of economic impetus coming from manufacturing.
This is a double bind that a lot of developing countries find themselves in, and we think that eco tourism provides a unique path, by which they can extricate themselves from the situation and have upfront capital that doesn't come from loans from other countries that are oftentimes quite predatory.
We also think that this does a really good job in terms of creating jobs for people.
We think that a massive problem in these areas is that they have very large unemployment statistics and the only way in which they can fix it is by developing the kind of industries they don't have the infrastructure for.
But eco tourism is relatively easy.
A lot of the times the hotels in these areas already exist or even creating like the impetus to make these hotels is the kind of infrastructure building that creates jobs in the first place.
So we actually think that you're providing a world in which you're giving people mobility through creating the jobs they can use to self sustained them into the future.
We also think that there are political impacts when people are feeling self empowered.
It's really difficult to be active in public policy or make like have any kind of political movement if you don't have a job first that will allow you to like be able to provide for your basic needs first.
Like people have priorities.
And so we think that when you have like a population that have an easier time finding a job, you're necessarily creating more empowered people that are going to be more active elsewhere.
But second I want to talk about saving the environment.
Because I think that this is really where the round comes down to.
If countries are going to make money off of it they won't tear it down.
We think a lot of the time right now these areas, that are really beautiful and shouldn't be torn down, get torn down because they're seen as economic opportunities.
Like you could put oil rigs over that reef.
Or you could over fish it and make money off of the fish.
You can create housing developments, etcetera.
Like there's a lot of gold in the brazilian rain forest that recently has made them consider tearing it down.
But we think that when they find out that they can make a profit over it, it changes the weighing calculus.
Because they can now afford to make the decision to keep it in place.
Like we don't think that countries like to tear down their beautiful fauna and like they're beautifully ecology.
Right?
Like we think that they have a lot of cultural value there and also understand that the ecosystem is worth something, but they often feel like they have to do so in order to fulfill their obligations to their own people and in order to continue like providing for their own people.
And so we think that it's like very important to change that calculus.
But we also think that letting people make connections is one of the most effective ways in which you influence individuals to save the ecosystems.
Right?
Like people shit on the environment because they don't care about it.
But when you make them care about it by causing them to form personal connections when they see it and experience it then you create the political will that can actually change things in the way that we treat the environment into the future.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"Sustainable forest management brings more good than harm.
So in this debate we're talking about not just you know general good governance of forest, but a particular set of guidelines that has been set up by international agreements, by groups like the united nations conference on environment and development, in order to set up general principles for forestry.
So with that in mind we have three arguments.
First, protecting the environment.
One of the main goals of sustainable forest management is to protect the environment.
We see that in many parts of the world, like brazil, very important ecosystems that can never be replaced are being destroyed at an alarming rate because of four manage poor management of forests and forest resources.
The net result is that species are going extinct and ultimately we will never be able to reclaim the type of biological diversity that once existed.
Once you make a species go extinct you can never recover it and in many instances once you cut down a rain forest you can never return it to that region.
We've seen that in places like brazil the soil is permanently destroyed after you deforest a region and the trees and plants that once grew there will never be returned.
What this means is that deforestation is a problem that will remain a problem forever.
You can never undo the damage.
We think that you should, in principle, never do something damaging that cannot be undone because you don't know about the future risks.
In practice that might not be practical but we think that at the very least it can be mitigated in the short term by implementing sustainable forest management.
Our second argument is about protecting communities.
So we tell you that millions of people are dependent on forest resources around the world as their primary way of life, and we think that you need to balance the interests of these different groups.
Again to return to brazil, there are native people whose ancestors have lived in these forests for thousands of years who are dependent on it for their traditional way of life from medicine, and food, and other resources, but there are also working class brazilians who are dependent on jobs in the forest industry, things like logging and harvesting certain rare plants et cetera.
We think that you need to balance the interest of both of these communities and that sustainable forest management is a tool to do so that we can preserve tracts of forest for the people who rely on them for their way of life and also allow some limited harvesting of forest resources to help the economy of these regions.
If in fact the other team gets up here and tells you that there are shortcomings and this will hurt halt economic development in countries like brazil, we tell you that in this much as there is already land that has been deforested, that land can be planted with other types of trees besides rain forest trees in order to promote a logging industry that is more sustainable, or more money in research can be put into reforestation that would allow the establishment of plantations and things like that rather than harvesting wild trees and that this would ultimately be the best for all the communities involved.
Our third point is about the duty to posterity.
The environment doesn't just belong to people who are alive right now.
The environment belongs to everybody.
We tell you that people who are going to be born in nine months have an equal claim to the rain forest and to other forest resources as you or I, but it doesn't stop there.
We think it's arbitrary to say that people who are alive right now have more right to the rain forest than people who will be alive in two hundred years or even two thousand years.
We think that the best thing you can do in order to ensure fair use of resources is to use them in a sustainable, moderate way so that future people will be able to access them the way that we've been able to access them.
Many times there are resources that we wish still existed today.
Things like the great barrier reef that have been heavily damaged by the actions of past generations and that can never be restored and we are filled with regret.
We shouldn't pass that on to future generations in the same way.
We need to be responsible in how we manage our forest resources and sustainable forest management is the best way to do that.
So for these three reasons sustainable forest management brings more good than harm."
"We should abolish primary elections.
Primary elections represent one of the worst features of our democracy.
They are anti-democratic, are not representative of the general election and, ultimately, play to the extremists within a population.
But because we think the united states' election system is so fundamentally flawed, we would support the following model: that the united states should adopt a parliamentary system.
Parliamentary systems typically do not have primary elections, as you don't really vote in politicians as much as you vote for the party, who then nominates a particular individual.
Three reasons why this is a good idea: first, on gridlock.
The current system we have of two parties, where only a single individual can win in any given election, is incredibly problematic.
A few reasons why: first, we think that two parties means that there can be winners and losers that are very easily defined.
Now this is very problematic.
If the democrats are trying to pass a bill, it is always good for the republicans to try to block that bill.
This is because a loss for the democrats in terms of faith from the public is always good for the republicans, even if they lose faith as well, as long as they lose less faith.
We think that a system which incentivizes sabotage and incentivizes pushing the government to a halt when the other party's in power is very problematic.
The parliamentary system does not do this.
If I want to sabotage another party, I can.
This will hurt both my party and their party, but a third, fourth, or fifth party will then fill in that void, rather than me gaining everything that the other party loses.
Essentially, our system is a zero-sum game which inherently leads to gridlock, while the parliamentary system is not.
Additionally, we think that the current system is all about getting a super majority, winning as many elections as possible.
The parliamentary system is largely about compromise.
It's parties working together to get similar goals passed.
We think that larger parties can stay more true to their goals and can stay more true to their platform as they have greater leverage in these kinds of negotiations.
And as such, we think you still maintain the democratic nature but also force parties to work together.
This leads me to my second argument about how parliamentary systems are inherently more democratic.
In the status quo, we the primary elections occur from individuals who are the most extremist in the party.
We see this on both the left and the right.
Democrats cater almost exclusively to their most extreme base when they try to win the primary elections, cause those are the people who turn out and because they don't need to win any republican votes.
Conversely, republicans appeal to the most right-wing, extremist, warhawk individuals possible and as such, both parties look odd or awkward going into the election.
The result of a primary election is either that a: the candidate lied in the primary election, is not nearly extreme as they say, or b: that the candidate simply loses in the election because they are extreme as they say, and that just does not win the general.
A parliamentary system will always be better as it allows people to easily identify the issues and the issues that the party stands for and as such, vote in favor of them, rather than having a candidate who flip-flops or is otherwise problematic.
It's also more democratic by having a multiparty system with more options.
We think the choice of democrat or republican can largely be a vacuous choice, and it's very important for other parties to come to power to create more choices for the people.
My third argument is that the voting system is inherently problematic insofar as you do not vote for the principles as much as the person in the current system.
With a parliamentary system, you elect the party, who can then appoint people to certain seats.
This is considerably better as it makes it so it's all about the issues.
The party does not really have a face, the party doesn't really have a voice or a height and as such, you only vote on the issues.
In american elections, we largely see the taller candidate winning, the more attractive candidate winning.
This is problematic and leads to worse policymaking overall.
For this reason, we should abolish primary elections."
"We should abandon feminism.
By this, we don't mean to say that we should abandon the fight against the patriarchy or the women's liberation movement but rather the twentieth century trappings of feminism as such.
So our first argument is that we think that feminism divides people who have more in common than they realize right now.
In the status quo, we think that a lot of liberation movements, like feminism, like black liberation, like marxism, their followers don't see everything that they have in common because they've been put into little silos, where people think, "" oh, I'm a maoist revolutionary.
I shouldn't care about feminism, "" or "" I'm a feminist.
I shouldn't care about ending oppressive colonial regimes in the third world, "" because they don't see that all oppressed peoples are up against a common enemy, namely white men who control capital throughout the world.
And because of this division, it's basically a divide and conquer strategy for capital, which is intensely entwined with the patriarchy, the same power structures that marx talked about in eighteen sixty still control the world today and are oppressing both women and people in the third world and oppressed peoples in the developed world.
So we think that it's essential that we stop dividing the oppressed peoples of the earth and encourage them to see what they have in common, and part of that is ending this silo factor that we have right now, where everyone is in their own little group and not thinking about what they all have in common.
Now the other side's going to say, "" well, what about intersectional feminism? ""
But I think it's clear that this is just not going far enough, that we need to have mass movements that move across these bold twentieth century boundaries and that can encompass all people who are oppressed in order to create a better world without patriarchy, without states, without capitalism.
We can't do this right now because in many cases, feminism has been coopted by capital.
Hillary clinton is really the poster child of this.
I could just stop there.
But the fact that people think that you can be a neo-liberal who wants to murder children in yemen, like hillary clinton, and a feminist, just goes to show you the problem that we have right now, where the term has completely been coopted and a movement that claims to help people who are oppressed is actually helping, basically, white women to murder people in the third world, when it comes down to it.
The leaders of the developed world are using feminism as a tool of oppression globally, and the only way to stop that is to completely redefine how we talk about oppression.
Our second argument is that we think that the term "" feminism "" is trans-exclusionary.
So, I know that the other side is also gonna say, "" oh, well there's trans-inclusive feminism, "" but the very idea that gender discrimination is based solely on a male-female line is not really in line with our society today.
Maybe this wasn't as big a problem back in the first wave of feminism in the early twentieth century but today, when some of the most oppressed people, both in the developed and developing world, are people who are non-binary or outside of these traditional gender norms, I think it's clear that a movement that calls itself the women's liberation movement isn't really helping those people.
What's critical is that we step up to protect people who are gender minorities or who face gender discrimination, regardless of what their gender is.
And I'm not trying to make some meninist argument here.
Obviously, we're not talking about protecting men.
We're talking about making feminism into a movement that can include trans people without being just completely anachronistic and ridiculous, which is basically what you have right now with a lot of especially white, rich, supposedly trans-inclusive feminists.
And our final argument is that we think that it's important to spur intellectual development in the feminist movement.
Right now, there's a sort of feminist orthodoxy of people like bell hooks, who are great, but people haven't really moved beyond that.
We think that, for instance, the fact that the third wave of feminism has endured since the late nineteen eighties to today shows that feminism has kind of calcified and that one way to break that calcification and to encourage new ideas and new development and more radical change to help people would be to end feminism and to focus on the movement I described in my first argument.
For all of these reasons, we should abandon feminism.
Thank you."
"We should increase gun control.
First in this debate, it's important to specify what we mean, when we say we would increase gun control, so we have a few ideas in mind: the first is increased and mandatory gun registration.
The second is universal background checks and closing down black markets, such as gun shows, that allow people to exploit loopholes, and avoid getting background checks.
The third is bans on specific types of guns, such as assault rifles, high capacity magazines, and things of that nature, things that we simply think are not necessary for self defense, or for sport.
And fourthly, we would limit things like where and when people can carry, we think gun free zones, like schools and other areas of public interest, are good things to have, and we think that these are fairly reasonable restrictions, that create a balance between self defense, and the need to prevent gun violence.
So, we only really have one argument, but we think it's crucial: we simply think that it is common sense and the duty of the state to protect its people from what currently occurs with high volumes of gun deaths.
Statistics will show that, countries that have fewer guns in the streets, whether it's illegal black market guns, or just legally owned firearms, were less likely to have fatalities.
Recognize that, the majority of gun deaths don't come from homicides, but rather come from suicides, come from self harm, come from people getting a gun that wasn't registered to them, but is registered to a friend or family member, and doing harm with that.
Recognize that, the more prevalent guns are in our society, the more widely available they are, the easier it is for guns to trickle out to the black market, which means, aside from the massive amount of harm that comes from suicides and self harm, there's also a black market that is growing, because of our poor regulation of guns, and even if you believe that it's important to have the right to self defense, that right to self defense is undermined when we play so loose with how people are going to have guns in our country.
You need to ensure that, there are simple and reasonable checks to ensure that bad people, people that are likely to do harm with guns, or people that are simply not mentally stable enough to have a gun, someone that is mentally ill, someone, that is likely to do harm to themselves or others, should not be able to have a gun.
And while people say you can do harm with other things, it doesn't mean that guns aren't infinitely more deadly, and that these things aren't a serious problem.
And recognize, this is a serious problem in the status quo.
Homicides are on the rise, and suicides are in a massive high.
An easier access means a large black market.
When you have countries, like those in europe and japan, that have no guns that have either limited gun usage, or no guns at all, we think that, these countries just show empirically that there are fewer harms due to guns.
So, now let's talk about the right to life.
We think the right to life is the most important thing that people have, and as such, the government's most important priority is: protect that right to life.
We believe that, this means this outweighs any sort of nebulous right you have to self defense, and recognize that a right to self defense does not equate to a right to gun ownership.
I may have a right to speech, but I don't have a right to get a pedestal, where I can speak to five hundred thousand people, it's just that I have the ability to speak what I want.
And, your self defense rights aren't undermined by this, you can still have protections for yourself with a handgun, if you really think that you need a gun to protect yourself, or by having a home security system, or getting together with your neighbors, and deciding to have some some sort of neighborhood surveillance, or neighborhood watch program.
There are ways to ensure that you can be protected from violence, without having an assault rifle that can shoot sixty bullets out of one clip.
We simply think that, these are common sense restrictions that ensure that, when gun violence happens, it's easier to track down who did this violence, but overall, decreases the amount of violence, which we think saves lives and that's what the government exists to do.
And for use reasons, we should increase gun control."
"ADHD management brings more good than harm.
So I think what this debate is really about is whether or not the use of medications like ritalin and adderall to treat ADHD, especially for children, is a good thing.
And I think the wording of the topic necessarily means that this is comparative.
There's going to be some benefits and some drawbacks and both sides should acknowledge that, and we're talking about which is ultimately more important and which outweighs the other.
So we're going to talk first about why we think these treatments allow people with ADHD to lead more fulfilling lives.
So recognize that ADHD is an illness.
It's not that different than having a physical ailment.
And when people have a physical ailment that prevents them from working or going to school or living fulfilling lives we treat that ailment.
Even if there are drawbacks.
You know wearing a cast on a broken arm makes it more difficult to play soccer, say, but in the long run it'll make you better off and more able to participate in society so we're okay with that temporary drawback.
I think that for many people ADHD treatments work in a similar way.
Particularly for children there might be some drawbacks in terms of their ability to focus and succeed outside of school or some potential social harms to taking these medications but in the long term because they're able to get an education they're able to work and support themselves and help others better on our side.
So we think that particularly with educational success, many children with ADHD struggle to succeed in schools and not only did they struggle to succeed in their classes but they take away resources from other children because they demand more attention from educators.
So we think that these children and anyone else who's in class with them are better off if they're receiving treatment in the long term in terms of receiving educational success.
And this extends into the workplace as well.
Of course if people are educated and they're better able to get a job but also if you're receiving treatment and you're better able to succeed at that job, to train others to be productive, to help your company or whoever you work for and ultimately be a productive member of society in that respect as well.
We also think that your mental health is likely to be better.
Because people who struggle to find employment or to succeed educationally often experience anxiety or depression and we think that those can be mitigated by giving people the tools they need to succeed in work and education and that often means treating their ADHD.
So in the long term, we think that people with ADHD can better lead fulfilling happy lives as a result of these treatments.
So we think that they are something that's good on balance.
Certainly some people have adverse reactions, but we think that if you look at the broad scope of millions of people who are affected by this illness, more people are going to benefit them be harmed.
Our second point is on a more societal level.
We've talked about the individual, what's good for people as a whole.
So we think that many people who struggle with mental illness like ADHD struggle to participate in society.
They have are hard time getting an education and getting a job so they're dependent on things like government support or rely on family members to care for them even into adulthood and in general are not able to thrive and succeed as well as they should otherwise.
This is a tremendous cost because in order for society to provide for everyone in need everyone who's able bodied has to be able to work and to produce so that we can take care of those who can't support themselves.
This means that treatments that allow people to be able bodied, to be able to help others are going to be a good thing and we think that ADHD treatments are a good example of this where people who might otherwise not be contributing as much to society as others are now able to contribute a great deal and that means that we can support people who can't contribute like children, like the disabled, like people in need.
So I think that the comparative is much better off for people who can't help themselves.
We also think that you reduce any social behaviors.
If people can't succeed in the workplace, they're probably more likely to turn to crime and issues like that and we think that if you can reduce this by encouraging people to receive treatment for mental illness like ADHD that ultimately that's going to be good for society as well and make everyone safer.
So in the long run we think that society will be better off as a result of ADHD management techniques like certain drugs like adderall and ritalin.
So because this is good for individuals and for society we think that this does more good than harm.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should fight global warming.
We think the most important thing, to recognize in this round, is that long term safety is always more important, than short term economic gains.
This is true for two reasons, first we tell you that it doesn't matter how much money you have, if you are choking and are dead by the time that you are able to use it.
But second, that in the end money is temporary, but lives are permanent, and ending those lives is more so permanent.
We care more about the fact that people can be dying in the future, than we do about a couple million more dollars, in the pockets of those who are already millionaires.
Not only are they not going to be damaged by short term loss, but the people who are going to be damaged will be damaged much more harshly.
With that, two many areas of clash.
The first, on why we think that global warming is a short term, and long term threat, to the human race.
In the immediate future, we think that we already see signs of global warming, that can cause massive destruction to human infrastructure and livelihood, especially in the ways that we see rising waters sweeping out entire towns, and like groupings of people's homes.
Not only does this immediately remove these people's homes, and cause things like drownings, but more than this, we think that once these things are under water, there that besides these things being underwater, global warming also leads to the increasing of disease.
Things like west nile virus are seen moving farther and farther north, as the temperature changes to be more acceptable for them.
This destroys both individuals with diseases, that they were never acclimated to, and never would have expected, but also destroys the crops that feed them.
With large sweeping destruction of crops comes more human starvation, and more human suffering.
We think, even if you don't buy that we care about long term human lives, we think you do care about the way in which people die, and the way in which they suffer.
Because, the short order pleasure the second order pleasure that I get from spending that extra money is incomparable, to the fact that other people around me are suffering from a much higher order pain.
We think, at the point that they are actively being in pain and harmed, that's all that matters in this round.
We also think, that long term scientists have already explained why global warming will cause massive death in large numbers to the human race.
That overheating will essentially cause the heat of the earth, and and make it so that it is inhabitable to future generations.
We think, at the point that this impacts the the like the entirety of the future of mankind, this is the most important thing in the round.
Our second main area of clash has to do with the economics of global warming.
Because we think that the op will come up, and say a lot about why it's so economically detrimental to fight global warming, but we think it' the opposite is actually true.
We think that, as you lose land mass, it becomes more expensive to rebuild houses, and more expensive to rebuild that farmland elsewhere.
Not to mention, that you're losing oftentimes millions dollars worth of crop land and crops.
We think that when diseases spread to places they haven't been before, not only do they harm humans, but they also harm the crops, and the livestock, that create economic impetus in that area.
Once you do that, you destroy the market for those things, and it damages trade relations.
We think, generally, these are things that are bad for the economy, and we prefer for these regional and local economics to be better, rather than, on the like higher end of the pyramid, for a couple more millionaires to donate a couple more million dollars into the market, that operates outside of the sphere of the common man anyway.
More than this, we think that global warming, and the fight for global warming, drives innovation, in a way that we currently just don't.
Coming up with new green technologies, and being able to market those things, are all very good for good for the economy, and good for trade relations, within like a more global sphere.
We think, at the point that you're actually going to be taking the market out of stagnation on our side of the house, economics is also on the side of fighting global warming.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should end development aid.
By we we mean the united states.
We think it's still fine to have other forms of aid, like often there is tied aid or there's military aid, we're fine with that, we just think that funds earmarked for development are irresponsible and shouldn't occur.
Two main areas of clash, first on creating dependency.
Because recognize the problem with development aid is that it is money going into a system that basically says like use this for development, but doesn't actually establish a source by which they can replace that revenue into the long term.
So like the hope is that maybe they will develop enough that they are developing new spheres of commerce or things, the problems is this is very rarely the way that it works.
Like money earmarked for development often goes to like very infrastructure based things, it doesn't really attract new business or create new business, or goes into like social health care.
And the problem with this is that it means you require that money to continue in the form of aid.
We think this is actually really bad for the countries that require development aid because it means that when we get into a sticky political situation, like I don't know trump gets elected and he really doesn't believe in helping other countries with our money, that money can get cut off but there isn't a replacement, and they have no way of coping with that.
So we think that even if it is something that is difficult, we think that a more stable country is ultimately achieved if they figure out streams of revenue and stability on their own.
Like we think the problem is that there are like there are two issues here.
First, we don't think that the united states should carry on a like consistent long term obligation to keep doling out money, but second, we just think it's really bad for these countries when they find themselves in situations where the money is gone but the need is still there, and they haven't developed any alternative sources of revenue.
It's also just bad for their economy because it allows the economy to stagnate, there's not actually an impetus to change or develop in any meaningful way, in that like if you have this money coming in, you might as well just like continue doing other things in the meantime.
So we think what happens also on their side of the house is that rather than putting money into like developing new sectors of commerce etcetera, they put it into the easiest stuff that can satisfy the people the fastest so they can stay in office, like political incentives lined up, and then they don't have anything when that money ends.
We also think that there are a lot of semi-despotic regimes in a lot of these areas, like the venezuelan like prime minister, or like a lot of the smaller countries where even though it's like not full on despotic regime, it's a lot of corruption going on, so we think that this money doesn't get utilized efficiently either, and we think that that's also a problem.
Our second area of clash is about prioritizing your own population.
Recognize that the government has a hierarchy of obligation.
IE, you have your people first, and we think that the reason for this is incredibly intuitive.
Insofar as these are the people who monetarily pay their taxes to you, insofar as these are the people who elect like positions to office, like insofar as all of that is going on, these are the people who you serve first.
And we think that this also has an alternative way of enforcement, and that these are also the people who can usurp you if they feel like they're not putting them first often enough, so this obligation works in both directions.
So this obligation just like exists, like you ought put your people first because of all the things they do, but if you don't, then the people have a check on you as well.
And we think that even if they like comparatively there are people in the united states who suffer and their suffering is less than other countries, it is still the case that there are many people in the united states who don't have homes, who don't have jobs, who don't have like basic needs fulfilled, and we think that it is the job of the united states government to solve those problems first, before they go on to solve other countries' problems.
This is both because it is an obligation, but also because if you are able to get your country to function at optimal, then you are also able to produce more economically, so you are able to do things like provide aid in other ways to other countries later.
Proud to propose."
"Covenant marriage brings more good than harm.
So covenant marriage is essentially something that's been put into place in a handful of US states like louisiana, where when a couple gets married rather than a normal marriage that can be dissolved unilaterally by either partner, a covenant marriage is much more difficult to dissolve.
In order to enter into a covenant marriage people have to go through a certain amount of counseling and they have to sign a document that says that they agree that it would be very difficult for them to ever dissolve this covenant marriage, that they understand that this is pretty much a lifetime commitment.
So here's why we think it does more good than harm.
But before we get into our arguments, I'd just like to point out that when we talk about more good than harm obviously there's benefits and harms to both sides, but we think that there is ultimately we're going to be able to outweigh the harms with the good.
So two arguments.
The first is about why we get more choice for individuals on our side of the house.
Why is this a good thing?
First, we tell you that choice is tremendously important because it allows people to make decisions with as little government interference as possible.
We see that if there were no state, that people would probably have more ability to make individual decisions about how they want to live their lives but that the state limits those in some ways such as by establishing marriage contracts that differ from what individuals might come up with purely on their own.
We think that by allowing people who want to enter a covenant marriage to enter in because obviously no one's being coerced into this, if you are getting married in the US and you're coerced than the contract would be overturned in court.
So we see that people want to enter into this and we think that ultimately it is always preferable to defer to giving people the ability to do what they want when they're not harming other people.
This maximizes their freedom.
So does this maximize freedom becomes the question.
Does this give people more choice?
Well we see that at the point where people aren't being coerced and where they are choosing to opt into covenant marriage that this must fulfill some need that people have.
We think that in particular many conservative christians especially in the US where this has been popular, feel alienated by the increased rate of divorce and these people want to ensure that they don't make a mistake in the future.
This is a lot like getting insurance on your marriage basically against divorce in the future, that they don't do something that is contrary to their own value system.
They want to take a step to prevent a poor decision in the future.
We let people do things like this all the time.
We let people invest for retirement even though they could probably save on their own etcetera.
So we don't think that this is something that is completely unheard of for the state to allow people to enter into these restrictive contracts.
So at the day we do think that this maximizes choice and that this is ultimately going to outweigh the harms of people having limited choice in the future because they entered into this covenant.
Ultimately they freely opted in.
We're okay with that.
Our second argument is that this protects the partner who is less well off.
So if you think about divorce, generally in a marriage you're gonna have one partner who is making more money or has more resources than the other partner.
You might see that in a more traditional marriage maybe the husband owns the house and the car and has a really good job and the wife has been put her own career on hold in order to raise their children etcetera.
So obviously in that situation the wife would be in a really difficult position if the husband were to file for divorce and you know today things are a little different, maybe it will be the wife or maybe it would be a same sex marriage and you would have a different partner be better off, but the point still holds.
Now what we see is that yes in the status quo there's some effort made to assign some amount of the common property of the marriage to the partner who is less well off, but ultimately we think that these people should be able to take another step in order to protect themselves in the long term because if you put your career on hold you can never undo that.
If you choose to take time away from work or education that's something that will set back your income for the rest of your life.
So we think that you should be able to enter into a very strict contract in order to protect your investment of time into this marriage.
So for these two reasons we think that covenant marriages bring more good than harm.
Thank you."
"We should introduce recall elections.
So, to begin, we're going to give a model of how we think this would look, and then we're going to explain the principle that this is based on, before explaining how the pragmatic benefits would accumulate, if we introduced recall elections.
Okay, so, we think that recall elections are generally going to take place at the state level, we don't think that it is feasible to have a national recall election, but at least at the state level, we think it would be initiated via a petition of twenty percent of registered voters in the area of the representative.
So, what this means is that if some state if constituents of that person want to recall them, they would need to get a petition of twenty percent of the population that is registered to vote.
Which means that, if you're child, you couldn't sign this petition, if you're not registered to vote you couldn't sign this petition, and this is so that you ensure that those that have a stake in the election are those that can have a stake in the recall.
Okay, so we think that the principle behind this is very simple: we think that democracy, while it is certainly flawed, is the best way to aggregate the preferences of the people.
We think that term lengths are, in and of themselves, arbitrary, and that allowing recall elections, allows for people not to be bound by these terms lengths.
We think that this is incredibly important, because oftentimes these term lengths ensure that individuals that become incredibly unpopular, elected officials with approval ratings below thirty percent, below forty percent, people that simply don't have the trust of the public, continue to stay in office.
We think that this is problematic, and while in some instances, we think that there may be a misuse of judgment, by those that are recalling the person, in the vast majority of instances, we think when people would be recalled, these are legitimate instances, in which that person is failing in their role as a as a representative of the people, because they no longer represent the popular will of those that elected them.
So, we think that there are some massive pragmatic gains that come from this, in instances where there could be a recall.
First, we think that there are instances in which elected officials are corrupt, and what this means is that when you recall these people, you ensure that you're moving corrupt officials from office, and these are often instances in which there isn't enough evidence that this person would go to jail, or a legal process would be much longer than a recall process.
We think that recall can ensure that corrupt officials are removed from office, which is crucial to avoid an abuse of power.
We also think that the potential of recall always holds elected officials to the fire.
Means that, you know that you're not safe, and you're not bound to your term, but rather if you are doing a poor job, if you're acting in a way in which individuals, that you are representing, do not approve of what you're doing, you can be removed from office.
And this is important, because oftentimes elected officials will behave in ways that go against their constituents, but because the the public memory is a very short term thing, what this results is people shifting their position, once an election becomes closer, and these individuals end up winning reelection.
But, we think that this only involves a cycle of abuse, in which people are able to abuse the fact, that the public is not able to be constantly vigilant, and constantly aware, and they're not able to recall.
What this means is that, if you have recall elections for the entirety of the term, people are more likely to be representative of their constituents, rather than them shifting to be representative when it comes time to have an election again.
We simply think that a direct democracy leads to a more satisfied constituency, it leads to a voting body that is more likely to be happy with the actions of their elected officials, and it ensures that in those cases, in which those elected officials have clearly failed to represent their people, the people that voted them into office, we think that recall elections are invaluable tool.
And for these reasons, we should introduce recall elections."
"We should abolish the double jeopardy offense.
So, what we think is important in this round is to recognize that the principle of double jeopardy simply doesn't make sense, and that we think it is principally bad for law and for justice to allow the double jeopardy defense to be a thing.
We think that we would prefer a world in which, if there is a trial and someone is found to be innocent, that, if there is an investigation that reveals that more evidence is available, that prosecutors can bring forth the trial once again, and that you would obviously, as a defendant, have the same rights, the same respect, the same rights and respect given to you in the future.
We just simply don't think that, if you are guilty of an offense, you should be able to walk away, because jury got it wrong, and that's what double jeopardy allows to have.
So firstly, why this is principally bad, and second, why we don't think this is going to be abused in a meaningful way.
So firstly on principle.
We think, that justice requires seeking truth, and that the timeline of trials is often expedited, because evidence tends to disappear, or break down over time.
So, what we think is the problem is that there, in the status quo, there are pragmatic issues that cut against the need for true justice, for principally just outcomes.
This means that people are often rushed to trial, because they know that if they don't rush to trial, that evidence could disappear, that someone could get away, that all these things could happen, that make your case deteriorate, and therefore people prosecutor specifically are rushed to trial.
What this means is that it's often the case, that people if they'd been given more time to gather evidence, if they had been given more time to plan their prosecution, that they otherwise could have found someone guilty, they could have proved that someone was guilty beyond a a reasonable doubt, but they simply didn't have the time or the ability to do so.
We think that this is a problem, because if you aren't able to determine the truth of an outcome, if you aren't able to take the time to really figure out what happened in a crime, it's impossible to carry out justice, only the veneer of justice.
And therefore, we think that if justice dictates that a prior trial is incorrect, because there is clear and compelling evidence that the result of the jury was incorrect, then we think it's clearly the case, that this person still committed a moral wrong, they still did something bad, and that the truth of the matter is that this person must be punished, because otherwise, society is complicit in their wrongdoing, society is willing to allow an offender go free.
We don't think that's fair.
We think the justice system can get a decision wrong, especially with an amateur jury, this doesn't mean the facts of the case are different.
Criminals go free, and they're more more likely to commit crimes in the future.
So, people that have already committed criminal offenses are in circumstances, in which they're more likely to commit criminal offenses in the future, and so if you let someone go free, even though it's very clear that they are guilty, we think you're more likely to put society in danger.
That goes against the obvious rights of the innocent in society.
So, three reasons why we don't think that this is likely to be abused.
One, trials are very expensive.
It costs a lot of money and a lot of resources to gather a jury, to put together a courtroom, to put together evidence, to bring in expert witnesses, to do all these things, trials are just a a very costly and very expensive process, that we don't think would be used unless there is clear evidence that someone got away with a crime.
Secondly, prosecutors care about their reputation, they care about how they're viewed within the courtroom, how they're viewed in the criminal justice system, and therefore we don't think prosecutors are likely to try to bring forward a case for a second time, unless they're very confident that they will be able to get a conviction.
This is why a lot of cases don't go to trial the first time, it's because prosecutors are afraid they won't be able to get a conviction.
So we don't think that this is going to be used on cases, in which it's not clear if you could get a conviction.
And finally, we you need new evidence to open the case, so you couldn't just retry someone immediately after a case have been ended.
It would only be if new evidence came forward, that make this clear.
And, just because you got new evidence, from a case, after the trial ended, doesn't mean that the evidence isn't a preponderance of the facts, it doesn't mean that that evidence doesn't hold value about the truth of a crime, and it doesn't mean that that evidence isn't meaningful.
But given that you need new evidence, we think that you're unlikely to go to trial, unless this meaningful new evidence comes forward, and all these other conditions are met.
So, we don't think that the justice system is going to plague people that get away every single time someone is found innocent.
We think it's only going to be used in very limited circumstances, but that those limited circumstances are crucial for ensuring justice is carried out.
This is why we should abolish the double jeopardy defense."
"We should further exploit wind turbines.
What we mean by this is that we think that as, like, the US, as a community as the government, we would prefer a world in which we used and explored more wind turbines than we do in the status quo.
Three main areas of clash: first on why it's good for the environment.
Recognize that the amount of energy that we need remains relatively consistent based on the population and the region.
So, sure, if we experience a major population spike, our demand for energy will increase.
But aside from that, our demand for energy is relatively stable, because people live predictable lives that involve the same general categories of energy use.
What this means is that what we can what changes is not how much energy we need but rather by what method we get that energy.
No one is going to argue against the fact that there are better and worse ways in which to obtain energy to power your life, IE, fossil fuels and that release greenhouse gases is something we recognize that although it provides energy, is really bad for the individual person and that person's community.
So we think that when we say, "" hey, use more wind turbines, "" it's always going to come at the cost of using other forms of energy, primarily fossil fuels, because that's the majority of what we use in the status quo.
Because we don't need something to provide access energy, we just need something to replace the mechanisms that exist in the status quo for producing the same amount of energy that we've needed for the last decade.
So, why are wind turbines better?
First, there isn't the same kind of greenhouse effect that you get from fossil fuels.
They're not going to make the energy the the air more difficult for you to breathe.
There won't be any smog, and there won't be any ozone layer deteriorating above your head.
Also, it is infinitely easier to obtain.
You're not sending people down into mines.
You're not infecting the groundwater using fracking, rather you're just building large wind turbines that sit calmly in the middle of a field and produce energy without actually having the same kind of byproducts that you get from the process of procuring on other forms.
We also think that oftentimes it is preferable to things like solar power and other forms because when you're up at a high enough altitude, there's always going to be consistent wind, which can't be true of something like the sun going in and out.
Our second area of clash is about unseating fossil fuels.
We've already gone a little bit into this.
This is something that is necessarily going to trade off with the use of fossil fuels in the status quo, but what it's also going to do is signal to other to gas companies and other good energy companies there's now a demand for for an alternative to fossil fuels.
In the status quo, we allow fossil fuel companies to have a monopoly.
They lobby our politicians.
They control the majority of our energy market.
And the way in which we unseat that is by showing that there exists a space for other groups to come in.
Because currently, it's really risky to be an outlier in the energy market that doesn't dabble in fossil fuels because you're not going to sell.
So, create an economic incentive.
Signal that here there's an opportunity that you can take advantage of that will promote your business as well as things that are generally healthier decision for the decisions for the rest of society.
We also think then the united states can create this technology and use the first-mover advantage to to their benefit.
So, other countries are still being relatively slow on the uptick when it comes to promoting better energy use.
So, even though like japan is pretty good at this, countries like china, countries like france and england are all still massive emitters.
We think that coming up with this technology is, first, good for jobs and things like that in the united states, but also good because if we come up with it first, we can sell it to others.
Our third area of clash is about why it's necessary.
Recognize, first and foremost, we're just running out of fossil fuels, like, it's not something that is going to continue to exist into the long, long term.
This means we have to do two things: first, replace the energy that fossil fuels provided that we're not going to have any more but second, replace the jobs that were tied up in fossil fuels that are no longer going to exist.
We think wind turbines fulfill both of those areas.
Proud to propose."
"We should ban factory farming.
In this debate, we're going to make two broad arguments about why factory farming or farming in large-scale large-scale industry farming should not be allowed.
The first is about animal rights, and the second is about global warming.
First, on animal rights: we would say that rights are not just something that come out of the universe or from our existence, but are rather an emergent property of human societies.
What this means is that we think that in order to rights in order for rights to be binding, they need to be consistent and objective, because there needs to be some sort of standard that our societies can use when applying those rights.
This is how we distinguish rights from simple desires and in reality, the maxim that we use when we're determining rights is maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain.
We think that all rights systems, whether they're deontologically-based or whether they're based on utilitarian concerns or anything else, they essentially boil down to those principles.
So, why should animals have rights based on this idea?
So, just because we cannot internalize and understand animal pain and pleasure in the same way that we can with other humans, it doesn't mean that these emotions don't exist and that they shouldn't be valued.
We think that denying animals rights would be creating an arbitrary distinction.
It would be saying even though animals can feel pain and pleasure, even though those are the maxims that we look to avoid or minimize and maximize, that we're going to just arbitrarily say they don't deserve to have any sort of rights protections.
And recognize: this doesn't mean that animals need to have all the same rights protections as humans, it just means that they're deserving of some basic protections that are involved in animal pain and pleasure.
So, for example, the freedom of speech is an important human freedom because our freedom of speech inhibits or progresses our pain and pleasure in the world, whereas animals don't need these types of rights.
But factory farming undermines very basic rights that animals should have, such as the animals' rights to simply live a comfortable life, to roam in open spaces, to be able to live in a way that isn't constantly full of pain, and factory farms violate these in a in many ways.
Firstly, it's probably the case, based on these ideas, that we shouldn't eat animals, but let's ignore that for a second.
Saying we can, what are the kind of situations that these animals are placed in?
Well, they're put in incredibly small cages with very little room to spread out, to walk around, to breed, and these are all things that go directly against their animal instincts and cause them immense amounts of emotional distress.
There's also no emotional well-being because in the in the factory, you just aren't able to form connections and communities with other animals along with you.
There's also rampant disease and lots of antibiotics that cause the health of these animals to decline.
And finally, these animals literally exist to be killed.
Their life is a constant series of degradation and pain.
We think that this obviously violates the rights they deserve to have.
Secondly, we're going to talk briefly about global warming.
Factory farming is a huge contributor to global warming and ecological degradation.
So even if you don't think animals deserve to have rights, we think that global warming poses a threat to all human rights, and factory farming impacts this.
The major way in which factory farming impacts this is that when you have such industrial-scale farming, huge amounts of methane are released from both cows, pigs and other animals.
And this is a shockingly large contributor to global warming, and methane is a greenhouse gas that contributes to the warming of the earth.
We think that this this impact that these animals have is reason enough that we should at least eliminate factory farms.
It would result in less meat if we just had normal farming practices in which animals were raised in more agrarian styles, and this is good because fewer animals are exhuming less methane, which leads to less global warming in the long run.
So even if you don't think animals deserve to have any rights, we think that shifting our style of farming from factory farming, by banning factory farming, is good for our own human preservation.
For these reasons, we should ban factory farming."
"We should introduce school vouchers.
So, school vouchers are basically a system where you're able to take the money that you contributed to taxes for your local public school and use that money to send your children to a private school.
So let's say you were assessed ten thousand dollars in property tax for education in a given year, you would be able to petition to get a voucher for ten thousand dollars to spend on tuition at a private school for your children, if you so chose.
This is already the case in some parts of the united states, and we think that western liberal democracies everywhere should implement some version of this policy.
With that in mind, two main arguments.
The first is about why we think this leads to better education.
Right now, there's basically no competition within education.
Children go to their neighborhood school and if it's a good school, they get a good education and if it's a bad school, then they don't.
But, there's no competition here, because people can't say, "" my school is bad.
I want to go to another school. ""
Now it might be true that a few very wealthy people are able to send their children to private schools and pay property taxes, but these are a small minority of parents, in general.
We think that, therefore, the competition is false, because schools know that they can provide a poor service, bad education, and still receive thousands of customers, namely, the children who live in their district.
So we think that we would get better education with school vouchers, because you would see money flowing into good schools and away from bad schools.
That would mean that the bad schools would have to adapt themselves and their education in order to attract people back into going to that school.
If they can't do so, then they'll probably go out of business, and we think that's a good thing if it means that children are getting a better education.
Ultimately, remember: the purpose of school is to educate young people, not to employ teachers or provide a local sports team that people can root for.
So, if on our side, we get better education, we get young people who are more civically engaged, who are more prepared for university, who are ready to vote, then we think that that's the highest good possible.
And we certainly get that on our side, because we allocate money to the schools that are doing those things and force the schools that aren't to go out of business, which will then create a void that will lead to new schools opening up so that, therefore, children will actually have access to a good education.
This is clearly good for children who are served by bad schools right now, because those are the people falling through the cracks.
In our world, it would be possible for people to get some of that money that they already pay in back and to use it to better themselves and their children.
Our second main argument is about parental choice.
Right now, we let parents make a lot of important decisions about their children's education.
If you want your children to go to sunday school, if you want them to learn spanish on the weekend, or go to math camp and all of these other things that parents do to provide for their children's education, those are all personal choices.
So why should the school that your children go to not be a personal choice?
Again, the other team might point out that some people go to catholic or private schools, but we tell you that ultimately it's a false choice, because most people simply can't afford that.
We think that, first of all, given that parents have a right to make decisions about their children, we think that that right should apply equally to all people, not just the very wealthy who can afford to send their kids to private schools, in the status quo.
And secondly, I want to talk about where that right comes from.
Parents know their own children better than the government does.
Governments might have statistical data about what's good for children, on aggregate, but they don't know if little johnny has certain needs that aren't being met by public schools and things like that.
So we think that it's always going to be better to defer to parents to make these decisions than to try to make them at a centralized level.
We think that this is particularly true for the parents of special needs children who are going to be more able to provide for their children using these vouchers than they would in the status quo at public schools that often don't have facilities for special needs children.
So for these reasons, we should implement school vouchers.
Thank you."
"We should adopt slow food.
Slow food is a culinary movement that began in italy as a reaction against the proliferation of fast food in that country but now has spread globally, and we think that more and more people ought consider the benefits that this has to offer them and their community when they make decisions about how and where to eat.
So a bit about what slow food is.
Slow food focuses on preparing foods for each individual rather than mass producing foods, on using local and traditional measures rather than industrializing food production, like you'd see at something like mcdonald's, and oftentimes focuses on providing a better quality of food, both in terms of health and also just the the appeal of the food to the consumer.
This is something that people can do at home but there are also restaurants that are devoted to the principles of slow food, and this includes many traditional restaurants around the world.
So our first argument is that this would be good for promoting regional culture.
I read that the beginning of slow food was when mcdonald's was going to open up near the spanish steps in rome, and people were up in arms that such a major site for italian culture was going to have a mcdonald's there.
Having been to rome now, I would say that there's a mcdonald's on every corner, but one great thing about the slow food movement is that it gives people an alternative that really captures what that region is about.
The slow food that you get in rome is going to be different than what I can get in los angeles, is going to be different than what you can get in tel aviv or kuala lumpur or whatever city you pick.
By its nature, it encourages people to cook the way that their parents taught them and to take their time with it, so this encourages people to learn about their local food culture and also to pass it on to their children, something which may not happen if people become more dependent on a sort of globalized, very industrialized type of food production that we sometimes see.
So I think that's a major benefit and that this can ultimately be an important tool in preserving local food cultures around the world.
And if we've seen anything from this kind of foodie revolution of the last few decades, it's that there absolutely is value to having diverse food cultures around the world and that it's part of what makes different regions special and what gives people their identity.
So we think it's something that's worth preserving absolutely.
Our second argument is about people's health.
When people put a lot of effort into preparing their food and doing things the right way, we think that they're much more aware of what they eat.
Nobody is going to just make a cup of soda and put ten tablespoons of sugar into it or whatever is in a cup of pepsi if they can actually see what they're putting into their body.
Fast food and processed food have hidden from people how unhealthy our diets are, how full of corn syrup and sodium and all of these other awful things that we wouldn't normally eat our diets have become.
But with slow food people are eating the way that people are supposed to.
They're eating healthier diets and because of that, people are able to better control their weight and oftentimes live longer and avoid illness.
So I think that there's a very real benefit to people's health from the slow food movement.
And the last thing that we'd argue is that this can help to build communities.
So I think this is distinct from regional food because oftentimes you don't have to be from a region or involved in a region to appreciate their cuisine.
One of the great things about the slow food movement in the US has been that we've seen a lot of new fusion cuisines emerge and a lot of new types of food emerge that people wouldn't have seen otherwise, and this has facilitated the development of new communities such as vegetarian and vegan communities around the united states.
Whereas previously, because a lot of mass produced food doesn't cater to these groups, it would have been much more difficult to have many people convert over to veganism or vegetarianism, much less to have a community, today we have many restaurants that serve those groups and offer them a place to have a community.
So for all of these reasons, we should consider adopting slow food.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should increase international volunteering.
We think this would mostly take place in developing countries insofar as those are the ones that need it most and it's just really unlikely that germany would give a give any kind of care for people coming in to volunteer for them if they're doing okay.
And we think it will also take the form of anything between like people getting formal positions within other states government to someone coming in with an NGO, like amnesty international or any other group like doctors without borders, that do work across across country.
Ways to enforce this it might be like a mandatory x number of years or months volunteering abroad.
We think more likely what would happen is that there would just be a lot of education campaigns as to how volunteering abroad can help you and like a social value on volunteering abroad.
With that three main areas of clash: first on affecting social good.
Developing countries struggle for many reasons: lacks of a lack of resources, manpower, money, too much corruption, and but like a really good thing about this is that volunteers undercut a lot of these problems.
They don't really paid, they often come with their own resources and they can fill a lot of gaps that are hard to find manpower for.
So just boring government jobs or traveling with NGO's that pass up really necessary food and medicines that people would otherwise not have access to.
In this way they also undercut government corruption by providing directly to the individuals who need them most.
We think this can be really helpful in providing for those who can't who can't provide for themselves, who need it more, but also targets young populations that would be doing less important or impactful stuff back home.
We think that a lot of the time individuals after college would just be entering the workforce right away and so we think that it's a good one instead they can go help others and then enter the workforce afterwards.
Like in a choice between going on to your job right away or spending a few months abroad, we think it would be like very good for them to first go help others before they come back and do things for themselves.
We also think that it creates individuals that believe in community values and cooperation which is generally good as like contributors to society.
Our second area of clash is about cultural exposure.
People from different countries tend to live in echo chambers.
They're exposed to one majority culture for their life and they create, and this creates narrow minded individuals that are more likely to believe stereotypes and propaganda because they're never actually exposed to the reality so they just believe whatever their state feeds them.
We think that more international volunteering encourages a cross national pollination.
People learn new ideas and experiences and leave with better opinions of other nations and cultures.
It's a lot harder to straw-man one group of people as lazy or especially violent or specially uneducated if you go and meet them and see their circumstances.
So we think that you actually end up with individuals that think a lot better about other nations and this encourages corporations between different groups, when the stereotypes in those nations can also be disbanded.
Like we think a lot of the time other countries have perceptions of people in western powers etcetera as like a certain type of person that can never be helpful to them and we think it's good when you take away that stereotype.
Our third area of clash is about fulfilling obligations.
Large western states screwed up a lot of smaller less developed states through things like british colonialism and imperialism, US hegemony in trade, US pushing certain countries to specialize in one type of thing because they would buy their product.
A lot of these things really changed the way that countries developed and hindered them a lot.
Within that you help alleviate this and help fulfill some of that obligation that you've created by screwing them over over and over again, by sending over individuals that can now help you develop and help like promote a better world.
So we think insofar as there's like an obligation created by the fact that these larger nations took something from these smaller nations, that has taken them hundreds of years to recover from, we think that you ought to be internationally volunteering.
For these reasons proud to propose."
"We should lower the drinking age.
We should lower it everywhere and we should probably lower it to sixteen, maybe eighteen, definitely below twenty one, and the reason that we should do this is twofold: first and foremost, on a practicality level, as far as sensible regulation of act of drinking, and secondarily as far as rights are concerned.
So let's start by talking about responsible usage.
I think the first and most important thing to note is that the drinking age is the biggest joke in the entire world and as somebody who is now just who is now twenty one but has nevertheless been drinking for many years now, I think that if you ask just about any person in most countries, certainly in america, they tell you that there's a variety of ways in which an underage person can get alcohol and that the drinking age is entirely unenforced.
You can get it from an older friend, you can get it from a lot of parents who don't care because when they were in high school the drinking age was eighteen, you can get it from with a fake ID.
Years a whole, there's like an endless flow of ways in which alcohol is just accessible to people.
So, given that we operate in a world in which alcohol is going to be accessible to minors and that this isn't going to change because of deeply ingrained social structures that make alcohol a part of our culture, the focus shouldn't be can we get people underage to stop drinking, the focus should be how can we make sure that people who are underage drink responsibly.
So I think that the first thing that you want to do is not make people be afraid to call the police or be afraid to call an emergency or like the EMT's if somebody for example drinks too much, or if somebody is possibly getting like sick from drinking too much.
And I think that this is a real problem in a lot of like parties and things like that where because there's a real fear of consequences, there's a real fear of getting in trouble, people don't wanna tell the authorities when things got out of hand.
So you're less likely, first and foremost, to see partying happen in a responsible way and you're less likely see drinking happen in a responsible way secondarily, when you're not allowed to drink legally you're more likely going to do this in less safe places.
The drinking is more likely going to happen in the basement of a fraternity or the basement of like or like or in a high school party, than at a bar or somewhere where it's like public and a lot more able to be regulated.
So I think that that's another thing that's incredibly important.
But I think it additionally when you have a drinking age, it creates more of an an allure or more of a taboo or more of a glorification around drinking that makes us that people are more likely to over do it, so that people are more likely to use it as an act of rebellion and that people are more likely to essentially drink as like a symbol of independence.
A a symbol of having fun in your youth.
And I think this is very clearly something that we see right now and it's a big reason why like for example risks of binge drinking or over using too much alcohol are much more prevalent and places in america than they are in more some european countries where it's much more normalized and there's not the same kind of allure.
But the final thing that I wanna talk about is right.
Because I think that the idea that if your eighteen, or even if you're younger, you're an independent person with autonomy, with agency, with dignity and worth, who can make decisions about their life.
Who can decide whether or not it's good or bad for them to have a shot of alcohol, who can decide whether or not it's good for bad for them to have a glass of wine at night.
I think this is an incredibly basic decision that the average the average teenager is entirely capable of making.
It's not like you're buying a car or something like that, where you're spending tens of thousands of dollars, or in something that's going to affect you for years on end.
We're talking about things that are only going to affect you for one night, that aren't ultimately that big of a deal and are perfectly reasonable decisions for people to make.
We let people buy like sandwiches.
I don't see why alcohol is all that much why it's all that different.
Just because something affects your brain does not mean that you shouldn't be able to like use it as long as you can use it responsibly.
And the assumption that young people cannot do something responsibly is obscenely ageist to the many responsible young people, and to the many people who simply do not fit into these stereotypes.
So for all those reasons we should lower the drinking age."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should introduce covenant marriage.
What we mean by this is not that this would become the only type of marriage recognized within the eyes of the law but rather that in addition to regular marriage, states would allow individuals the option of entering into a covenant marriage as they are like going through the process of choosing to get married.
So, we're literally just providing it as an option for individuals.
Three main areas of clash: first on maximizing personal choice.
We think that the government shouldn't be forcing anyone into situations in that they don't desire to be in, but simultaneously they probably shouldn't be enforcing individuals not to put themselves into certain situations, unless they meet like a certain standard of harm.
Like we think that insofar as the government wouldn't be forcing anyone into covenant marriage on our side of the house, you're just giving people the ability to choose when it is preferable, but also recognize the purpose of the government is to actualize the preferences of the individuals that make up their constituency.
Clearly, there's enough preference for this option to exist insofar as some states already have it there and people have been using it.
We think it's actively paternalizing to not allow its use then.
We think that individuals know their own contexts and preferences better than anyone else would, including the government, and as such, they're the only ones who can rightfully opt in or opt out.
Opposition will come up here and they'll tell you that individuals can't consent to these kinds of systems, but realistically it's unclear why.
We're not providing you with an infinite barrier to divorce, and also these people are adults.
At the point that it's still possible for them to leave these situations, we just make it a little bit harder.
And at the point that these are individuals who have presumably been around the block, have like built their own conceptions of relationships, like no one is forcing twelve-year-olds to get married, they have some kind of map of the world and their own lives, then we think that there's not actually a world in which the government gets away with saying they can't consent.
We also think it's just a better world when people get as much freedom as possible.
We think even the freedom to make themselves less free is something that ought be protected insofar as it's just pragmatic to a certain extent.
Like literally every contract ever allows us to make ourselves less free or dedicate ourselves to a specific cause, because of these like because it's like pragmatically best for us to be able to tie ourselves down to a job, and we recognize that business incentives exist.
I think at the point that this is how people self-actualize, it is not on the part of the government to tell them "" no "", with no like real standard as to why.
Our second area of clash is about respecting religion.
Separation of church and state means that the government can't shine disfavor on religion either.
We think that this is actually an incredibly discriminatory policy when you don't have covenant marriage insofar as it is placing an exclusive block in the face of religious individuals and no one else, and we think that that's like bad and prevents them from being able to live more autonomously and access their religious freedoms.
Our third area of clash is about benefits, because we think there are some things that are just good about these kinds of marriages.
Like requiring things like prior prior counseling is something that the government probably should feel incredibly in favor of insofar as this is a massive decision that people often jump into much too quickly.
So we think that having some sort of barrier that requires you to educate yourself before you get married is probably good, but we're also fine with putting certain barriers in the front of divorce.
At the end of the day, marriage is a massive commitment that ties you economically and physically to an and emotionally to an individual in ways that dating never can make you.
At the point that this is true and it's such a big commitment, we don't think that it should be incredibly easy for someone to back out of that commitment, and we think that the weighing calculus to enter into it in the first place ought be relatively swayed to the side of not doing so, like to make sure that you really are like sure that you're going to do it.
We also think that at the point that divorces come at a fairly high cost to outside individuals, it should be relatively difficult to get one.
Like if you're a child and your parents are in the middle of getting a divorce, that's something which is really difficult for you to handle and ought be recognized, and probably ought be prevented as much as possible in these situations.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should ban the church of scientology.
The model for this is really simple.
Obviously, we don't think that you can mandate personal beliefs.
We think that people who might believe in these kinds of cult-like practices are going to exist on both sides of the house and we can't change that, but we can make it so that the church of scientology isn't recognized as a church by the government, so it loses its tax exempt status and can no longer call itself a religion.
In this way, we ban the church scientology from presenting itself as an official doctrine or an official religion that is sanctioned by the state.
Three main arguments, first on why it is not a real religion.
Recognize that the church of scientology is literally just a moneymaking organization.
It is made up of an elite class that makes millions and millions of dollars by charging the average person who joins the church for things they say are necessary to be members, like clearing services and other similar things that they say will help them to become better believers, but in reality are just padding the pockets of individuals who are already ridiculously wealthy.
It operates as a pyramid scheme.
They tell people they're more likely to go to heaven if they bring in more people and spend more of their own money, and we think it's incredibly problematic to require our religions to to to as a religion require people to consistently pay so much money in order to be a member at the point that this is literally going to be like creating these kinds of divisions, both in terms of class but also in terms of like the emotional state of these individuals who participate in this.
We think that you we we if we don't require our religion to prove some amount of religiosity, then we just allow any group to qualify for being tax exempt and other religion-based benefits.
So if we win this kind of argument, you're automatically going to vote to ban the church of scientology because if all it's doing is making money rather than the services that we think churches are meant to provide and the reason that they get their tax exempt status, like spiritual relievement and community, then that is not a religion and ought not be called one.
Our second argument is that they have committed so many crimes that they ought be disqualified from their religious status.
They have problematic black sites called the rehabilitation project force where people have died because they have refused to convert.
They capture people and literally torture them to death.
There have been a lot of organized harassment claims.
The church will compile kill files on people and use it to blackmail them.
They force people to talk about their deepest traumas and embarrassments during the church services in order to have something to keep on them later and to prevent them from leaving if they try, and they even tried to take over the government through infiltration via operation snow white.
They sold documents from the IRS and wiretaps communication.
It is really problematic to allow the proliferation of something like this and call it a religion because it portrays the idea that religions can just do whatever they want and call themselves whatever they want and still access all of the benefits.
We think insofar as the average person would not get away with crimes like this, we do not understand why an institution or an organization would.
Our third argument is about the improper use of money.
The money that the church makes doesn't go back into the community or even the facilities, rather it goes into the private pockets of many of its members and goes to funding political organization and lobbying.
They've literally invested in trying to infiltrate and influence the government.
If you're going to be a church and be excluded from taxes, you shouldn't be using money this way because it literally is you working against the groups that provided you with the support you needed in the first place.
They did they also did things more directly like supported some nebraskan senator-elect, someone else in california.
We shouldn't be mixing church and state in this way.
If we allowed this, then every political pac ever would claim they are a church to get their taxes removed so that they can use more of their money to their political ends.
Recognize that out of these three arguments, even if you buy one of them, then we already win this round because we show you that they are unsuitable to be a church.
Like we think that the criteria for being a religion has to be multifaceted and you have to hit all of them.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should legalize the growing of coca leaf.
So I think that the three main areas of clash: first on the difference between coca versus cocaine.
Recognize first that there isn't a right to ban.
Coca is a component of a drug, not the drug itself.
The government can ban the item if it itself is harmful, or if there's a pertinent government interest involved.
But the problem here is that there is that neither of these are met when you are banning the component.
Like coca leaves are not harmful to individuals or those who are external to them, and it also isn't actually pertinent government interest to ban the plant insofar as what the government is trying to criminalize is the drug itself.
There also doesn't exist a precedent in the status quo to ban coca.
You can't ban components of drugs in so far as things like the components of meth are not banned or the components of cocaine, which include battery acid, gasoline, cough syrup.
None of these are banned because we recognize that they serve utile like needs of society in other respects and thus ought not be banned.
Also, recognize that coca leaves are much less harmful even than other things like cigarettes.
Like, it has been judged as a much more light narcotic than tobacco and it's something that is closer to caffeine.
Which means the item itself is not harmful either, and as such it not ought be banned.
Our second area of clash is about government interest.
We think there's actually a pertinent government interest in not banning the coca leaf for two main reasons: first, economics.
Recognize that new markets are always good.
It means that you stop having to import the coca that is used to do things like create like chocolate, or anything else that uses coca, and it also means that you can start exporting your own to other countries that might need it.
Insofar as we have fairly like diversified and like intense technologies regarding like greenhouse growing and things like that.
It also means that new jobs are developed around this industry, which is always good insofar as this creates economic stimulus and allows individuals who previously could not support themselves to do so.
But the second reason there's a pertinent government interest is in terms of the regulations that can now be added.
It is infinitely easier to regulate and track production that in in our world, insofar as currently any grown coca is likely going directly to cocaine because it is all illegal and so the only reason you would risk being caught with it if you were making enough money to justify the fact that you were growing up in the first place.
Making it legal means it'll means that groups that like previously might have been growing it for cocaine or like already have the infrastructure to grow it and don't want to be involved in such a risky business, are much more likely to reallocate those resources and grow it legally.
But it also just means it's a lot easier to track if you have to keep a registry of how many coca farms there are everywhere, and so you can like track how much is going into the market versus how much like was produced, things like that.
Our third area of clash is about coca being a helpful product.
Recognize that there has been a lot of like light research done that has shown that coca can actually be really really helpful in terms of like aiding digestion, fixing altitude sickness, helping with fatigue, helping with weight loss, but there has never been any like real intense study into any of these fields, in part because it's been banned so it's too risky for scientist to spend time on it because they see like better to spend time elsewhere.
We think precluding this research is really really damning, insofar as it's probably good if we create a world in which we utilize our resources to the greatest extent and stop being limited by an arbitrary fear of this maybe being used to help with a drug that manages to make its way into our borders either way.
I think a major problem in this round is that is that criminalizing coca leaf doesn't actually prevent people from getting high off of cocaine or obtaining cocaine in other ways.
At the point that that's true you might as well not ban it at all.
Also, like chocolate production is probably good and it's something that is becoming more and more extinct recently and so like we think that stimulating that as well has a positive effect.
Proud to propose."
"We should legalize public nudity.
So I think it's important to establish a couple of definitions.
By public nudity we mean the ability for people to see the naked body in a public place.
Straightforward enough.
But we think it's important that this round is about non sexual nudity.
We're okay with preventing lewd behavior, but we don't think that there's inherently sexual about naked bodies in and of themselves so we think that they ought be permitted in public.
So, our first argument is about victimless crimes.
So first of all I think it's important to establish nobody even the smallest child is unaware of nudity.
Everyone sees their own body every day.
On top of that though we tell you that there is no harm to seeing another person naked.
I'd like to ask the other team to explain where this horror might arise.
We don't see how seeing a familiar sight, something that your entirely aware of, something that occurs in nature, something that isn't especially obscene, except for perhaps according to certain religious groups that not everyone is a part of, something that effectively shouldn't be offensive to anybody.
We think that just as in the status quo there's been a huge push to allow mothers to nurse in public because it's not sexual and it's not obscene and it's a normal part of life that everyone has participated in, we should allow nudity in the same way because, again.
, there are no harms and it's a perfectly normal part of life.
So the question then is why do we punish in the status quo?
The status quo is fundamentally moralizing and we don't think this is the role of the state.
Basically.
Right now, in countries that don't allow public nudity, like some parts of the US or europe, certain people have decided that because they don't want to see naked people in public, no one should be able to be naked in public.
Now this seems problematic because it makes a value judgment on behalf of everyone and that value judgment is that it's more important that some individuals can avoid the naked body than other people can choose to express themselves.
We think that in the same way that clothing choice is incredibly diverse and not very regulated and that's a huge expression of one's own public opinions so is nudity.
We don't see why you should limit someone's public expression, particularly when most countries protect freedom of expression but don't give people some sort of positive right not to see nudity.
It just seems like the enforcement of arbitrary moral standards on everyone.
Moral standards that are probably held by a minority in many countries at this point in time.
So our second argument then is about fair standards.
I think that it would be okay to legalize nudity if we could come up with general fair standards for when people were decent and not decent.
But I think that the the very idea of decency is arbitrary and I think that in order to win the debate the other side needs to explain to you a fair standard for decency.
So right now it's probably true that most countries have a majority view.
Perhaps most people in a country like france think that it's okay to be nude at the beach but not okay to be nude at the supermarket.
But we think that first of all that's arbitrary, why should the rules be different in one place where families go every day, like the beach, then another place where families go everyday, like the supermarket.
Maybe it would be nice if everybody wore a collared shirt to work every day, and maybe a workplace can require that, but we don't see that you should require a collared shirt in the supermarket if you don't require one everywhere.
This doesn't seem meaningfully different.
Yes, nudity might be a bit shocking, but it's only because we're not used to it.
It's not really that different than the distinction between a collared and collarless shirt.
So you're effectively enforcing the views of a majority on a minority arbitrarily.
And within society there's also likely to be a great deal of dissent about what is and isn't decent.
For instance, muslim citizens of france might prefer to see women cover their heads at all times.
We think that that's a perfectly legitimate individual choice but in the same way that some people might be offended by seeing or even though some people might be offended by a single woman with her head uncovered in the streets in a french city, some people are offended by seeing nudity in the streets of a french city.
Most french people would argue against a more restrictive standard, such as forcing women to keep their heads covered, we in the same way favor a less restrictive standard by allowing people to choose to be nude if they want to do so.
Ultimately we think that there's no clear line in the sand for when a standard of decency becomes fair, or becomes arbitrary, or when something becomes decent or indecent, so at that point we ought just defer to maximizing individual freedom by allowing public nudity.
So for these reasons, because it doesn't hurt anybody and because there's no fair way to regulate against it, we should legalize public nudity.
Thank you"
"We should ban extreme sports.
So, extreme sports is a pretty broad term, but generally we're talking about things like skydiving, bungee jumping, motor racing, things that are not standardized, so they don't have some sort of standardized performance and and metrics that govern how the sport is behaved, they're largely individualized, and they are most noteworthy because they have a much higher risk of not just injury itself, but once individuals are injured, it's much higher propensity of injuries that can be life threatening compared to other sports.
So this can be seen pretty clearly in that while bungee jumpers, for the most part, you know most bungee jumpers don't get hurt, when bungee jumpers do get hurt they can face life threatening injuries, whereas for example basketball players may get hurt at a similar clip as bungee jumpers, but there are very very few lethal injuries that can be accumulated from basketball.
Okay.
So what are we going to argue today.
Firstly what we're going to tell you is that these types of sports are, by their nature, incredibly dangerous compared to most other sports.
We think that the government's first and foremost obligation is to ensure that citizens are protected, and that their lives are not put at undue risk.
We understand that freedom freedom of behavior is an important part of accessing what one perceives as their good life, and that individuals, for the most part, should be able to make decisions that they see fit for their own bodies when those decisions don't otherwise have an adverse effect on society, which extreme sports seems to fit as those decisions that should be able to be freely made.
But we would say that before you can guarantee these types of freedoms that individual seek to have, you must first ensure that their liberty, or their bodily safety or their bodily health, can be protected and we think that extreme sports are those types of sports that don't allow this to be the case.
And furthermore, if you look at the demographics of those that watch extreme sports, and the growing interest in extreme sports, these are largely amongst young individuals that don't know about the amount of training and preparation, and the and cannot properly internalize the risks that extreme that extreme sports presents when they make the decision to do these types of things.
We think that these are largely impressionable people, and while individuals are en masse very very poor long-term planners, the people that are interested in extreme sports in the status quo are even worse than the average individual, because they're much younger and it's hard for them to visualize the actual and internalize the actual risk of extreme sports.
And we think in these instances, the government is justified in banning these types of activities, because it must first and foremost protect life before it can protect freedom.
Secondly, we would say that traditional sports have benefits that these sports don't have.
So for example, traditional sports can increase fitness, can increase team building and work ethic in individuals, but these types of benefits are not are are not a part of extreme sports just because of the nature of these sports.
They're not team based, you don't necessarily need to train for long periods of time to be you don't need to train your body for long periods of time to do these things, so they don't increase your physical fitness to the same degree of other sports, and again, the the danger of them is so much higher, the degree of risk is so much higher in these sports, that the only real benefit that can come from these things is an adrenaline rush that people feel in the moment.
We think that this means that fundamentally there are no real gains that can be derived from extreme sports that other sports have going for them, and what we what this means is that when you're weighing whether or not the government should act in this instance, there's very little to weigh in favor of these extreme sports besides the freedom to be able to do what you want.
But as I've already explained, this freedom is not cannot fundamentally override the government's obligation to protect life first and foremost.
Because extreme sports present an undue threat to that life with very little gain at the end of the day for those that participate in them, we should ban extreme sports."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should subsidize condoms.
We being the united states government.
By subsidize, we think that we would make the the price of condoms very low, IK like ten for a dollar in the majority of areas and make sure that condoms are provided for free at any publicly funded health clinic.
Two main areas of clash: the first on preventing unwanted pregnancies.
Recognize that people use using condoms means they're not getting pregnant, and this is oftentimes like the preferable state if there are people who are going to use condoms in the first place, right?
Like we think that people are going to have sex either way, because this is a biological drive that is very difficult to ignore, especially if you are systematically being prevented from accessing it.
So if you are someone who like actively just never has enough money to buy the pack of condoms then but your desire for sex still exists, it's likely that you're going to play the probability game, because you have nothing to lose in that regard, but also because people are kind of dumb when it comes to sex, and they just kind of have it because they have drives to do so.
But we don't want unwanted children to exist, because oftentimes these are the ones who are most likely to be maltreated or most likely to not be like fully acquired by the system well.
But also we think that the woman's life matters a lot.
We think that you ought be prioritizing a woman's future above this like tiny batch of cells that doesn't even exist yet, when we're like providing condoms.
And so we think that given that there's like a non-zero probability that this woman is going to have sex and that it is without a condom, she will get pregnant, we think that it is important to then facilitate her existence and facilitate her future being able to continue.
We think this is especially important when it comes to underage girls and boys insofar as this to be the largest population that doesn't have the money or access to stores with condoms, but also have the greatest desire to have sex a lot of the time.
We think that this is also the situation in which their life really gets screwed.
Like getting pregnant in high school is something that derails your entire future in ways that could never be predicted otherwise.
Society doesn't treat single mothers and fathers very well.
Often, it means that they don't get the same opportunities that people who did not have children early get.
So, this like might be like job opportunities with regards to people portraying single parents as those who have less time to devote to jobs or whether it's like educational opportunities, it's really difficult to attend college classes if you are also a child, and so we think this is really like bad.
But also, we think that sex is like fundamentally important to individual fulfillment, right?
Like we think that at the point that it's going to come at relatively little cost to the government to subsidize this kind of production and would also be beneficial to the economy insofar as it's like is a production that would occur, then we think that it's actually like fine to facilitate like basic human need and basic human desire in such a way.
Our second area of clash is about the government, like the pertinent government interest in the situation.
Because recognize that unwanted children and single parents oftentimes end up relying on the government systems a lot more.
So doing things like needing public housing or welfare or food stamps oftentimes happens to individuals who like oftentimes disproportionately impacts individuals who have had an unwanted pregnancy.
It also they also end up not being able to function in society as efficiently as they probably could, like, for example, not being able to go to college or get the job they would prefer because they're tied down by the child that they now have.
And the problem is that we like prefer a world in which people get to be as efficient as possible, right?
Like we think it's good when people who are passionate about certain subjects get to explore those passions, because I'm probably going to do a better job of doing what I'm passionate at.
We also think there's an important argument here about how this circumvents the republican like rudeness when it comes to birth control.
Like they don't like abortions, but now less people are going to need them, because the government is subsidizing condoms.
We think it's a bipartisan win-win and anyone who disagrees with it is like actively a problem, right?
Like we think you should just subsidize condoms.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"We should protect endangered species.
First, because species interact with one another, and he extinction of a species can cause widespread ramifications on food chains, and widespread bad impacts.
And secondarily, because I think that there's an inherent value in life, and an inherent value in bio diversity, that we should ultimately just have a moral duty to protect.
So, let's first talk about the practical harms that extinction actually has.
I think that, it's quite obvious that food chains are very much interconnected with one another.
So, the obvious example of this is that, you have like grass that gets energy from the sun, then you have animals that eat grass, and then you can have humans that can eat either those animals or that grass, things like that.
And that's like a very basic illustration of the way in which life is interconnected, and if one of those things is absent, IE if if an animal goes extinct, then that means that, all the good that it does, so for example maybe , it spreads the seeds of an animal, or maybe it is food for another animal, or it prevents overpopulation of other kind of animal or plant, their nature has a natural way of insuring checks and balances, and insuring its own stability in an ecosystem.
So, when we don't protect endangered species, we make it so that lot of these species are going to die out and mess up the food chain entirely.
So, what is a really concrete example of what this looks like, and how it can harm a lot of people a lot of actors, including people?
A lot of in recent times, because of like genetical engineering and things like that, we've seen a lot of like honey bees become more and more extinct, except in more farming context, as opposed to like killer bees, which are becoming much more widespread.
And this presents a problem, because they do much less in the way of pollination, like pollinating different flowers.
So, this means that flowers are less likely to spread, it also means that it's harder for fruits to grow, things like that.
And that means that, anything that uses the flowers, or anything that eats the fruit, their source of food is compromised, and that means that the extinctions can become compounded, and it can lead to more problems.
So, that's that's that's very bad, and that can lead to catastrophic problems in some cases.
But, the second thing that I want to talk about is about the ethical duty to protect endangered species.
So first, I want to talk about fault, because I think that by and large, a lot of the reasons why I think species are endangered, is because of humans in the first place.
We're in the midst of a mass extinction of a lot of organisms, and it's obvious that humans are the culprit .
Whether it's by habitat destruction, over fishing, or over eating, or over consuming, or pollution, there's a whole variety of ways in which humans are compromising the environment, and making it more difficult for a lot of organisms survive in them.
And that's really important, because the endangerment is the fault of humans.
So if that endangerment is a problem, then it's something that we have a moral duty to correct.
And, I think that this is a problem, because I think that there's an inherent value in life, and there's an inherent beauty in life, whether it's the smallest bug, or like the largest like I don't know hippopotamus, or elephant, or things like that, a lot of elephants get like in danger for like their tusks, ivory and things like that.
I think that in a lot of ways these are these are animals that have complex lives, and complex emotions in a lot of cases, they can be animals that could have depression, they could be animals that have families, they can be animals that, in a lot of ways, can suffer and have pain.
I think that there's a whole lot of beauty, and a whole lot of value, to the lives that they hold, and I think that when we put them in bad situations, we're really doing a moral harm to them, and that's something that we should stop.
So, for all those reasons, we should protect endangered species."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should abolish the social security tax.
Models pretty straightforward.
We would just get rid of the social security system in general.
I think we would faze this out.
Obviously we wouldn't do it all overnight.
So basically we would slowly decrease the tax and decrease the payouts until the system just sort of weaned off.
So three independent points.
First, the system is regressive.
Right now payouts are tied to the previous income that you had over the course of your life.
It's like you're average income or something like that.
That's a problem because even in theory, that just means that people will get back what they paid into it.
That basically rich people who had high incomes were taxed more and they get a bigger payout.
But the problem is that the trajectory of this country over the last couple decades really has been widening inequality.
That means that in practice, people pay the amount that they made over time but that gap over time widens.
So what really happens then is that the money from poorer individuals trickles up into the richer individuals who get bigger cash outs later in their lives.
Basically you were paying tax rates that were closer to each other at the beginning so in the comparative poor people were shouldering a larger part of the burden then they wound up getting out again in the comparative at the end of the cycle.
That's a problem and it's fundamentally opposed to what the purpose of a tax system should be, especially one that is designed to support people who don't have a means of supporting themselves.
Our second independent point is that the system is unsustainable and as a result doesn't meaningfully solve for the lack of older people to actually support themselves financially.
Population growth over time means that there's never enough money in the system.
Basically a group of young people is paying into the or rather sorry not population growth like boom and bust cycles so like a large amount of baby boomers and things like that following the smaller population sizes, means that there is irregularity.
So that means that generally speaking, you're going to have time periods when there is a large amount of people trying to withdraw from the system and not a lot of people paying into it.
That leads to insolvency and that's a serious problem for your ability to actually have a fiscally responsible government system that is capable of giving people money when they need it.
Our third independent point, and this is what I think is the most important, is that it actively harms economic growth.
So recognize that the comparative to a social security system is one wherein people plan for their own retirement, so they take that money and they invest it into something where the value of that money increases.
Here's the problem, right now that money just goes into tax offers.
It doesn't invest into anything.
Doesn't really grow in any meaningful sense.
It just stays there and then it gets put to somebody else.
So this is economically inefficient for two reasons.
First is that the comparative again is like investment in things that actually grow your wealth and grow the economy at large because there's like more activity going on so multiplier effects things like.
But secondly, you don't account for inflation when it's just sitting in a coffer there.
Like when it's just like sitting in whatever social security office like the money is literally worth less when you pay it back out.
Like this is a just horribly inefficient system and just a ridiculous way of trying to allocate for people's retirements.
Like even if you buy that some people are just going to be bad at paying for their retirements, it makes so much more sense to let the people who actually are capable of planning for their retirements to invest the money, have those investments taxed, and use that money to pay for social welfare programs for the people that couldn't get retirement stuff together in the short term.
Like this is just the most ridiculous way of paying for people and actually ensuring a good quality of life for seniors and it just makes infinitely more sense to allow people to make their own decisions with their retirement funds and then tax those good decisions to pay for the people that made bad decisions.
Proud to propose."
"The motion for today's debate is that we shouldn't subsidize agriculture.
By this, by we, we mean the united states, and basically what this would look like is that we would end any programs that subsidize farmland, seeds, or any continual subsidies for being a farmer, such as like easier tax breaks and loans.
Two main areas of clash, the first on why the subsidies harm start-ups and poor farmers.
Even with subsidies, it is very expensive to start a farm, which means that anyone that is going to do so has to have a lot of capital at the beginning to take advantage of the subsidies in the first place.
And a lot of the subsidies only become accessible after you've started a farm or come in the form of loans which require you to have a good enough credit rating and are often a very tricky thing for people to be able to swallow or consider themselves capable of taking out.
What this means is that poor farmers or want-to-be farmers are actually harmed since they can't access the start-up capital or even if they do, do not get as much benefit from the subsidies in order to challenge previous existing corporate monopolies.
More than this, if they they have to now combat these richer corporate farms that have been benefiting from the subsidies for much longer and due to size, can benefit from more of them from more of them.
What this does is it often forces smaller farms out because they get much less access to the subsidies in the first place, whereas without the subsidies, corporations will show less interest in agriculture, and farming monopolies are less likely to occur.
It also gives more power to the consumer because without subsidies, choices to boycott or buy from someone else have much more of an impact.
Currently what happens is that large corporate farms that are less liked by consumers can continue to float through on profits, because the subsidies make it so that certain consumers leaving or choosing other brands does not affect them in a way that affects their like their profit line.
But in our world, when you don't have these subsidies, the decision to not buy from a corporation can actively harm their profits because the subsidies no longer exist, and it means a lot more when consumers en masse choose to buy from a more local or a smaller farmer.
Our second area of clash is why it harms developing countries in the global economy.
When the united states subsidizes agriculture, they make it much cheaper than what other countries can produce agricultural goods for.
This forces other countries to purchase produce from the united states, and this in itself has many bad impacts.
First, it creates underdevelopment personal agriculture sectors in these countries and a reliance on the US goods.
Because they're buying from the US, governments don't invest in their own country's farming because they don't have an incentive to.
It's cheaper for them to buy from the united states and so, they don't have to like invest in their own or like because it's actually in doesn't become financially feasible to invest in their own in this at the same time.
This long term ties them to the US because even if the price skyrockets, they wouldn't have the infrastructure to produce their own.
We think this is incredibly problematic because because we want these countries to be able to function independently of large western powers and because, in the end, we also want these countries to be spending more of their money investing in their own sectors, since these are the sectors that can actually grow and power their economy.
You don't get economic growth from continually importing your goods because this isn't these are supplied by people who are working in other countries, so you're not actually paying wages for those who are for your own citizens, and you're creating reliances that can often be incredibly unstable.
This brings us to our second harmful impact which is that it harms their economies of these nations.
Agriculture provides an economic boost and trade, and it is an incredibly stable economic impetus, because there's always a constant demand for food.
And oftentimes, individual countries with different climates can carve out niches for specific fruits.
So, what this means is that when you don't have a good agricultural sector, you're actually doing yourself an economic disservice.
It also means that when you have a long-term dependency on other countries, even if they have sudden shifts in the economy, you still have to move along with them, which is economically problematic.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"Compulsory voting is advantageous.
So basically, we think that other democratic countries should adopt an australian style model, where there is a fine for people who do not go out and vote.
We're fine with establishing something like a national holiday where everyone gets the day off work, and also facilitating things like absentee voting and voting by mail, so that it's easier for people to get their ballot in.
But we do think that there needs to be a real punishment for people who choose not to vote.
We're okay with blank ballots as well on our side of the house, we think what's important is that people go out to the polls.
So, with that in mind, we're going to explain to you why participation is good.
But first, I'd just like to explain why participation is going to go up.
The other team might get up here and tell you that basically, if you make people go out to vote who don't want to, that they're just going to turn in blank ballots, or that they're going to write mickey mouse on their ballot.
But I think that if you require people to vote, they'll be more likely to take their duties as a citizen seriously, and that many more people will turn in real ballots with a vote that reflect their own interest, because they'll have more of an incentive to inform themselves about the candidates and the issues.
So with that in mind, let's think about the impacts of this increased participation.
Right now in a lot of countries voter participation in midterm elections is like forty percent.
So you're looking at much much greater participation.
What does this do in society?
We think that it makes governments more accountable to citizens.
Right now, governments can conduct lots of unpopular policies that hurt ordinary working people, that are bad for families, that are bad for low income people, that are bad for particular communities, and they're never held accountable, because people from those groups don't vote.
If you had a district that had very low voter turnout and all the people who voted were white, even though it was majority black, then the government would have no incentive to treat black citizens of that district well, because they don't contribute to voting.
All politicians care about is getting reelected, they don't actually care about helping citizens.
Everyone who goes into politics wants to increase their own power.
They might think that they want to help people, but if they really wanted to do that, they'd probably be a doctor or something instead, we tell you that elected officials are really just following their own will to power.
At that point the only way to hold them accountable is to link popular will to power and make them accountable, and the best way to do that is to force everyone to go out and vote.
The second major impact of this is that it would lead to less discrimination in government.
Right now governments can do things like draw voter boundaries, such that they know that a group of people who is very likely to vote is in a district with a group of people who are very unlikely to vote, and this let's them discriminate against the latter group.
For instance, by putting one wealthy town in a district with a low income town, they might say well wealthy people are much more likely to vote, so now we can discriminate against those low income people.
And they plan this in advance, we call it gerrymandering in the united states, when they deliberately draw boundaries to facilitate discrimination against one group of people.
We think that will be more difficult if all of those people had to go vote, now there would be less of an incentive to gerrymander, you would get better voting districts and also less discrimination.
And our last argument is about democratic legitimacy, and I think this is especially important for developing democracies.
The legitimacy of a democracy is based on the idea that it represents the will of the people.
It's very difficult for a government to claim that they represent the will of the people, when only thirty or forty percent of the people actually go out and vote.
We think that with mandatory voting you can say look, everybody in the country came forward and they turned in a ballot, and we counted that, and then we got the outcome that we did and now we're moving forward.
We think people are much more likely to respect those outcomes rather than to say, oh that's bogus, most people didn't even vote.
So at the end of the day, we see this affects even highly developed countries like the US.
Many people say that oh, hillary clinton would have won if voter turnout had been higher, so the election's not legitimate, things like that.
But it's a much greater concern particularly in low income countries or developing countries, where you run the risk of anti-democratic parties or anti-democratic institutions rising up, and exploiting people who think that democracy doesn't matter because it's not fair anyway.
So because of these impacts, we think greater voter participation is a good thing, and therefore that compulsory voting is advantageous.
Thank you."
"We should further exploit green technology.
In this debate there's one thing that matters more than anything else and that is the impending damage that is going to be caused by global warming if we do not take drastic action in the immediate future.
So we think that's what we're going to talk about most in this debate but secondly, if you don't care at all about global warming, survival of the human race and all you care about is the economy, green technology happens to be quite good for the economy and job creation as well.
So we'll talk about that a little bit at the end.
Okay, on global warming predictions of the status quo use of fossil fuels in the status quo, energy consumption, is that the current pace of our societies users use of fossil fuel is going to cause multiple degrees of warming in the environment in the next one hundred years.
This is catastrophic.
It is hard to overstate how damaging global warming is going to be in the next century if we do not get our act together now.
So I'm going to lay out some of those impacts.
First, it's expected that ice caps are going to melt at a dramatic rate which leads to two big important impacts.
The first is sea level rise.
This is dramatically important because if the sea level starts to rise by ten or fifteen feet, there are some massive hubs of commerce and populations that are going to be underground.
For example, much of the coast of florida is expected to be underground before the end of this century.
The same can be said of harbor cities and these all happen to be centers of commerce.
Most countries develop on their coast which means that when sea levels rise, the first people that are going to be impacted, the most impacted areas, are also going to be the areas that happen to have the most the highest rate of people, the highest per capita rate of people.
So this is going to lead to immense needs to move populations, immense losses of property and value from that property.
That is going to have a massive impacts on the economy and on human life moving forward.
The other thing that ice caps melting is that it warms waters globally.
What this means is that you end up getting much more intense storms over a or during hurricane and tsunami seasons and times like this which means that you're going to have even harsher weather impacts to go hand in hand with the fact that people are going to have to flee from their homes because of the sea level rising in the future.
Finally, some other impacts of global warming if that wasn't bad enough.
You also have unpredictable weather patterns which can lead to drought in many areas and higher temperatures which can kill crops.
All this means that to go with the fact that huge population centers are going to be immensely at risk, you're also going to have a situation in which drought and famine are likely to take over causing war and other types of damage.
The impacts of global warming if unchecked will literally kill millions of people most of whom in the developing world, did not prosper from oil and other types of fossil fuel development.
We need to drastically decrease our fossil fuels output immediately in order to avoid that and green technology is the only way that we can hope to avoid these types of dramatic harms moving forward.
But even if you don't care about any of that, let's talk about business and why green technology is good.
Green technology is an entirely new sector of the economy to open up and with that brings thousands of new jobs and businesses into the economy and so being a green tech leader is something that actually helps bolster an economy and this is why small countries in europe such as such as a scandinavian country in sweden and the netherlands denmark, these are all countries that are trying to be leaders in green technology because it bolsters you're standing on the world stage and it creates new jobs that are high skilled jobs and mobile because unlike other types of drilling jobs in fossil fuel jobs these are dangerous jobs by any stretch and they don't require you to be in any one particular area which means they're mobile jobs that pay well and are not damaging and open up an entirely new sector of the economy that is only bound to get more efficient.
For all of these reasons, we should further exploit green technology."
"The right to self defense is absolute.
So by this we mean to say that in countries that constitutionally guarantee their citizens rights, we think that there should be no limitation on the right to self defense.
So three broad arguments to this.
The first is about facilitation of rights, the second is about the idea of proportional response, and the last is about where this right arises.
So with regards to facilitating other rights.
We think that it is necessary to defend one's own life in order to access any other right.
So whatever constitutional guarantees you may have, whether that be the right to vote, the right to be on a jury, the right to bear arms etcetera.
All of these depend on your own continued well being.
So we think that at that point, if any other right that you have is absolute, then your right to self defense must be as well in order to defend that right.
It's almost an extension of the other right that is absolute.
And we tell you that there is probably an absolute right to life in most countries.
No one is allowed to kill you, the state can't kill you in most countries.
So this is an absolute right.
And at that point we think it's therefore necessary, at least in those countries, that your right to self defense also be absolute in order to facilitate that other right.
Our second argument is about the types of limitations that we tend to see on one's right to self defense.
In many countries courts would like to see some idea of proportionate response when you respond to a threat against your own life.
So for instance, they wouldn't allow you to justify killing someone because somebody hit you, for instance, because you probably wouldn't have died from being hit again.
But it's impossible to know someone else's intentions.
If someone behaves in a violent or threatening way towards you, such that you fear for your own life, we think that that is legitimate and that you need to act upon it.
We think that people have a good sense of their own safety, and furthermore that no one else who was in that not in that situation can accurately gauge what it was like to be in that situation.
So at that point we think that we ought defer to allowing people to take whatever action they think is necessary when their own life is under threat.
And we already use a similar metric for separating different crimes in the status quo, such as intent for first and second degree murder in the united states.
So we think that at that point courts are already involved in the sort of thinking and ought apply it more broadly.
What's more.
When situations unfold quickly as they often do when violence is in play, we don't think that one can afford to sit back and think, hmm, can I disable this person in a non-lethal way, or can I respond with a lesser amount of force.
People act as quickly as they can and often don't have the ability to think through all of their options clearly.
Lastly we think that the idea of proportionality is probably arbitrary.
We don't see why one person hitting another should proportionately be responded to only by hitting if one is much stronger than the other person or something like that.
We just don't think that it's ever possible to be fair about this type of proportionality, we think it will always be arbitrary.
So our last argument is about why we think that this right arises from nature.
So consider that in the state of nature, so if we imagine way back to the dawn of time when people didn't live in states, everyone could defend themselves from others and this was seen as something that was acceptable.
The big divide between whether or not something is just or unjust seems to be whether it is responsive or aggressive.
So attacking another person in the state of nature is probably still wrong and that's one reason why people form states, but defending oneself is almost certainly not wrong.
And you can see this extended into the fact that every society around the world allows people to defend themselves from a hostile attack.
So we think that at that point this right ought be absolute, because it is a human universal that arises from nature that human beings are allowed to defend themselves from other human beings if their life is under threat, or if they feel unsafe in their person.
Now look, we're not defending people abusing this right, like we saw with the trayvon martin case in florida a few years back, but we think that it's entirely possible for courts to arbitrate which instances of self defense are legitimate and which are not, and then to decide that in legitimate cases the right to self defense is absolute.
So for these reasons we think that that right ought be considered fundamentally absolute.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should ban school uniforms.
Three main areas of clash, first on allowing children to self identify.
Clothing is an important part of an individual self identity because it allows individuals to project to the rest of the world who they are and what they want to be perceived about them.
The problem with uniforms is that when every single individual looks the same there's no way for those who want to stand out to stand out, or those who want to be like to blend in particularly as compared to others to identify with any specific group.
Everybody looks exactly the same.
It forces individuals into uniformity.
It's especially important for children who are still figuring out who they are and have a like large amount of their rights already restricted, especially in the school system.
Like they're not allowed to say certain things, they're not allowed to protest in certain ways, obscenities are banned.
Like things that we see is fundamental to our right to free speech and our right to expression is always barred from children.
So we think that the ways in which they can express themselves ought be protected and shouldn't be regulated by things like uniforms.
So that's actually really important.
But also, recognize that giving kids as much freedom as possible allows them to learn how they relate to the world.
Like kids already get screwed in terms of every other kind of right.
They don't have a freedom of mobility, they don't get to vote, and we we don't think that this should be additional limitation insofar as it is unnecessary and doesn't serve any kind of pragmatic purpose.
Our second area of clash is about sexist enforcement.
Recognize that school uniforms, the majority of the time, require girls to wear skirts.
The problem for anyone who doesn't feel comfortable with girly clothing is that like now they are like perpetually being forced into this kind of cage and into this kind of identity.
Whether it's because you're a tomboy or because you're trans, uniforms force you to be in be and present yourself in a certain way and in a certain aesthetic that isn't similarly enforced onto men.
Like even if we had uniforms that like allowed pants for women, they would always be tighter and like the like the tops would always be different.
And like and we think the problem there is that like this fundamentally disadvantages women.
Because recognize that even for boys who might care about how they dress, this is always a less restrictive.
Like at least like a lot of the time primary to high school boys usually care less anyway, but also their their clothing is just a lot less specific.
It's like less likely to be tight things like that.
So we actually think that it's really important that these kinds of things don't get enforced because it's always in a lot of ways sexist.
Our third area of clash is about the cost of uniforms.
Recognize that a lot of the schools that do this are in much richer areas because it's seen as this like preppy thing to do or like it's like seen as classy or whatever.
And so like inner city schools don't care about uniforms.
They don't have the resources to care about them, they don't have the energy to care about them.
So it's usually schools in like richer areas with a higher income population.
So these uniforms tend to be costly and required to be bought over and over as the child grows.
Meanwhile for poorer students when uniforms aren't required clothing can be bought back from thrift stores for very cheap, clothing can be baggy, that kids grow into, while with uniform you get in trouble for poor fit.
And so we like prefer parents to be able to choose what to buy, not be forced to budget for uniforms.
Especially since schools with uniforms tend to be more expensive, which gets reflected in that uniform costs.
And children who maybe can't afford as many or can't wash them as often are going are like much more likely to get picked on, because when everybody looks the same you stick out a lot more even if you look a little bit different.
We think that's actually quite important.
Proud to propose."
"We should subsidize student loans.
So by student loans we mean low interest rate loans made available for higher education and loans which don't accrue interest during the time a person is in school.
This how most americans go to college right now.
They take out subsidized loans from the government which have artificially low interest rates, let's say three percent at a time when the market is five or six percent, and the government pays the interest on these loans during the time that a person is a full time student.
So right now I'm a full time student the interest on my loans is being paid by the US government.
Thanks uncle sam.
We have a few reasons why we should subsidize student loans in the future.
The first is about access to education.
Very few people actually have enough capital to pay for an american university up front.
While it's true that in some countries like germany, university is very affordable, maybe a few hundred euros a semester.
In the US oftentimes the cost of attendance could be fifty or sixty thousand dollars.
Even very cheap US universities still tend to run to the tune of twenty or thirty thousand dollars.
A lot of people just don't have this kind of capital up front.
So even people who could afford to pay off this cost in the long term, wouldn't be able to go to college if they weren't able to borrow money from somewhere.
But borrowing at unsubsidized rates presents a huge burden to students because not only are they borrowing thousands of dollars but also they're accruing huge amounts of interest while they're in school and can't possibly pay them back.
This traps people in a cycle where they're just paying off the interest for years and years and years before they even begin to touch the principal.
So if you want to increase access to education for most people especially in the US you need to subsidize student loans so that they don't harm people while they're in school.
Our second argument is that fewer people will default if student loans are subsidized.
This seems [trivally/trivially} true but it's important for a few reasons.
So the reason why this is true is that if the loans are subsidized, interest rates are lower, that more people will be able to afford to pay them off and therefore you won't have defaults.
Defaults are really serious because they ruin someone's ability to be a productive member of society.
If a person defaults on their student loans that they won't be able to buy a house, or buy a car, or do a lot of other things that would help to grow the economy.
Most of the things that adult americans do nowadays rely on having a good credit score and destroying people's credit scores because of these defaults would ultimately harm them in the long term.
In many cases the government would lose out in fact because if someone were to default on their student loans, which is very difficult in the US but not in other countries, then the state would presumably lose out on all the money that they guaranteed in the first place.
So on our side we have fewer defaults and that's better both for the borrower and the lender in the long term and it's more than worth the small cost of the subsidy.
And our final argument is that this encourages people to go back to school later in life.
Plenty of people don't go to school when they're eighteen or nineteen, instead they go back when they're thirty or forty in order to change their career.
On our side we think that people are much more likely to do this when they're able to borrow money relatively easily.
If it were very expensive to borrow, then that would disincentivize people from going back to get an education.
Because more educated people tend to make more money and because people who change their careers tend to be happier after they've changed their careers, we think that it would be better both from a tax receipt purpose and also from the perspective of the individuals to encourage more people to go back and change their careers if they're not happy right now and we do that on our side by making retraining more accessible.
So for all of these reasons, we should subsidize student loans.
Thank you."
"I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should ban flag burning.
On the model, we will institute a fine for flag burning.
We're not gonna be ridiculous and like jail people for putting the flag on fire, but we will institute, you know, like a meager fine, maybe like a hundred dollars max.
Two independent points: first is that flag burning is disrespectful.
So, this is a pretty important symbol, not just to the nation but also to the people that live within this nation.
I think, you know, a lot of public polling can probably back me up on this.
This is just like a thing that people really, really care about.
There's a lot of songs about it too.
I think that's probably a good metric.
And it's important then to recognize that when a symbol is that important to such a large number of people, I think the government does have a positive obligation to protect that symbol.
That is, this is something people care deeply about in the way that they care about like actual policies or, you know, their personal like impact on to them personally.
And if this is something that people hold dear to them, and they do you think that this actually does have a significant amount of significance, then it is reasonable for the government to take active steps to protect it.
I think the reason why this is true is that, you know, the same reason why we consider other things to be worth protecting, that is, I really care about my physical health like, you know, like getting healthcare and things like that.
So that enables the government to take a positive step and a positive obligation to protect that thing.
In the same way if I am personally affected by flag burning, which a lot of people are, the government does have an obligation to ensure that that actual symbol is protected.
Our second independent point is that flag burning is extremely incendiary.
So, opp is going to get up here and talk to you about free speech and essentially claim that flag burning constitutes speech and therefore we have a positive obligation to protect it.
I think the problem, though, is that we don't have infinite free speech in this country.
Like the way that free speech is a right works is that there are limits on it, and the most, you know, commonly cited limit on it is the , you know, physical danger limit.
That is, shouting fire in a crowded theater, for example, is not, you know, allowed because that causes physical harm to other people and puts their lives in danger.
Likewise, I think that flag burning creates a significant amount of physical danger because of how incendiary it is.
That is, it is essentially comparable to, you know, starting a conflict that it is almost inevitable that someone will be so deeply offended by this action that they will want to engage in, you know, some sort of direct conflict with another person.
This has often started riots.
This has often started brawls.
I don't think that, you know, that's going to suddenly go away in the long term.
So I think at that point then, it is reasonable to restrict this form of speech insofar it is is essentially akin to shouting fire in a crowded theater.
It is something that, even if it itself is not an act of violence, is so incredibly likely to cause harm to other individuals through the direct action itself that it should be criminalized.
Generally speaking, the standard for free speech then probably shouldn't follow through.
, you know, opp will still tell you that there are individual benefits to, you know, free speech.
I don't think that these outweigh physical safety.
And the reason for that is that free speech is just a proxy for things that we want to happen to us, that the only reason I care about my ability to speak freely on any individual issue is one: because it's key to my autonomy in some regards, but secondly: because it's a proxy for ensuring that people understand my preferences and that therefore they can enact those preferences into law.
I think the problem with that, though, is that if people's physical safety are is endangered, that's obviously significantly worse.
You can't have your preferences, you know, enacted into law or for that matter even care that they're being enacted into law if, you know, your life is in danger, if you were dead, for example.
So, I think the physical safety then is always going to take precedent.
Proud to propose."
"We should ban targeted killing.
So we're gonna say we're gonna ban this in all instances, but we think it's important for the purpose of this debate to clarify that in the status quo most targeted killing is done in order to go after terrorism and to go after terrorists.
This is both for domestic and foreign terrorists.
We think obviously that in both instances it's bad to have targeted killings.
So that's primarily the parameters around we're around the debate we're having right now, we're mostly going to talk about terrorism, but to be clear, where against targeted killing in any capacity.
Alright, so we have two main arguments in this round: the first is that targeted killings are demonstrably unjust, and the second is that they're counterproductive in stopping terrorist activities and they are in fact more harmful than they do good.
Alright so how are they unjust?
We think that trials don't just exist in order to give some sort of veneer of legitimacy, but to actually uncover truth.
To give an idea of what has actually occurred.
To do a truth digging investigation.
And to ensure that people have the opportunity to defend themselves.
To ensure that all people are given the chance to mount a defense.
To give reasons for why they did their certain actions and to get some sort of mitigating circumstances on the record, and to ensure that all the truth has been uncovered.
Not all situations are those like osama bin laden, in which we know for a fact that he was responsible for certain attacks.
Many involved incredibly sketchy information.
Information that's coming from third or fourth parties, and you never get the defendant a chance to have you never give the defendant a chance to actually defend himself.
To ensure that he has an opportunity to state what his side of the story is.
The state and state actors often have motivations that need to be checked by the judiciary.
For example, eliminating political rivals, appealing to xenophobia, and creating a straw man poster for your followers.
These are things that people do in politics all the time, and we think that targeted killing is being able to go out and say: "" I killed this terrorist and I showed my strength and I sent a message to the terrorist organization "".
It's something that people are willing to do.
And they're willing to do these things on limited information, and they do these things in instances where civilians are often hurt.
All of these things undermined the justice that is done by targeted killing.
Because recognize to pass judgment and punishment in one swoop is not justice.
Its revenge.
It's an attack.
It's an act of aggression.
But it is not justice which is the veneer which with which leaders paint this act in order to justify it.
Given that their own justifications don't meet the criteria that they set out for themselves, we think the targeted killing is clearly unjust.
Okay so why is it also counterproductive?
These strikes almost always end up killing civilians.
A drone strike is not targeted enough to kill one individual, but it kills those around you.
And this is obviously unjust and bad.
These civilians didn't do anything to deserve that.
They were often just born in the village where this person happened to be hiding or they happen to know this person through some sort of second party.
Even if you believe that the target is guilty and deserves to die, we don't think that there's any justification for harming those around him.
And this is also optically horrible.
Especially when done on foreign ground.
It shows the state as a thug who enacts justice as it sees fit and it builds more propaganda for terrorist organizations, to point to people and say: "" look at this horrible behemoth in the west.
Look at what it does to target our people.
Look at how much it hates us.
So much so that it would attack your own people, civilians.
In order to get one terrorist actor out of there. ""
We think that this sends a bad message and and in the long run leads to more people being recruited into joining terrorist organizations, makes them more powerful in the long run not less powerful.
And on top of that all, as we've explained, these killings themselves are unjust.
For these reasons we should ban targeted killing."
"Prenatal diagnosis brings more good than harm.
What prenatal diagnosis allows individuals to do with their caregivers, with their doctors is to see what what is happening with the fetus.
So this means being able to screen not just the gender of the child but also to screen for genetic defects, for different illnesses that may arise during pregnancy, to get a better understanding of the health of the child.
In this regard, we think that prenatal diagnosis does demonstrably more good than harm.
So firstly, we're gonna talk about preparedness for parents and why that's so crucial, and secondly, whe're gonna talk about why information is always a net good.
So firstly, on preparation.
We think that there are two instances in which this can help avoid a tremendous amount of pain and difficulty both for parents and possibly for children.
Firstly, in instances when children have rare genetic disorders that them to be stillborn or cause them to be terminally ill immediately after birth, we think that this gives the option for women to know that information in advance and to make a decision about whether or not she wants to choose to carry that child to birth or to term.
Now we think that that choice is entirely legitimate to make, but we think that oftentimes women we think that oftentimes when children are born and are born terminal, are born stillborn, are are not able to live past their birth, we think that this is incredibly scarring for women to put your body through nine months of intense labor, pain and hardship, only to have this child that you have already grown attached to die in your own arms.
We think this is a tremendous psychological and emotional harm that happens to women and to and to fathers.
And we think that parents should be able to avoid this hardship.
In instances in which children are going to be stillborn, are not going to be able to live because of their genetic illnesses what have you, we don't think that parents should be forced to carry those children to term and only deal with the consequences.
Now in the vast majority of instances this isn't the case though.
In the vast majority of instances in which genetic illnesses or defects are detected, children are not going to die after birth, and we think those are the instances that are most important.
Cause we think that, information can only allow parents to make better decisions for their children.
Recognize that a child that is that's born with a genetic disorder, is going to face special challenges in their life.
They're going to need special assistance to make sure that they can be as successful as possible.
They need to get different educational care they need different early childhood care and different attention, different and parents simply don't know all this information.
The average person doesn't know what is required to take care of a child with down syndrome or a child with autism.
And given that this is the case, we think that when you allow parents to have this information ahead of time, they're going to be able to do research on this on this they're going to be able to make preparations whether they need to do certain things to their house to make it safe, whether or not they need to find certain doctors ahead of time to make sure that their child will be born and will be healthy and safe moving forward, all these things are considerations that the average parent won't need to won't need to deal with, but which is crucial for a parent that is having a child that has some sort of illness that needs to be dealt with.
We think that it's good both for the parents and for the child to know this information ahead of time, because planning allows for a smooth start to life for that child immediately, it doesn't mean that there needs to be some sort of in between time in which the child is not receiving the care that it needs, and secondly, it allows parents to mentally prepare for the difference between raising for the differences that they will face and the challenges, the unique challenges they will face in raising a child that has special needs.
We think that this isn't a challenge that can't be overcome, we think hundreds and thousands of brave parents and really good parents do this all the time, but without that mental preparation it become so much more difficult to deal with what you need to do moving forward, and giving that mental preparation and information is crucial in both instances in which it may be needed.
And because of that, we think prenatal diagnosis brings more good than harm."
"We should disband amnesty international.
By this we mean that britain or the organization as headquartered and other countries as well should remove their charter as a charity and stop allowing donations to the group.
We have a few reasons why we would disband amnesty international.
The first is that we think that if you care about helping the type of people that amnesty international claims to want to help, such as refugees or victims of state violence, that the group actually makes everything worse by the advocacy that they take.
The reason why is that there's a finite amount of political will for helping people who are the victims of these types of crimes.
In other words, there's a certain amount of people in countries like britain who really care about helping international victims of torture and similar abuses.
But when you have a group like amnesty international which has never achieved anything, more on that in just a moment, we think that these people pour all of their energy into a way to create change that will never work and can never work, and therefore that that energy isn't diverted towards getting britain's government to actually do something about these problems.
The reason why amnesty international will never be successful is that no abusive government cares about what some western charity says.
Right?
If I am apartheid south africa, let's say, I don't really care if amnesty international is mad at me.
I only care if british and american businesses are still willing to do business and have trade with me.
So there's no real mechanism for amnesty international to create change other than to beg companies and governments to do something.
And ultimately, at that point, people should be focusing directly on those issues rather than having this huge bureaucratic charity do it for them, which I'll return to in just a moment.
Our second argument is that amnesty international promotes ill will between countries.
Realize that people correctly perceive amnesty international as promoting western norms and interest at the expense of every other country's ideals.
Amnesty international doesn't spend all of their effort trying to get the US to end the death penalty or police brutality, for instance, even though that's a really serious problem.
They spend it trying to get brown dictators to stop torturing their people.
Ultimately, there's a lot of double standards, and we think that people really resent having a british charity come in and tell them how to run their country.
For instance, we think that especially in former colonies, people see this as a way for a former colonial power to mess with their government and try to impose their own moral norms.
At the end of the day, western countries do many things that are reprehensible, oftentimes invading other countries and harming many more people than these dictators ever do.
So we think that the fact that amnesty international focuses only on a certain type of country is really both racist and otherizing and problematic.
Moreover, we think that countries are likely to resent britain because they resent amnesty international and that if britain is to be a force for good in the world, they need to distance themselves from these meddling citizens who hurt their reputation globally.
And our final argument is that we think amnesty international is a bad charity.
So even if the other team thinks government shouldn't care about political will or the ill will that's created by this group, they should care about regulating charities.
Amnesty international has lots of highly paid execs and a huge bloated bureaucracy.
So it's not a very efficient charity, and we think that people are being misled as to what they're donating to.
It's not as though every dollar goes to fighting slavery in sub-saharan africa as amnesty international would have you believe.
In fact, a significant amount of the money goes to paying for british bureaucrats to live in nice flats in london and drive jaguars.
So we just think that this is a bad charity and that the government has a clear interest in shutting down bad charities so that good ones are able to succeed.
We think that charities where the money goes farther and more of the money goes to helping people, like nothing but nets, should be aided essentially by closing down bad charities like amnesty international.
For all these reasons, we should disband amnesty international.
Thank you."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should legalize doping in sports.
Just to make this a clear debate, we're going to model this in a professional level.
We're not talking about high schoolers taking steroids but rather about athletes who are competing on the college and olympic, etcetera, beyond that level.
So, three main areas of clash, the first on why this is non-unique from other current methods by which athletes maintain their bodies and make themselves more effective at their sport.
The major concern that people bring up when they talk about why we shouldn't legalize doping is that because it's not natural, because this cannot be met by means of the person's body alone, we ought not allow it to happen because it interferes with some imagined integrity of the sport.
The problem with this is that athletes already manipulate their bodies in massively unnatural, but legal, ways to win their activities.
They do things like putting themselves through strenuous diets and massive amounts of nutritional supplements.
They oxygen-deprive themselves while sleeping or exercising.
Not only are these things unnatural, but they are also often more dangerous than taking steroid-like substances or other doping substances.
More than this though, we think that at the point that they can be more dangerous, but also sports is inherently dangerous to the body, see when these athletes are done by the age as young as twenty-five to thirty, they cannot move, often suffer from massive amounts of arthritis and have to get treatments for things like their joint disorders, we think what this means is that you're not actually protecting athletes when you aren't allowing them to dope.
You're just making them find more extreme but still legal ways in which they might.
Our second area of clash has to do with why we think this levels the playing field.
We think the problem with anti-doping legislation is that it only destroys some careers.
It only finds a few people who are actually doping.
The problem with this is that massive amounts of athletes do dope but get under the radar.
And as long as there is a massive reward and of relatively little risk, and they can play the weighing game in their mind and decide that the outcome will be worth it if they don't get caught, they will continue to dope.
We think that you shouldn't enforce something that is effectively unenforceable equally.
But more than this, we think that when you make something legal, you make regulation easier, and you will actually be able to weed out the harmful stuff.
When you tell athletes what you need to succeed is going to be legal, we're just making sure that you don't cause yourself a heart attack, the weighing game becomes simpler.
It's no longer worth it to take that very dangerous drug, because there are other drugs that are available for cheaper and more legal means.
We think this is incredibly important in allowing athletes to make smarter choices for themselves as well and regulating actually harmful drugs.
Third, though, we want to spend a little bit of time talking about the spirit of the activity and what professional athleticism actually are.
We think a viable comparison is one in which we imagine a athlete as a race car driver and the body as their machine.
In the same one the same way that in formula one, they're constantly finding new ways to make themselves, their machines, better and stronger and updating with new technology, and this isn't considered illegal because you're just making your machine better, we think athletics are the same way.
At the point that the goal is to become the best human body, become the best at your your given sport, we don't think the line gets to be drawn at things that are deemed unnatural because of their chemical nature.
We think that in all reality, it's actually better in sports when you get to dope, because you're actually getting to access the the like highest of human possibility, and you're seeing what is truly surreal.
We don't think that people watch sports in order to see men like themselves or women like themselves compete.
They watch sports because they want to see powerful people doing what what they themselves could never do.
We think at the point that this happens anyway in much more dangerous ways now and they cannot solve it, just legalize doping.
For these reasons, proud to propose."
"The right of asylum is not absolute.
So by the right of asylum we mean the right of refugees to be taken in by a country to be given legal protections and cared for and aided by that country indefinitely until they're eventually able to return home.
So what we mean by not absolute is we think that it's perfectly legitimate for countries to set time limits on how long they're willing to keep refugees in their country and also for them to require that you go to the nearest safe soil when you seek refuge.
For instance, that people go to the nearest safe country.
So turkey from syria, rather than germany from syria.
Obviously we're okay with groups like the EU moving people around internally within the union in order to meet their own needs, but we do think that people should be going to the first country that they can arrive at that's safe, rather than going to a more economically developed country, like people who are trying to get to germany from eastern europe.
With this in mind we have two main arguments for you.
The first is about the nature of this right.
Recognize that the right to asylum is not a natural right that people have.
We can see that this is true because if you imagine a state of nature obviously there would be no right to asylum because there would be no states.
We can see therefore that the right to asylum is tied up in the existence and operations of governments.
We think therefore that this must be a right by convention.
What I mean by that is that people have come together and agreed, in this case explicitly through international agreements, that asylum seekers deserve certain privileges and considerations.
In other words this right is limited by the convention.
It's not something that's given to you by god or that you're born with, like human dignity.
So we tell you therefore that this right relies on the good will of host countries.
Therefore we need to preserve public support in order to maintain this right.
If you give people who are asylum seekers right now too generous a treatment and it creates a backlash among the public, then you jeopardize all future asylum seekers because people won't want to take them because they resent the ones they have right now.
But on top of that we tell you that people will vote to remove this right and no one will benefit from it in the future if it is taken advantage of too much.
So our second argument related to that is that the burden on developed nations is too high from asylum seekers right now.
Realize that people who come as refugees come into a country and they take resources away without contributing anything.
These people don't work, maybe eventually they'll be given work permits, but initially the idea is that they're temporary and they probably live in things like displaced people's camps, so they don't work and they cost lots and lots of money.
Now obviously we want to put a high value on people's lives and take care of them when we can, but this is a tremendous expense for the public.
We think that because money is fungible, that ultimately this is money that isn't going to spending on citizens.
You are directly having a trade off with things like healthcare and education, when you spend money on refugees.
We think therefore that there are harms, first of all, to legitimate asylum seekers when people come in who could've stayed somewhere else.
Because there's a trade off in funding and also harms to citizens who are needy because there's a trade off in funding.
We think that in particular many people are gaming the system to get access to wealthier countries.
There are lots of people fleeing syria who could have gone to turkey or lebanon or jordan, but who chose instead to go to germany or who have tried to come to other countries as well.
So these people are effectively just trying to get the most money they can for themselves out of the system rather than just seeking to be in a safe place which is what asylum and refugee status was ultimately established for.
So as a result of this burden on taxpayers, this trade off with legitimate refugees and this sort of self seeking entity, we think that ultimately it's acceptable to limit the right of asylum.
So for these two reasons, because of the burden on developed nations and because the right is by convention, we think that this right to asylum is not absolute.
Thank you."
"We should ban lotteries.
So in this debate we're talking about the types of public lotteries that are common in the US where every state runs a lottery and also private lotteries that are legal in other countries where a private institution sells tickets to that lottery.
With this in mind three arguments for our side.
The first is that lotteries amount to a tax on those who are least able to pay taxes.
What do we mean by this?
The people who are most likely to buy lottery tickets and participate in this very low buy-in form of gambling, because often lottery tickets cost one dollar or pound or euro, are those who are very low income.
Many times convenience stores and things like that in low income neighborhoods have huge displays of lottery tickets that are tremendously tremendously popular with the people who live in those communities.
So these people are basically throwing away good money after bad buying lottery tickets when they could be spending it on things that would actually better their life.
I'm not telling you that we know better than those people how they ought to spend their money, but what I am saying is that in particular, when lotteries are used as a source of fundraising for the state, it seems immoral to fundraise from those who are least able to lose out on this money.
We think that people in these low income communities are probably less educated about how unlikely they are to win the lottery and ultimately are being scammed, in some cases, by their local government.
We think that we should ban lotteries because they take advantage of low income, largely less educated people who aren't able to assess the risks as well as someone who has the benefits of higher education and things like that.
Our second argument is that lotteries are abusive to gamblers.
It's relatively easy if you have a gambling addiction to do things like avoid gambling websites or casinos.
You can just choose not to go to las vegas, etcetera.
But it's much harder never to be exposed to lotteries.
Because tickets are often sold in the kinds of convenience stores that you have to go to day to day in your ordinary life.
Since many people who have gambling addictions are compulsive, we think that these people are being put in an unfair situation.
In the same way that we don't have cigarettes pushed in people's face at the grocery store in many areas now, we shouldn't have lottery tickets available either.
The other side might tell you, oh but people are exposed to things like beer and cigarettes and lottery tickets all the time and we trust them to make their own decisions.
But we do think that people are more at risk of relapsing into gambling or of being taken advantage of when lottery tickets are sold all over the place.
But the reason why lotteries are especially abusive is because the buy-in cost is so low.
The only thing that's comparable is a slot machine.
But we tell you that at the point where people can go to the gas station and spend one dollar and get a lottery ticket, it's very likely that people are going to be taken advantage of and that those who need help aren't going to get it because they're going to keep spending their money on lottery tickets.
Our third and final argument is that we don't think that lotteries are consistent with regulations on other types of gambling.
In general joe q public is not free to set up a blackjack table in his basement if he wants to.
But in many countries around the world he is free to run a lottery.
Or, more likely, institutions are allowed to run lotteries.
Or on the other hand, in the united states many areas that don't have any form of gambling still allow state run lotteries to be held.
We tell you that gambling regulations ought be consistent.
It's fundamentally unfair to allow one form of lottery, like a state owned lottery or a privately run lottery, and not to allow other forms of gambling, like card games or slot machines.
At that point the government is effectively choosing winners and losers in the gambling market.
We think that this is and by that I mean the market of people selling gambling services, not the people playing the games.
But we think that this is fundamentally unfair in and that states ought either allow gambling in a regulated fashion or not allow it, rather than privilege one form of gambling over another when the harms are all roughly the same.
For these reasons we should ban lotteries.
Thank you."
"We should legalize cannabis for many many reasons.
So, first let's talk about how we're going to legalize it.
This isn't going to be just medical, this is going to be everything - medical and recreational.
In addition to it being fully legalized, anyone who was imprisoned, is currently serving a prison sentence, for any kind of marijuana related offense should immediately be released.
Further, anyone, regardless of if they're currently in prison, or one served, should have their record entirely expunged, and all of their rights restored, if that is their only offense.
Additionally, the state should also pay restitution for all the damages and lives that they took away, because of the the war on drugs they precipitated.
So, why are all these things necessary and just?
So, first let's talk about rights that people have.
I think that at its core, the state doesn't have the right to say that people can't smoke cannabis, I don't or do whatever they want with weed.
So, why do I think this is true?
Keep in mind that, there's a lot of different ways that individuals can choose to live their lives, and if somebody wants to get high, because they enjoy the benefits of it, because they think that it maybe it makes food taste a little bit better, maybe it makes sex a little bit better, maybe it relaxes them a little bit more, their stress if they're like stressed, maybe it can it can do anything, like things like that.
Those are incredibly reasonable decisions that people can make, if they choose to do so.
In the same way that people use alcohol for social lubrications, or you can have a glass of wine after dinner to de-stress or things like that, or smoke a cigarette, these are all things that we accept, because we accept that people have a right to make these choices with their body, but more specifically, they have the choice to make this body things that affect their own internal mental processes, especially when they don't affect other people in any kind of harmful way, because all of the effects of marijuana are limited to the individual self.
So, additionally, I also think it is important, because there's been absolutely no efficacy to the war on drugs whatsoever.
It has accomplished nothing .
It has not led to less people using drugs, in fact it has lead to more people using cannabis.
There's a reason why over fifty percent of people in the united states, which is not exactly known for being progressive on a lot of issues, supports this.
Because, people recognize that it's not working, because people have been using the drugs, and the only thing is that, the drug is getting cheaper, and it's getting stronger and more people are using it, and that's obviously - when you're spending billions of dollars on something - a failure.
But, let's talk about those billions of dollars.
Because the enforcement of these laws, that aren't working, is costing us billions of dollars each and every year, and all of that money could be used on anything, if you could burn those billions of dollars, and it would be more useful than what's happening in the status quo.
But in addition to the fact you're spending billions of dollars, there's a compounding lost, in that you're losing billions of dollars in potential tax revenue, because you can't tax you can't tax people in the marijuana industry who make income out of this, you can't tax the corporations who do these kinds of businesses, you can't tax all the employers and things like that.
So, all of that is additional lost revenue.
But, additionally, it's also bad because if you're worried about things like gateway drugs, or safe use, and things like that, it's only better if you're going to legalize it, and worse if you keep the status quo.
And the reason for that is because, if you're worried about gateway drugs, if you legalize marijuana and you go into a marijuana store, you're not going to find heroin there.
But, if you go to enough marijuana dealers, they'll probably have shrooms, they'll probably have LSD or cocaine, maybe even heroin.
I think that, it's a whole lot more likely that you're going to have these problems.
Additionally, if you're worried about underage use, it's not like a drug dealer, under the table, is going to care about if you're fifty dollars came from someone who's sixteen or twenty five, but obviously, in an institutionalized established store, that has to worry about losing its license to sell, and all of its profits, they're not going to be as willing to give weed away to minors.
So, if your problems are safe access and things like that, then it's clearly just better.
But additionally, you're also not going to have to worry about like the possibilities of there being harmful substances, because you actually know what you're going to get.
So for all those reasons, and honestly many many more, we should legalize marijuana."
"I'm proud to support the motion that we should disband nasa.
Two independent points.
The first is that nasa as an institution has fairly low cost efficacy and when we're talking about public institutions that use taxpayer money it's important to understand that cost efficiency.
First I want to explain why cost efficiency matters in the public sector.
This is probably intuitive but we only have so much money in terms of tax revenue and that has to be apportioned over tons of diverse interests, everything from welfare to small business investment to nasa and at the end of the day we should be analyzing our government expenditures from the perspective of how much good does this do relative to the number of dollars we spend.
That is, if I took all the money that goes into nasa for whatever benefit I derive from having a well funded nasa and poured all that money to say food stamps or into you know housing vouchers or something else would that be a better use of the money.
And it seems like the answer is yes.
While nasa historically was a driver of innovation and historically was well known for having a good multiplier effect, that doesn't seem to be the case anymore.
With a world that is less focused on these really easily you know visible goals things like I want to put a person on the moon stuff like that we think that there has been a departure then from our ability to take nasa's expeditions and convert them into something that is economically viable or even for that matter socially viable.
Things like sending out the you know mars rover whatever are obviously scientifically useful but we think a, on the margins it is probably less useful than other forms of government expenditures but b, we're not particularly convinced that this is something that is actually something that needs to be done by the public sector.
And this brings me cleanly into my second independent point, which is that nasa is crowding out the private sector.
We have developing, especially in the united states, a private sector for space exploration that is extremely promising.
Companies like elon musk's space x seem to be making rapid advancements in the field of being able to privatize space exploration.
We think that this is useful for two reasons.
First, the private sector has clear cut incentives to be competitive and thus make better products.
We think the future of space exploration is something that is more about how we can specifically take things like going out into space or going to other planets and market that to individual people on the ground rather than abstract scientific observations.
I think what the future looks like is more okay we know what mars is like now what we need to do is have some sort of way to make that beneficial for individual people on the ground and we think the private sector is uniquely equipped to do that.
But secondly, the private sector is useful because it doesn't have to deal with the bureaucracy of the public sector.
The public sector is often weighed down not just internally by sort of what you would generally refer to as administrative bloat but also by competition within the government.
We think that unlike in the private sector wheqe competition drives people to do what is best for the economy as a whole by simply bettering themselves, public sector competition forces administrators to play each other down and minimize the importance of other departments in an effort to secure more funding.
What does this look like?
So we think that in budgeting processes this is pretty clear just in a hearing you're essentially badmouthing another department we also think there are more subtle examples, one from the challenger disaster actually showed that the that nasa buckled to pressure from the EPA basically because the EPA was a bigger administration it could just bully nasa into getting rid of these like freon insulators that the scientific data behind their their environmental harm caused was like relatively shaky but what wound up happening then was that because of these administrative and public sector pressures nasa wound up caving to the EPA.
We think that sort of activity's a lot less likely to happen in the private sector where there's less integration between individual institutions and as a result less leverage for one institution to exert its will unjustly over another and for what it's worth to the harm of the average citizen on the ground.
Proud to support."
"We should end the patriot act because the patriot act is incredibly rights violative and it's also it doesn't actually help any kind of real security.
It's fake security.
So, let's start by laying out the obvious ways in which the patriot act is rights violative.
When you're talking about the like massive wiretapping, like widespread wire tap into phones, the widespread data accumulation of people's like data, snoop government snooping into all various kinds of walks of like private parts of people's lives.
Obviously that's incredibly rights violative.
The government is basically able to learn every single thing about you.
It can learn about very personal things about you too.
There's a reason why we have a right to privacy.
Because one of the most basic things that people value is their ability to be left alone.
Their ability not to be harassed, their ability to keep information and things that are important to them private to them in a way in which they choose.
Obviously these things are violated when the government can indiscriminately wiretap on you.
Things like that.
But beyond the indiscriminate and systematic nature of that, there's also no real cause for doing this.
When you're talking about the vast majority of people, most people are doing anything wrong.
Their the information that's being gathered is being gathered rather baselessly.
And even beyond the like fact that there's no real cause for doing this, there is also obviously no legal mechanisms that are in place.
So obviously the right to privacy is an absolute.
We have things like search warrants that you can use to wiretap somebody or search somebody's house.
However these require , this makes sure that you can't abuse on these kind of practices.
So in the same way in which like you don't want the government to just like walk into your house and go through all of your stuff without some kind of real reason for doing so, to make sure that there's real legal mechanisms in place, you don't want them going to your phone.
In a lot of ways, I probably have like a lot of people in the modern digital age, probably have more important personal things on their phone then they do just sitting around in paper documents in their house.
So it's a real violation when you're doing this.
And you want to make sure that you at least have some semblance of legal checks and place.
But the patriot act just completely flouts this by making it so that the government can just basically do whatever it wants with no real legal checks that actually exist, and certainly no real public accountability that's in place.
So even if people would be okay with this, there's not a real public discussion on this.
Because most of this stuff is happening behind closed doors.
So obviously there's no real checks and now that's a big problem.
So now let's talk about the trade off.
All of these rights violations, do they even come with any kind of good in terms of security?
I think that the answer is probably no.
And the reason for this is a couple of things: so first and foremost most threats against the united states probably come from a foreign a lot of them come from foreign entities.
So whether it's like foreign terrorists or foreign actors that are doing harm, foreign hackers, foreign nationals, like all, most threats against america don't originate in america.
Certainly with concerns of things like national security issues.
Obviously there's problems in america, but when we're talking about national security, we're by and large talking about exterior threats.
So already most of the people that you're going through their phones or taking data for, most of these people are just law-abiding american citizens.
So you're not actually doing a whole lot.
This isn't really giving you much.
But further, I also think that this is very unlikely to be successful.
It's basically a fishing expedition.
When you try to go through, like when you you have a country of three hundred million people and you can hope that by searching through like a few million on those phones or whatever, you're probably not actually going to find a whole lot.
People, especially if they're like a terrorist, so they're actually doing harm, they're probably not just flirting out their plans on a phone that they are worried about being wiretapped.
Like even drug kingpins aren't stupid enough to do this.
I'm sure an international terrorist organization isn't going to be doing those kinds of things.
People oftentimes communicate via like a various secure things, people communicate with encryptions, all kinds of things in which the patriot act isn't like actually going to help you with.
You're probably going to need like a more intense surveillance, more intense targeted surveillance, if you actually want to do anything meaningful.
So for all those reasons, we should just end the patriot act."
"The motion for today's debate is that we should legalize sex selection.
What we mean by this is that we would allow parents to use techniques such as microsorting and genetic testing to predetermine whether the fetuses that they're going to be implanting, either into the body or raising from a test tube, are going to be of a specific gender, and then based on those results, we would allow parents to throw away or not or choose not to use a fetus that is of a specific, to them personally, undesirable gender.
For the purpose of this debate, we're going to be talking about men versus women given that it is very difficult to distinguish at the beginning of a baby's birth whether or not they're going to end up being non-binary or trans or anything like that.
Two main areas of clash, first on the rights of parents.
We think that generally people have a right to choose the characteristics of the child that they're going to raise.
They're going to give up so much of their life, money, energy and time, like bringing this child into the world and making sure that they are growing up in a healthy like hopefully happy, hopefully well up provided for home, and as such, we think you you should probably be able to select what where that money and energy and time is going to go.
We think that forms of this are already allowed in the status quo.
We can choose all of our child's influences: what they watch, what they're going to wear, who they're friends with who their teachers oftentimes like where they live, all of these things, and we're just unclear on why there's a specific higher standing for changing your child's genetics with respect to gender.
We actually think it's the burden on opp in this round to show to us why gender and genetics are so much more important than things like where you go to school and like what the main influences in your life are going to be.
In fact, we think that there's actually no difference at all, given that there have been confirmed links between genetic data and the kind of environment that we grow up in, ie, the environment that we have might stimulate our DNA to methylate or phosphorylate, which then change the expression of certain genes.
So, at the point that we literally already allow parents to essentially change and direct their children's genes, we don't know why this is so much more different, and we think that it's naturally stemming from the rest of their rights.
We also think that a child is very much a personal investment on the part of the parents.
Any investment that someone makes is one that you hope to be profitable and one that you need to include your preference, right?
Like, I'm not going to invest my money in a bank or a corporation that I do not believe in or that I think is going to fail.
And so we think that children are very similar in that you don't want to invest all of that energy and all of that time and all of that pain in a child that like maybe you didn't necessarily want or a has certain characteristics that are going to keep it from being able to rise higher in the world.
Like maybe you just really think that women are going to do better than men or vice versa.
Our second area of clash is about mitigating negative outcomes.
Recognize that anyone who cares so passionately about the gender of their child in a world where sex selection is illegal is likely to attempt an abortion either way, right?
Like at the point that they're willing to threaten to do this, to look for means to do this, if they were going to do it on our side of the house, they're likely to still find a way to do so on the opposition side of the house, and we think that this oftentimes takes much more pernicious ways.
Like, recognize that when china instituted the one-child policy, you had a lot of female babies just getting left in the woods after they were born because their parents didn't want them, and they wanted to be able to have another child afterwards.
But, like, recognize that even if we managed to force people to keep these children, it is very likely that they're going to mistreat the child.
Given that they didn't want it in the first place, they don't feel an obligation to take care of it.
We think that you're actually doing a favor to any child who's coming out of these circumstances by making sure that these people are not the ones who are going to be raising it in the long term.
We also think that in more moderate situations, there isn't incentive to misuse it because there's less of a conception that one gender is preferable to the other.
Like, recognize that there are perfectly good reasons that maybe you don't want to have a child of a certain gender.
Some diseases that are really specific to men or women can be cut out almost entirely in this way, and parents who are carriers don't have to worry if they're able to sex select.
And maybe you want another kid but you already have multiple boys or multiple girls.
We think it's fair for you to then say, "" I'm done with this group.
I want a different kind. ""
For these reasons, proud to propose."
