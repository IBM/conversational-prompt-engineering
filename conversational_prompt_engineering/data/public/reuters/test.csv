"Hospital Corp of America said its management believes the 47 dlr per share acquisition offer it received from Charles R. Miller, Richard E. Ragsdale and Richard L. Scott is not in the best interest of shareholders, and it does not plan to meet with the individuals. The company said its board considered information on the three and their bid, and ""Given the lack of any demonstrated ability on the part of these individuals to consummate an acquisition of this magnitude, the board decided it was not necessary to take any action on their proposal at this time.""

"A congressional study today said the proposed, but now apparently abandoned, merger of the Communications Satellite Corp <CQ> and Contel Corp <CTC> would technically be legal but could violate the spirt of the law setting up COMSAT. Two weeks ago before the study was completed, Contel announced it would seek to terminate the proposed merger. The study by the non partisan Congressional Research Service (CRS) said ""the proposed merger appears to comply, technically, with the mandates or letter of statutes, if may nevertheless violate the spirit of the law."" Comsat, created by a 1962 act of Congress, and Contel, a corporation of local telephone and communications firms, filed with the Federal Communications Commission last November 3 an application for merger. Several firms had protested the proposed merger. In an analysis of the law, the research service issued several critical comments about the structure of the new firm and said apparent domination by Contel of a restructured COMSAT would have broken the spirit of the law setting up COMSAT.COMSAT is the U.S. arm of Intelstat, the international satellite communications firm. ...^M"

"Hollinger Inc will pay about 50 mln dlrs cash for its previously reported acquisition of privately owned Unimedia Inc, chairman Conrad Black told reporters after the annual meeting, confirming a published report. Commenting on press reports about the 50 mln dlr price tag, Black said, ""That would not be wildly inaccurate,"" although he declined to disclose the actual cost. Montreal-based Unimedia is Quebec's third largest newspaper group, with three French language daily newspapers in Quebec City, Ottawa and Chicoutimi, Quebec and four printing plants in Ontario and Quebec. Black added that Hollinger would also continue seeking acquisitions of daily newspapers with circulation under 25,000 readers. He said Hollinger was currently talking to about 10 such newspapers in the U.S. where the company currently owns 23 dailies. ""There is really no end to the ones that are available,"" he told reporters, although he added that most remaining acquisition opportunities are in the U.S. He said that Hollinger's 58 pct-owned Daily Telegraph PLC, of London, should become profitable in this year's fourth quarter. For full-year 1987, the Daily Telegraph could break even or better, said Black, citing major reductions in labor costs and improved technology at the Telegraph, Britain's largest circulation quality daily. The Telegraph lost 13.2 mln Canadian dlrs last year. Daily Telegraph chief executive Andrew Knight told reporters after the meeting that the Telegraph's daily circulation had risen by 25,000 since September to about 1,150,000 on weekdays, despite added competition from the new Independent daily newspaper. Knight said The Independent was not affecting the Telegraph's growth, but was making inroads into the circulation of other London quality dailies such as The Times and The Guardian. Hollinger chairman Black predicted Hollinger would post 1987 net income of about 55 mln dlrs, or one dlr a share, including extraordinary gains from previous sales of discontinued operations. Hollinger lost 87 mln dlrs or 6.54 dlrs a share last year on fewer average shares and after an extraordinary loss of 52 mln dlrs. Black told shareholders that first quarter operating earnings on continuing operations amounted to 499,000 dlrs against a year-ago loss of 165,000 dlrs. Revenues on continuing operations rose to 102.1 mln dlrs from 1.5 mln dlrs last year, which did not include Daily Telegraph revenues, he added. Consolidated first quarter figures were not disclosed. He said the Daily Telegraph's first quarter operating loss was sharply reduced from last year."
"Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D-Wis) said he planned to introduce legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders. Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers, Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses. ""We are proposing legislation that would provide for more disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would insure that takeovers are properly financed,"" he said. Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within 10 days, Proxmire said. In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have to filed with the SEC. Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in knowing about coming takeover attempts. Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60 business days from the current 20 business days. His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring company violated the time period on the tender offer. To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin requirments are properly enforced. The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally enforced in hostile takeovers. Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said. He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for failure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct margin requirements. The bill also would require more disclose when several investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover. ""When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know about it,"" Proxmire said. Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all shareholders recieve equal treatment. He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills. Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this month and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring. He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill this year."
