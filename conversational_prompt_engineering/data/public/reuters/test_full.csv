"A congressional study today said the proposed, but now apparently abandoned, merger of the Communications Satellite Corp <CQ> and Contel Corp <CTC> would technically be legal but could violate the spirt of the law setting up COMSAT. Two weeks ago before the study was completed, Contel announced it would seek to terminate the proposed merger.

"Hollinger Inc will pay about 50 mln dlrs cash for its previously reported acquisition of privately owned Unimedia Inc, chairman Conrad Black told reporters after the annual meeting, confirming a published report. Commenting on press reports about the 50 mln dlr price tag, Black said, ""That would not be wildly inaccurate,"" although he declined to disclose the actual cost. Montreal-based Unimedia is Quebec's third largest newspaper group, with three French language daily newspapers in Quebec City, Ottawa and Chicoutimi, Quebec and four printing plants in Ontario and Quebec. Black added that Hollinger would also continue seeking acquisitions of daily newspapers with circulation under 25,000 readers. He said Hollinger was currently talking to about 10 such newspapers in the U.S. where the company currently owns 23 dailies. ""There is really no end to the ones that are available,"" he told reporters, although he added that most remaining acquisition opportunities are in the U.S. He said that Hollinger's 58 pct-owned Daily Telegraph PLC, of London, should become profitable in this year's fourth quarter. For full-year 1987, the Daily Telegraph could break even or better, said Black, citing major reductions in labor costs and improved technology at the Telegraph, Britain's largest circulation quality daily. The Telegraph lost 13.2 mln Canadian dlrs last year. Daily Telegraph chief executive Andrew Knight told reporters after the meeting that the Telegraph's daily circulation had risen by 25,000 since September to about 1,150,000 on weekdays, despite added competition from the new Independent daily newspaper. Knight said The Independent was not affecting the Telegraph's growth, but was making inroads into the circulation of other London quality dailies such as The Times and The Guardian. Hollinger chairman Black predicted Hollinger would post 1987 net income of about 55 mln dlrs, or one dlr a share, including extraordinary gains from previous sales of discontinued operations. Hollinger lost 87 mln dlrs or 6.54 dlrs a share last year on fewer average shares and after an extraordinary loss of 52 mln dlrs. Black told shareholders that first quarter operating earnings on continuing operations amounted to 499,000 dlrs against a year-ago loss of 165,000 dlrs. Revenues on continuing operations rose to 102.1 mln dlrs from 1.5 mln dlrs last year, which did not include Daily Telegraph revenues, he added. Consolidated first quarter figures were not disclosed. He said the Daily Telegraph's first quarter operating loss was sharply reduced from last year.",['acquisition']
"Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D-Wis) said he planned to introduce legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders. Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers, Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses. ""We are proposing legislation that would provide for more disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would insure that takeovers are properly financed,"" he said. Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within 10 days, Proxmire said. In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have to filed with the SEC. Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in knowing about coming takeover attempts. Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60 business days from the current 20 business days. His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring company violated the time period on the tender offer. To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin requirments are properly enforced. The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally enforced in hostile takeovers. Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said. He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for failure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct margin requirements. The bill also would require more disclose when several investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover. ""When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know about it,"" Proxmire said. Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all shareholders recieve equal treatment. He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills. Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this month and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring. He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill this year.",['acquisition']

"President Reagan's nominee as top policeman for the nation's securities markets will inherit an agency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stock price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the globalization of financial markets. David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursday to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeed John Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a record six years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands. The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its investigators have probed into the most colossal insider trading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street. The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed in recent months as a growing number of well known traders and prominent investment banking firms have been charged with wrongdoing. The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after Ivan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most successful stock speculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigators and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal profits after being charged with insider trading. But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred by computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in securities, options and futures. The price gyrations have combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented volatility to some U.S. securities markets. At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers steadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape. And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork for an international securities marketplace in which trading occurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock. Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment opportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce U.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud. Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies, eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's review of hostile corporate takeovers. Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton investment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to the agency upon being named chairman in 1981. In line with the views of other top administration officials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover battles over new federal regulations. The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that topped the agency's enforcement agenda during the administration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat. Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to significantly alter the commission's current priorities. The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them lawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff. The agency is one of the few in the government that actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past few years because of fees it charges public companies, investment banks and other securities firms it regulates. The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency, meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing for policy differences alone. By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party, and the agency prepares its own budget request each year instead of leaving this to the White House. Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins to the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted market manipulations by large investment firms. The agency requires public companies and investment vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on their financial condition and to disclose changes in their condition any time they issue new securities. It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to register with it and comply with investor protection rules, and it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices. Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to become the nation's 35th president. Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served from 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon's first term and was Reagan's director of the Central Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.",['acquisition']

After Rorer announced its second bid for the company last Thursday, analysts forecast that the Robins family, which holds control of the company, would vigourously oppose any merger.

"A bid by San Miguel Corp (SMC) <SANM.MN> to buy back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) has been hit by two new lawsuits, sources in the Philippine food and brewery company said. A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPB from selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC's outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings on April 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a former chairman of both SMC and UCPB. Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF) and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares. Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB and represented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB's plans to sell the shares to SMC were ""a serious breach of fiduciary duties."" The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a government nominee on the company's board. De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders, asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by the company's board. On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per share. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retained earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of dividends. De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt to equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramon del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1. In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties. De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming last December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kong subsidiary <Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares. The loan assumption was again ratified by last week's board meeting. An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by April 15. ""The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of a continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard of the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early disposition of the sequestered shares,"" San Miguel Corp said in a statement. ""Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the government's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement of the controversy by April 15,"" the statement added. A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on Cojuangco's court petition, adding: ""Any statement coming from us might be interpreted as adversarial."" Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which sequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United States citizen. The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln ""A"" shares, which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln ""B"" shares which are available to foreign buyers. SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among prospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by the <A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed institutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers in a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB. The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission on Good Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were owned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the U.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend announced last June. ""We have no objection to Soriano buying the ""B"" shares,"" Diaz told . ""But everything is on hold now."" The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy would be resolved before the company's annual stockholders' meeting, scheduled for May 14. San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion pesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in 1985. It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of 700 mln pesos, an increase of about 50 pct over 1985.",['acquisition']
"Spectra-Physics Inc said it is considering the possibility of recapitalizing, restructuring, or seeking a buyer for the company following its rejection of an unsolicitied 32 dlr a share bid from Ciba-Geigy Corp. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the San Jose, Calif., gas lasers and accessories company also said its board Sunday agreed to a plan that gives 52 top executives bonuses ranging from 20 to 50 pct of their base salary if they stay with the company through August 29. In rejecting the takeover proposal by the U.S. subsidiary of Swiss-based Ciba-Geigy AG, the company said it was unfair. The Spectra-Physics board voted unanimously, with two Ciba-Geigy representatives not participating, to reject the Swiss-based chemical and pharmaceutical company's takeover bid, citing an opinion from its financial advsior, Morgan Stanley and Co Inc, that it is ""inadequate and unfair from a financial point of view to the holders of shares,"" the company said. The board also authorized a special committee and Morgan Stanley to ""vigorously investigate, pursue and authorize any alternatives which would maximize the value of shareholders' investment in the company,"" the company said. Among the alternatives the special committee will consider are a sale of the company to a third party for more than 32 dlrs a share, a recapitalization or restructuring, including self tender offers and/or asset dispositions through the use of dividends, Spectra-Physics said. The ""retention plan"" for the 52 top officers will pay an average bonus percentage of 28 pct of salary, it said. Spectra-Physics said its board approved the plan ""in order to encourage key operating personnel to remain with the company during the period of turmoil and uncertainty engendered by the (Ciba-Geigy) offer."" Under the plan, the executives would be entitled to their cash bonuses if they stay with the company through August 29, but could receive them earlier if they are fired for reasons other than gross and willful misconduct, or if they leave the company because their salaries have been sharply cut. Spectra-Physics also said it filed suit against Ciba-Geigy yesterday in U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Del., charging it with making a takeover bid that was false and misleading in violation of securities law and with violating the intent of July 9, 1985 standstill agreement. Spectra-Physics said Ciba-Geigy indicated at the time of the standstill agreement that it would not make an unsolicited takeover proposal for the company and that the intent of the agreement was that Ciba-Geigy would not acquire more than 20 pct of the company unless there was another takeover threat. Ciba-Geigy was 18.8 pct of Spectra-Physics and Reliance Group Holdings <REL>, which is controlled by New York investor Saul Steinberg, controls 12.8 pct.

"International Multifoods Corp said it filed a suit charging Bregman Partners and its affiliates unlawfully planned to acquire control of the company. In a suit filed in U.S. District Court, International Multifoods said Bregman Partners and its affiliates, who reportedly hold 7.4 pct of the company's shares, tried to induce Multifood's management to join them in an effort to take the company private and give controlling interest to Bregman Partners.

"A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome Petroleum Ltd <DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd <TRP.TO> may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door for more takeover bids, oil analysts said. Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer substantial payments to creditors will expire. Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan. Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as public noteholders in March after several months of delicate negotiations. TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debt restructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd said from Toronto. Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt. ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,"" said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in Calgary. TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed refinancing packages, Gobert said. The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders to agree to a restructuring, he added. ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain any and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said. Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other possible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention to us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little reluctant to come forward,"" he said. Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a confidential agreement between the two companies, he said. Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including TransCanada's. Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings. However, he said not enough financial details are known about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of TransCanada's proposed offer.",['acquisition']
"American Brands Inc's 545 mln dlrs acquisition of National Distillers and Chemical Corp's liquor business is expected to be one of a series of acquisitions by the tobacco company, analysts said. ""They were very frustrated with their inability to get Chesebrough. They said they were looking for an acquisition. It doesn't surprise me that they came up with another one,"" said Allan Kaplan of Merrill Lynch and Co. American Brands failed late last year in its 2.9 billion dlrs bid for Chesebrough-Ponds Inc when Unilever N.V. agreed to buy the company. But since then, Wall Street has been speculating that American Brands would find another candidate to help reduce its earnings exposure to tobacco. ""This is just typical,"" said George Thompson of Prudential-Bache securities. ""There's going to be more to come here. American Brands had to make an acquisition because tobacco is still a significant part of earnings. Their position is a little less favorable than Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds,"" he said. cash flow from its low growth tobacco, but the tobacco business does require great amounts of capital expenditures.

"Publisher Robert Maxwell's British Printing and Communicaton Corp PLC said it filed a lawsuit in U.S. district court against Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc, its directors and advisers to stop, among other things, payment of the special dividend Harcourt is paying as part of its recapitalization. The suit, filed in Manhattan, also names First Boston Corp <FBC> and seeks to void the issue by Harcourt of 40,000 shares of super voting preferred stock to First Boston Securities Corp and the issue of convertible voting preferred stock with 4,700,000 votes in the Harcourt employee stock ownership plan. The preferred shares to be issued to First Boston have 8,160,000 votes. The suit, brought derivatively on behalf of Harcourt and individually in British Printing's capacity as a substantial holder of Harcourt common shares and 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures. The suit alleges Harcourt's special dividend exceeds by more than one billion dlrs Harcout's surplus available for dividends under New York law and contstitutes a fraudulent conveyance. The lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclose that one consequence of the payment of the dividend, which it terms illegal, will be that shareholders will be liable to repay it. Harcourt last week said it would pay 40 dlrs per share to stockholders as a special dividend. Harcourt also announced an extensive recapitalization plan, which analysts said was aimed at thwarting a takeover effort by British Printing. British Printing last week withdrew its 44 dlr per share, or two billion dlr offer for Harcourt because of the recapitalizaton plan. At the time, it said it was reviewing its alternatives. British Printing said it filed the suit after consultation with its advisers. Its lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclose the effect of the special dividend on Harcourt 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures. British Printing alleges the effect will be an enormous increase effective on the June eight record date for the dividend in the number of Harcourt common shares issuable upon conversion of the debentures. British Printing also charged Harcourt is unlawfully coercing debenture holders to convert denbentures before the record date because Harcourt may not have enough authorized common shares to honor conversion after the date. British Printing holds 460,600 shares and 5.6 mln dlrs worth of debentures. The suit also alleges that management, the board of directors, and First Boston engaged in an illegal scheme of entrenchment through a combination of selling to First Boston Securities Corp the super voting preferred at a bargain price, the grant to the company employee stock plan of convertible voting preferred, the six mln share open market repurchase program and the manner in which its financing has been structured.",['acquisition']
"Pentland Industries PLC said it report a substantial capital gain from the sale of part of its holdings in Reebok International Limited, which will cut its stake in Reebok to 32.2 pct from 36.7 pct. It said Reebok filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the offering of six mln shares of Reebok common. Reebok will sell three mln shares and Pentland will sell 1,404,866 shares, reducing its stake in Reebok to 18.1 mln from 19.5 mln shares. After the offering, Reebok will have 56.1 mln shares shares outstanding. Pentland said the amount of the capital gain from the sale depends on the offering price for the Reebok shares to be negotiated between it, Reebok, and the other selling stockholders who will offer about 1.6 mln shares of Reebok common, and the underwriters. Pentland said proceeds from the offering will be used by Reebok to retire bank debt incurred in its acquisition of AVIA Group for about 180 mln dlrs. Is said that afterwards, Reebok will have bank credit lines available for general corporate purposes, including possible acquisitions. Reebok's stock was selling at 45-1/2, up 1/8. At that price, the 1.4 mln Reebok shares Pentland will sell are worth about 64 mln dlrs and the three mln shares Reebok will sell are worth about 136.5 mln dlrs. Pentland said it will use proceeds to fund growth and possible acquisitions. Pentland said 4,500,000 shares of Rebbok will be offered in the U.S. by a syndicate led by Kidder, Peabody and Co Inc and 1,500,000 shares will be offered outside the U.S. by an international syndicate led by Kidder. It said the U.S. underwriters have been granted an option to buy from certain selling stockholders up to an additional 900,000 shares to cover overallotments. Pentland said it has not chosen to participate in this over allotment. Pentland said that as soon as the date and price of the offering have been determined it will release further details.

"Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc officials were not available for comment on market rumors that it is interested in acquiring Reed International plc <REED.L>. Officials of First Boston Inc, Harcourt's financial adviser, declined comment. A Wall Street arbitrageur, who owns Harcourt shares, said the rumors did not make much sense because Harcourt has announced a recapitalization plan to ward off a takeover attempt by British publisher Robert Maxwell.""It's completely inconsistent with the recapitalization, the only way is if they drop the recapitalization,"" he said. Calls to Harcourt seeking comment were not returned. Harcourt's recapitalization will come under scrutiny of a U.S. Court in Orlando, Fla. Monday. The company has sought a declaratory judgment on convertibility of debentures due 2011 in light of the recapitalization. Harcourt said in a statement this week that Salomon Brothers Inc <SB> and Mutual Shares Corp have intervened in the case, claiming ownership of more than 30 mln dlrs face amount of the debenture. In addition, British Printing and Communications Corp, headed by Maxwell, owns 9.5 mln dlrs face amount, Harcourt said. Salomon said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission today that it has 21,978 of the debentures. If the court decides they should be converted at par value of one dlr, they could be converted into 22.0 mln shares. Harcourt is asking the court to rule the company is not required to issue common to debenture holders who did not convert prior to June eight. An increase in Reed shares in London today was attributed by brokers to rumors of Harcourt's interest and also to rumors that Maxwell might be a buyer.

"GAF Corp, set on acquiring Borg-Warner Corp's valuable plastics business, is believed by analysts to be preparing an increased offer for the Chicago-based company. Yesterday, Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for 4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill Lynch Capital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for 89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash and securities for the balance. Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8. ""I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming in with another bid,"" said one analyst, who values the company at 51 or 52 dlrs per share. GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct of Borg-Warner's stock. ""You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to up the price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you have to. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're looking at it - that it's worth more,"" Pershing and Co analyst Richard Henderson said. Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share. GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. Merrill Lynch officials did not return phone calls. Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman sought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plastics business. The rigid plastics are used in such things as telephones, computer terminals, and appliances. ""Where the heck can you buy a world class chemical operation these days,"" said Henderson. ""He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and he does not like to get pushed around,"" said Henderson. GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeover of the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAF did not win the company, it made a substantial gain on its investment in Carbide. Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into its Borg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offer and does not succeed, a higher bid from another company would give GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock. ""It's a win-win situation,"" said one analyst. One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would be forthcoming shortly. ""I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in this book,"" he said. Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts, protective services, which includes Wells Fargo security guards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service. Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who follows GAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, it would realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 per share. ""I think there's a probability he goes up in price,"" said Rose. Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heyman would do. ""Sam's a low-risk, high-return player."" ""Is he trying to build a major industrial chemical enterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank,"" Rose said. Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would add earnings momentum to GAF. ""I worked out that paying as much as 50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, if they sold off most of the non-chemical facilities,"" said John Henry of E.F. Hutton. Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986 operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billion dlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and net earnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986. ""The Borg chemical business is great,"" said Rose, adding its only U.S. competitors are Monsanto Co <MCT> and Dow Chemical Co <DOW>.",['acquisition']
"Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp <GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc <ASH>, the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. ""I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,"" said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co <DOW>, adding, ""There's no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones."" Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. ""I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,"" Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Pace's John Dosher. Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp <UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp <BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace <GRA> has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. ""Companies like DuPont <DD> and Monsanto Co <MTC> spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated,"" Dosher said. ""But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market."" Some top chemical executives share the concern. ""The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes,"" GAF's Heyman cautioned. ""The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long."" Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. ""This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business,"" Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.","['crude', 'acquisition', 'earnings']"
"Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co said it expects to sell its Celeron Corp oil and gas subsidiary for about two billion dlrs in about two months. After the company's annual meeting, Rober Mercer, Goodyear's chairman and chief executive officer, also said Goodyear expects to report a profit of more than one dlr a share from continuing operations in the first quarter. In the same year-ago period, Goodyear reported a loss of 64 cents a share from continuing operations. Mercer said about seven companies are interested in buying Celeron and they may form a consortium to buy the unit. Celeron consists of oil and gas reserves and an almost complete pipeline linking drilling operations in Santa Barbara, Calif., to Texas refineries. Mercer said Celeron's reserves would not be sold separately from the pipeline. Concerning speculation that two billion dlr price tag for Celeron was too high, Mercer said ""There is no fire sale going on here and we can continue to keep Celeron as a profitable operation throughout the year."" Mercer said the expected 1st quarter operating profit was based on the new share total after Goodyear's share repurchase last year to fend off Sir James Goldsmith's hostile takeover bid.","['acquisition', 'earnings']"
"The investor group that has agreed to buy <Computerland Corp> will likely take the leading personal computer retailer public or sell it to other investors, industry analysts said. ""Now's a good time,"" said Joe Levy of International Data Corp. ""The personal computer industry has bottomed out and is on the way up again,"" he said. Earlier today, closely held Computerland, the largest PC retailing chain in the country, said it agreed to be bought by an investor group led by E.M. Warburg Pincus and Co, New York. Neither Computerland, which is 96 pct owned by its founder, William H. Millard, nor E.M. Warburg, a money management and venture capital firm, would disclose the value of the transaction. Analysts estimated that Computerland, whose 800 stores generated 1.4 billion dlrs in sales last year, would fetch 150 mln dlrs to 250 mln dlrs. Computerland franchise owners pay royalties averaging 5.9 pct to the parent company. Officials for E.M. Warburg referred all questions to Computerland. Computerland officials could not immediately be reached for comment. E.M. Warburg currently manages 1.5 billion dlrs in venture capital funds, and its past investments have included Mattel Inc <MAT> and the Ingersoll newspaper chain. It is also a money manager, with 3.5 billion dlrs under management. Although the PC retailers are benefitting from the strong upturn in PC sales, analysts said Computerland must make key changes if it is to fend off advances from rivals like Businessland Inc <BUSL.O> and Tandy Corp's <TAN> Radio Shack stores. ""The name of the game now is outbound sales forces, customer service and customer support,"" said Levy of International Data. Relations between Computerland and its franchise owners have mellowed recently after Millard was forced to give up managment control of the company in 1985. Ed Faber, who took over as chairman and chief executive officer, revamped the company's royalty plan, which help quell much of the franchisee dissent.",['acquisition']

UAL rose 1-5/8 to 73-5/8 on volume of more than two mln shares, after trading with little upward movement earlier in the session.

"Borg-Warner <BOR> Corp, facing an unwanted offer from GAF Corp <GAF>, agreed to a 4.23 billion dlr buyout offer from a company to be formed by <Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc>. Borg-Warner and Merrill said yesterday they entered a definitive merger agreement, under which a subsidiary of the new company, <AV Holdings Corp>, will begin a 48.50 dlr per share cash tender offer today for 77.6 mln shares or 89 pct of Borg-Warner common stock. The offer will be followed by a merger in which each remaining share will be converted into 19.75 dlrs cash and 54.25 dlrs principal amount of AV Holdings junior subordinated discount debentures. As a result of the merger, Borg-Warner will become a wholly owned subsidiary of AV Holdings. A Borg-Warner spokeswoman said members of management do not plan to participate in the transaction, but they will retain their positions with the company. A spokesman for GAF was unavailable for comment. GAF holds 19.9 pct of Borg-Warner's shares. GAF had said it would offer 46 dlrs per share. Borg-Warner's spokeswoman said the company still plans to sell its financial services unit, which includes Wells Fargo security guards, and the Chilton Corp, a credit rating service. Borg-Warner has been the focus of takeover speculation for about a year. Corporate raider Irwin Jacobs last year proposed a takeover of the firm and until recently held 10 pct of the stock. Following the GAF offer, analysts had calculated breakup values for the company in the low 50 dlrs per share range and speculated an offer would have to be sweetened. In its statement, Borg-Warner said its board endorsed the Merrill offer and it recommended that shareholders tender their shares. The board received opinions on the offer from its advisors, First Boston Corp and Goldman, Sachs and Co. James Burke, president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners, said, ""We are very pleased to have entered into this transaction with Borg-Warner. We are looking forward to working with the employees of Borg-Warner and to Borg-Warner maintaining its strong presence in the Chicago community."" Merrill Lynch will be the dealer-manager for the offer, which expires at midnight EDT May 8 (0400 GMT, May 9), subject to conditions, including the completion of necessary financing arrangements. The offer is also subject to a minimum 44.25 mln shares, or 51 pct of the outstanding shares, being tendered. Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates have committed to provide 200 mln dlrs in AV Holdings equity and 870 mln in subordinated financing and forward underwriting commitments. Merrill Lynch said that following discussions with commercial banks it is confident it can obtain the rest of the financing required to complete the transaction. The junior subordinated discount debentures to be issued in the merger will carry a 13 pct coupon and will begin paying cash interest after five years. The debentures will be redeemable at the company's option for the first six years at 105 pct, during the seventh year at 102.5 pct and after that at 100 pct of the principal amount. The junior subordinated discount debentures have a maturity of 20 years and are entitled to a sinking fund commencing in the 16th year designed to retire 60 pct of the issue before maturity. Borg-Warner will also redeem all of its outstanding 4.50 dlrs cumulative preferred stock, series A, for 100 dlrs per share. Holders who wish to participate in the offer must first convert their preferred stock into Borg-Warner common stock. The board of Borg-Warner has also taken steps to redeem its poison pill or share purchase rights for five cents per right, effective immediately.",['acquisition']

"Japan's little-known Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force to be reckoned with, political analysts said. MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S. And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians, they said. ""The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,"" said one diplomatic source. ""They are a potent political force,"" the diplomatic source said. But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts said. ""The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not so internationalized,"" said Waseda University professor Mitsuru Uchida. ""Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world community and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how to face the situation."" Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with London over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keep a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in Japan's lucrative overseas telephone business. The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now monopolizes the business. It has also opposed a major management role in the planned merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on the grounds that no such international precedent exists. The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which has threatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger plan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to open its telecommunications market. Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's car telephone and satellite communications market. Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of the sector it regulates. ""What has been happening is an important shift in the economy which makes the ministry a very important place,"" said James Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory Service Inc. A decision to open the telecommunications industry to competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted rather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said. ""With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto legal framework,"" said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell Whitten. Close links with the powerful political faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, the analysts said. ""Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance of MPT,"" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of the influential political group, he added. The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the Postal Savings System, analysts said. MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal Savings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than banks, they said. Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT's obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized the ministry as feudal. Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said. But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world including Britain, several analysts said. ""The United States is really the odd man out,"" Abegglen said. ""For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable view,"" he said.","['acquisition', 'trade']"
"Enetertainment Marketing Inc and its president Elias Zinn have demanded a list of Crazy Eddie Inc shareholders from the company and said they may pursue a merger of the Edison, N.J. electronics retailer. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Zinn said the demand for the shareholder list was made on June 26 because he may desire to communicate with other Crazy Eddie shareholders ""regarding the affairs"" of the company. Zinn and his firm, which disclosed they hold a 5.1 pct stake in Crazy Eddie common stock, said they may acquire more shares through a negotiated merger or tender offer. Entertainment Marketing was informed on June 25 by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., acting on behalf of Crazy Eddie, that it would be provided with ""certain information"" about Crazy Eddie, it told the SEC. Entertainment Marketing, a Houston-based firm involved in electronics wholesaling and televised home shopping sales, proposed an eight dlr a share merger acquisition of Crazy Eddie on May 29, and modified the proposal on June 9 to include the possible participation of Crazy Eddie management. Entertainment Marketing told the SEC it expects to meet with Crazy Eddie representatives in the near future.

"Robert Fildes, president and chief executive of Cetus Corp <CTUS.O>, told  that Squibb Corp is not interested in buying Cetus. Earlier the companies said Squibb would buy from Cetus a five pct equity postion in Cetus for about 40 mln dlrs. ""This is not an attempt by Squibb to become a major majority holder in Cetus,"" Fildes told  in an interview. ""Squibb has not approached us with any indication that they want to acquire us and we wouldn't be interested in that kind of arrangement,"" said Fildes. Squibb could not be reached to comment on the late comments by Fildes. Squibb is Cetus' first pharmaceutical partner and the only one to own an equity position in Cetus. Eastman Kodak Co <EK> and W.R. Grace <WR> both have joint ventures with Cetus, but neither owns an equity position in the company, said Fildes. Cetus has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnostic products and with Grace to develop agricultural products. Earlier, Squibb and Cetus announced in a joint statement an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to develop new biotechnology products in several fields. As part of the deal Squibb will license several of Cetus' anticancer agents, including interleukin-2, in development. Squibb will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets but not in North American and Western Europe. ""We wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understood that Cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business in North America and Europe,"" said Fildes. He said Squibb was the good partner because Squibb has a major joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of its own in that market. Fildes said Cetus has shunned licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own business. Many large corporations have invested in small biotech firms. But Squibb's investment in Cetus is the first it has made in biotechnology. Fildes said that was attractive to Cetus because it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationship with a large number of other biotechnology companies."" Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drug areas like diagnostics and agriculture, but to ""keep the biggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves."" Fildes said the partnership with Squibb would be used to broaden the company's reach in such big money making areas as the cardiovascular, anti-infective and the anti-inflammatory markets. Squibb is also investming 75 mln dlrs in Cetus' research over the next five years. ""Squibb is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research and development to make it happen, while the equity position part of the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of this partnership,"" said Fildes.",['acquisition']

"The French government's privatisation program, which began late last year, has earned the French State about 52 billion francs to date, the Finance Ministry said. Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revenues raised from the privatisation program would be used in priority to pay off public debt, which stood at 398.2 billion at the end of 1986. The Ministry said in a communique that the returns included banking group Societe Generale <SGEN.PA>, which began its two-week public flotation last Monday. The government has carried out eight flotations, as well as the private sale of telephone group <Cie Generale de Constructions Telephoniques> (CGCT) since its denationalisation scheme began last December with the sell-off of glass makers Saint-Gobain <SGEP.PA>, it added.

Other companies to be sold to the private sector in the near future are television network TF-1 later this month and banking group Cie Financiere de Suez <FSPP.PA> in the autumn. The ministry said TF-1's forthcoming sell-off meant that a third of the government's programme would have been completed in less than nine months. Balladur on Sunday rejected press and opposition charges that the share prices for privatised companies had been pitched too low.

"Ronald Perelman, head of Revlon Group Inc <REV>, may be trying to ignite a bidding war for Gillette Co that could draw some big international players and in the process make a lot of money for himself, Wall Street analysts said. Several hours before a regularly scheduled board of directors meeting, Gillette disclosed that Perelman requested consent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs per share. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in November not to buy stock for 10 years without permission. ""I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and more interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands to make a ton of money,"" said Andrew Shore, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ""In play"" is a term used on Wall Street to describe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling takeover target. Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon gets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through November of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per share. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain of three yesterday. The agreement would be calculated on the basis of Perelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for a split. For example, a deal between Gillette and some other company at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262 mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmen returned telephone calls seeking comment. ""Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money if someone else takes over Gillette,"" said Analyst Deepak Raj of Merrill Lynch and Co. ""I'm not saying that is going to happen but Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45 dlrs per share."" Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasons why Perelman may not be really interested in acquiring Gillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlon private after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two years ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon's operations. ""He's trying to overhaul and improve the image of the dearptment store business."" Another reason is that Revlon has recently made two other acquisitions. Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised if some company such as Unilever plc <UN.AS> or Procter and Gamble Co <PG> decided to take a look at Gillette. Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers for Gillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc <HAN>, RJR Nabisco Inc <RJR>, American Brands Inc <AMB> and Ralston Purina Co <RAL>. ""Perelman is trying to put the company in play,"" said a Wall Street arbitrageur. ""He gets to share in the upside if the company is sold."" Another arbitrageur said he expects Gillette to resist Perelman's overture. ""I can't see the board consenting, what has changed between November and now,"" he said. Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on. ""Perelman never does anything without a fair amount of calculation,"" he said. But he added, ""The Gillette board has to be careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued by shareholders."" Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT, three and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time. According to a copy of Perelman's letter released by Gillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive merger agreement without any financing condition. He said Citibank N.A. is his lead lender and First Boston Inc is his financial adviser.",['acquisition']

It said the offering is expected to raise in excess of 350 mln Canadian dlrs and will be completed by the end of September. The limited partnership will be similar to the Westin Hotels limited partnership completed last year when Allegis sold Westin hotels in San Francisco and Chicago.

The spokesman said the company has not yet identified which of its Canadian hotels will be offered for sale. Allegis has 100 pct ownership in Westin hotels in Vancouver, Calgary, Ottawa and Toronto, and 100 pct interest in Hilton International hotels in Toronto and Montreal. It owns 60 pct of the Westin in Edmonton.

"U.S. District Court Judge Eugene A. Gordon said he will decide ""in the next few days"" whether to grant Burlington Industries Inc's request to stop a takeover by Samjens Acquisition Corp. ""I do not know how I come down on this preliminary injunction,"" Gordon said after listening to arguments by attorneys for 1-1/2 days. ""It's been a long time since I was deluged with as much information as I have been. I have to consider what's been presented and issue an opinion on this. Both sides cannot be winners,"" he said. Burlington requested the injunction to stop a takeover effort by Samjens, claiming the partnership used illegally obtained confidential information about the company to make its offer. It also alleges there would be anti-trust violations if Samjens, formed by Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada, were to succeed. Samjens last week topped a 76 dlr per share offer for Burlington from Morgan Stanley Group <MS> by one dlr per share. Morgan Stanley made its 2.44 billion dlr bid after Samjens bid 72 dlrs per share for Burlington. Burlington lawyers told the court if the injunction is not granted Samjens would win control of Burlington. A Samjens lawyer argued that if the judge granted the injunction it would ""kill the offer"" Jay Greenfield, an attorney for Samjens, said the partnership would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction were granted.

Alternatively, ETL will offer three shares plus 82 cents cash for each Monier share, it said in a statement. As previously reported, ETL moved into the market for Monier shares last week, taking its stake to 13.7 pct by Friday. It now holds 14.99 pct, the maximum allowed without Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. ETL is classified as foreign because of its New Zealand base.

Under the agreement the companies said Continental will acquire General Tire, including its related domestic and foreign operations, and Gencorp will retain liability for the medical benefits of retired General Tire employees who retired on or before November 30, 1984. The sale is expected to be completed on or before November one and is subject to meeting certain conditions. Continental is Europe's second largest tire producer. Last year, the company had sales of 2.6 billion dlrs, with 1.9 billion dlrs generated by its tire operations. Last year, General Tire had operating profits of 79 mln dlrs on sales of 1.1 billion dlrs, and Gencorp had operating profits of 130 mln dlrs on sales of 3.1 billion dlrs. GenCorp spokesman Rip Tilden said the company will retain about 100 mln dlrs in liability for its former General Tire employees under the agreement. Tilden said Gencorp will use the proceeds from the sale to reduce its 1.5 billion dlr debt. In April, GenCorp sucessfully thwarted a takeover by a partnership formed by AFG Industries Inc <AFG> and Wagner and Brown with a restructuring program that included the purchase of up to 54 pct, or 12.5 mln shares, of its common at 130 dlrs a share for a total of 1.6 billion dlrs As part of the restructuring, GenCorp also said it planned to sell its tire business, the bottling operations of its RKO General Inc subsidiary, and RKO's remaining broadcast properties to focus on the company's aerospace and automotive components businesses.

"The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Allied Stores Corp with failing to promptly disclose key steps it was taking last September to thwart a takeover attempt by Campeau Corp. In an administrative complaint, the SEC said Allied and its legal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and the agency that it had begun talks with Youngstown, Ohio, shopping center developer Edward DeBartolo in response to Campeau's takeover offer. Campeau acquired Allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrs on Jan 1, following a battle with DeBartolo. On Sept 25, a day after Allied disclosed that its board had urged rejection of Campeau's Sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs a share, Allied began negotiating the sale of six shopping centers to DeBartolo, the SEC said. Allied legal advisor and director George Kern, who heads the merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell, decided against amending Allied's SEC filing to disclose the talks even though they had resulted in sales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said. Securities law requires takeover target companies to promptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets. The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pct of Allied's stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs a share from 58 dlrs on Sept 29, Allied and a partnership headed by DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed at thwarting Campeau, the SEC said. Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in an amended SEC filing, the agency charged. Allied's first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover was made on Oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on Oct 3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7, the complaint said. DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle for control of Allied, with Campeau winning out later in October when it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock, or 48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutes after it dropped its hostile tender offer. The acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federal judge allowed to be completed, gave Campeau a majority stake in Allied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share. The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joining with Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegal tender offer. But the SEC brief was never filed since the case was dropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo. In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern, the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they comply with reporting provisions of securities laws in the future. Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since it became a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual and quarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt.",['acquisition']

"Merrill Lynch and Co Inc <MER> subsidiary seeking to take over of Borg-Warner Corp said it could realize a 30 mln dlr fee for its efforts, whether or not the deal, which it values at 4.7 billion dlrs, succeeds. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc said it would receive a 30 mln dlr fee from the surviving company for acting as dealer manager of the merger after the Borg-Warner deal is completed. But it said it could also receive a break-up fee of 30 mln dlrs if the deal fails for reasons, which include another party holding more than 40 pct of its stock or tendering for 50 pct. The 30 mln dlr fee is among the highest set down in any tender offer agreement, either in compensation for dealer manager services or for break-up of the deal. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, backed by a group of investors it organized, has launched a 48.50 dlr a share tender offer for Borg-Warner for 90 pct of its stock. The company's board has approved the plan, which was intended to thwart an unsolicited offer from GAF Corp. Borg-Warner also agreed to redeem all outstanding Series A preferred shares and to pay off on all options at a 48.50 dlr a share exercise price before the merger is effective, it said. Merrill Lynch said its representatives discussed a possible leveraged buyout with Borg-Warner as early as last December. At that time, Merrill Lynch told the company it would consider a 43 dlr a share tender offer in cash and securities, if the Borg-Warner board approved, it said. On Feb 24, it said it was told the company had decided against a buyout. But talks were revived after GAF launched its 46 dlr a share proposal on March 31, Merrill Lynch said. Unlike its earlier proposal, Merrill Lynch said Borg-Warner management was asked not to take part in the new deal and it was conditioned upon payment of the fees. In addition to its fees, Merrill Lynch said it will also get up to 17 mln dlrs from Borg-Warner to cover its expenses in the tender offer. Merrill Lynch said it would continue operating Borg-Warner as a subsidiary with its current officers keeping their positions. But for flexibility purposes, Merrill Lynch said it is considering redistributing Borg-Warner's assets to a number of subsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger. All in all Merrill Lynch estimated that there would be 130 mln dlrs in fees and expenses connected with the deal. Another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debt of Borg-Warner, Merrill Lynch said. To finance the deal, Merrill Lynch said it expects to borrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mln dlrs of common stock of the new company, sell 100 mln dlrs of non-voting preferred stock of the new company to Merrill Lynch and Co, sell up to 650 mln dlrs of subordinated notes to Merrill Lynch and Co and sell to the public 204 mln dlrs of subordinated discount debentures.

"Shares of Dome Petroleum Ltd posted their biggest gain in months in the U.S. and Canada as stock markets foresaw a takeover tug-of-war beginning for the debt-heavy company. Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange and gained 31 cents to 1.44 Canadian dlrs on the Toronto Stock Exchange, where it was the most active stock. It rose as high as 1.50 dlrs in Toronto during the day. In recent months, Dome has normally moved by only a few cents per day. TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlr Canadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome's assets, but Dome, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, said it is also still talking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify. Market analysts today said the other two firms are believed to be foreign oil companies, noting that TransCanada yesterday stressed that its bid is ""a Canadian solution to the financial difficulties of Dome Petroleum."" ""The talk is about Conoco, which is controlled by DuPont <DD>, and Atlantic Richfield Co <ARC>, which sold its Canadian interest in 1975 and could be getting back in,"" said Wilf Gobert of Peters and Co Ltd. David Bryson of Moss Lawson and Co also noted that British Petroleum PLC <BP> is mentioned as a possible buyer, despite BP's 70 U.S. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percent of Standard Oil Co <SRD> it does not already own. Calgary-based independent analyst James Hamilton has said in recent reports that Amoco Corp <AN> has also been in talks with Dome. Representatives of Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum, Conoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment. Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as ""awfully optimistic,"" given TransCanada's offer to give current Dome shareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10 dlrs Canadian per common share. Under the offer, current Dome common and preferred shareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, which would own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanada would own 80 pct. However, Bryson said the market may be looking at the potential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. ""The TransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,"" he said. Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is ""at the upper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome."" The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome's creditors 3.87 billion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs), with another one billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available to secured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above a certain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level. Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billion Canadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took on several years ago when oil prices were high and the company wanted to expand. ""There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capable of supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on that basis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,"" Gobert said. Dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that it is a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holds reserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billion cubic feet of natural gas. The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acres of oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta, the heart of Canada's oil industry. Dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres of land across Canada. The company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrs Canadian (1.9 billion dlrs U.S.). It reported a 1986 loss of 2.2 billion dlrs (1.65 billion dlrs U.S.), believed to be the largest ever by a Canadian company.",['acquisition']

"Dutch insurer Stad Rotterdam Anno 1720 N.V. <ASRN.AS> said from July 1 it will own 20 pct of the shares of <Europeesche Verzekering Maatschappij N.V.>, a fully-owned unit of Swiss insurer <Union Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft>. Stad Rotterdam chairman Lucas van Leeuwen told  it may raise its stake to a majority interest if the two companies are found to be sufficiently compatible. Van Leeuwen said that due partly to the fact Europeesche made losses in 1985 and 1986, the 20 pct stake was obtained at below the shares' intrinsic value. He gave no precise sum. The Europeesche, which specialises in travel and recreation insurance, had a premium income of 150 mln guilders in 1986. Stad Rotterdam's premium income in 1986 was 1.17 billion guilders, making it the fifth largest Dutch insurer. Europeesche made a loss of nine mln guilders in 1985, which narrowed to 4.5 mln guilders in 1986, van Leeuwen said. He said the company was on course for independent recovery and was expected to reduce its losses further in 1987.",['acquisition']
"UAL Inc may have a response this afternoon to the pilots union proposal to buy its United Airlines unit, a UAL spokesman said. ""Obviously, we have a lot of movement in our stock, and we need to get a clarification out,"" the spokesman said, adding that there was a ""50-50"" chance a statement would be released today. The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for 2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt. Takeover speculation has driven UAL's stock for several weeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developer Donald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he also held discussions with its chairman. The developer indicated in those talks that he took the position as an investment, but he revealed no other plans. Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buying UAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2 mln shares. ""United has got to consider this proposal. I think the pilot's proposal is realistic. I don't exptect them to take it, but it could put some interesting options in front of UAL management,"" said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst. Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attack when it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertz rental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in a strategy to become a travel service company. The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots union concerned that the company was not focussing enough attention on its airline. UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing its new focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one. But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street has been busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100 dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL as widespread, indicative to them that big institutions believe the stock is in play. Market sources have said that although Trump attracted attention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as a catalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhaps throwing the company into the hands of another buyer. ""The first domino is you have an investor with a considerable stake. the second domino is the union. That type of attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,"" said Pettee. ""What's interesting is the values are there. There's something for everybody,"" he said.",['acquisition']

"Amoco Corp is apparently the successful bidder for debt-laden Dome Petroleum Ltd, according to a published report. The Toronto Globe and Mail, quoting sources close to the negotiations, today said Dome broke off talks last night with TransCanada PipeLines Ltd, which last week announced a 4.3 billion Canadian dlr offer for all of Dome's assets. No financial details about the Amoco offer were available and a Dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that Amoco had emerged the winner, the newspaper said. However, the Dome spokesman indicated that the sale of Dome could be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe and Mail said. Representatives of Amoco were not immediately available for comment. Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, Dome said it was also in talks with two other companies, but refused to identify them. Since then, market speculation has centered on Amoco and Exxon Corp's <XON> 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary in Canada. British Petroleum PLC <BP> and Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD> have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome. In the past two days, Dome management has been pressured by the federal government to select the offer from TransCanada, the only Canadian company in the bidding. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to want to avoid a Dome sale to a foreign company since the government gave Dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to encourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts and officials have said. A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to run afoul of Canadian antitrust laws, however, TransCanada is asking for tax concessions from a federal government that is trying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs, analysts have said. A takeover by Amoco or Imperial would also give a foreign oil company a dominant position in Canada's oil industry. Imperial Oil is already Canada's largest energy company, with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-based Amoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs.

"Deregulation of Japan's oil industry could mean hardship for smaller firms and lead to their merging into bigger refining and marketing groups, industry sources said. They said the relaxation of controls was now under review by the Petroleum Council, an advisory panel to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). A spokesman for a major firm said, ""Deregulation would bring about a reorganization. If it's a by-product of freer competition, we have no choice but to accept it."" The Council is due to close its discussions on June 12. The sources said the Council was likely to tell MITI it should end its 50 year-old protection of the industry. It should cut capacity to 3.8 mln barrels per day, about 75 pct of current capacity. Quotas should end for crude throughput and gasoline output, and oil tariffs should be abolished. They said deregulation was vital to promote more competition and efficiency, and most saw it as inevitable. ""Deregulation is taking place everywhere. Now it's our turn to see if we can survive cut-throat competition,"" said a source at one major Japanese oil company. A spokesman for a smaller refiner said, ""We'll have a hard time surviving, but that's something we must go through."" ""In addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs for the oil division, we will exert efforts towards branching out further into other lines such as real estate and travel agencies,"" he said. Larger companies are also streamlining. Nippon Oil Co Ltd which had the largest share of refined products sales in the Japanese market in fiscal 1985, cut nine pct of its refining capacity in fiscal 1986. Cosmo Oil Co Ltd, the third largest seller of oil products in 1985, cut its workforce by some 20 pct last year, a spokesman for the company said. Between 1984 and 1986, on the recommendation of the Council, 13 oil companies were integrated into 11 companies within seven refining and marketing groups to improve the efficiency of the industry. Oil industry sources said this structure was now likely to be streamlined further into five refining groups. ""MITI means business. It will urge the major seven groups to merge into five to build up their muscles,"" a source said. A MITI official told  he did not rule out the possibility of further mergers within the Japanese oil industry in the event of the relaxation of oil controls. He declined to officially confirm or deny that the Petroleum Council had recommended deregulatory measures but said that in principal MITI would encourage a move towards deregulation.","['crude', 'acquisition']"

The June 25 buyout proposal, which remains open until July 17, also provides that key members of Digiorgio management and some of its directors would be invited to remain with the firm and participate in the group acquiring the company. The proposal is also subject to a due diligence review, execution of a merger agreement, arrangement of financing and receipt of government approvals, all of which Gabelli and Co said could be completed within 60 days.

"Chrysler Corp and Regie Natiionale des Usines Renault said they agreed to extend by up to two weeks the period for reaching definitive agreement on Chrysler's proposed 1.5 billion dlr takeover of American Motors Corp. The letter of intent signed by Chrysler and Renault on March nine set April nine as the target date for completing negotiations. However, the letter also allowed room for an extension of that date to April 23 if an agreement could not be reached. The two companies said they ""now plan to complete work by April 23."" Chrysler and Renault said, ""Given the complex nature of the deal, the need for additional time was to be expected."" The March letter of intent between the two companies says that Chrysler could ask Renault to extend the agreement date ""in the event that prior to April 9, 1987, Chrysler discovers an unforeseen problem in the course of its 'due diligence' investigation of the company,"" referring to American Motors. A Chrysler spokeswoman would not say whether some problem had cropped up in the talks. She stuck by the company's statement that more time was needed because the talks are complex. ""That is our definition of the delay,"" she said. Under the previous agreement between Chrysler and Renault, their letter of intent would be terminated on April nine or when an agreement was reached. But the letter could be amendend by a written agreement by both companies. The Chrysler spokeswoman said, ""We are still working toward a definitive agreement."" Said another Chrysler official who is not part of the talks but who would be told if the deal were in trouble: ""There are no glitches."" Analysts also downplayed the significance of the delay.

"Sumitomo Bank Ltd <SUMI.T> is certain to lose its status as Japan's most profitable bank as a result of its merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said. Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9 trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in October. But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu told  he is confident his bank can quickly regain its position. ""We'll be back in position in first place within three years,"" Komatsu said in an interview. He said that while the merger will initially reduce Sumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand Sumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where it has been relatively weak. But financial analysts are divided on whether and how quickly the gamble will pay off. Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in view of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the merger was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch network from scratch. The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the wisdom of some of those moves. ""They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now it's largely out of their hands,"" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd financial analyst Simon Smithson. Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co. Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5 pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange personnel, or increase the business they do with each other. ""The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,"" said one analyst. But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time. ""U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so, we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three years, not until the 21st century,"" Komatsu said. Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes into the securities business at home. Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial from investment banking. But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu said he hopes further deregulation will create new opportunities. ""We need to find new business chances,"" Komatsu said. ""In some cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust bank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want."" Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such domestic securities business as profitable government bond dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said. He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo. The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon, following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct. But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar decision on a Gottardo subsidiary. ""We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed in two or three years,"" he said. Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to replace disappearing demand from big business, he added. The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo. ""It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,"" said Kleinwort's Smithson. ""After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling around. It will be the next decade before we see if the strategy is right or wrong.""",['acquisition']
"CSR Ltd <CSRA.S> intends to proceed with its planned bid for building materials group Monier Ltd <MNRA.S> despite the counter-bid from <Equiticorp Tasman Ltd> (ETL), CSR executive director Gene Herbert told . ETL said today it would offer 4.15 dlrs each for Monier's issued capital of 156.28 mln shares, plus a share alternative. This compares with a 3.80 dlr cash element in CSR's proposed bid. The proposed offer by ETL, controlled by New Zealand entrepreneur Allan Hawkins, came after it built up a 14.99 pct stake in Monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days. Herbert said Britain's Redland Plc <RDLD.L>, which holds just under 50 pct of Monier, still supported the CSR bid and had told CSR it is not a seller. He said Redland wanted to maintain and build on its operations in Australia and the U.S., Where Monier has built up a strong presence, notably in roofing tile manufacture. The CSR offer contains a put and call option agreement with Redland. This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within six months of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in the same period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR. CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option. ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyond describing it as a long term investment. ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which is a leader in building materials, Herbert said. ""We fit better with Monier,"" he said. CSR has said that it will concentrate development on its core businesses of sugar and building materials after its moves into energy several years ago. Asked what he thought ETL's bid sought to achieve, Herbert said: ""I'm puzzled as to what Hawkins' strategy is. One has to wonder if Monier is the main target."" Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid, and said a higher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals. Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched its original bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late April. The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents on yesterday, after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreign shareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. Its bid is subject to FIRB approval. Herbert also said that institutions, which are more likely to accept a share alternative than cash, would have to judge the respective values of ETL and CSR shares. ETL is the third group to become involved in a possible acquisition of Monier this year. Redland held discussions on a possible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but the negotiations foundered on the price. Share analysts said that for this reason, they did not think ETL's intervention would flush out a full Redland bid although Monier's ultimate fate rests in its hands. ""Redland is still in the driving seat,"" said Tim Cohen of <Ord Minnett Ltd>, adding that Redland would be happier having CSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL. Monier's independent directors have recommended ETL's bid.",['acquisition']

""We've no plan to bid,"" Blair told reporters after a speech to a business group, although he stressed that Nova and 57 pct-owned Husky Oil Ltd <HYO> were interested in Dome's extensive Western Canadian energy holdings. ""But being interested can sometimes be different from making a bid,"" Blair said. TransCanada PipeLines Ltd <TRP> yesterday bid 4.30 billion dlrs for Dome, but Dome said it was discontinuing talks with TransCanada and was considering a proposal from another company and was also talking with another possible buyer, both rumored to be offshore.

"The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just ""rumors."" Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producer has been negotiating with ""many"" U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. ""There have been acquisitions in this area. It's not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning they've done,"" said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. ""They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,"" said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. ""In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make,"" she said. ""You look at their record over the year, and I think they're poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past,"" Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. ""After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people don't find him very credible anymore,"" said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesn't win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens <STN> climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc <FLD>, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4.

"J Sainsbury Plc<SNB.L> said it agreed to take control of the U.S. Shaw's Supermarkets Inc through a combination of share purchases and a tender offer at 30 dlrs a share. Sainsbury bought about 21 pct of the stock in 1983. It said its U.S. Subsidiary, Chene Investments Inc, bought 2.55 mln common shares from the controlling Davis family yesterday at 30 dlrs a share for 76.5 mln dlrs, lifting its stake to 49.4 pct. A tender offer for the outstanding shares will be launched, also at 30 dlrs a share for a maximum further cost of 184.4 mln. The Shaw's Board and the Davis family has agreed to accept the offer, thus assuring Sainsbury's a total holding of 74.0 pct.

"Phelps Dodge Corp chairman G. Robert Durham said the company is prepared to make another large non-copper acquisition and that a deal could be struck in the near future. In an interview with , Durham said the company was examining potential candidates but not yet talking with any. He declined to name the companies but said a deal could occur as soon as the second half of 1987. Phelps Dodge, which ranks as the largest copper producer in the U.S., last year paid 240 mln dlrs for Columbian Chemicals Co, a maker of carbon black which is used in rubber and tires among other products. The purchase was part of a strategic plan to diversify and eventually match earnings from non-copper operations and copper operations. Phelps Dodge could spend between 250 mln and 500 mln dlrs to buy another non-copper company, Durham said, citing about 100 mln dlrs of cash and 580 mln dlrs of untapped bank credit. Any acquisition candidate would have to have a different economic cycle than copper, substantial earnings and good management, he said. Phelps Dodge would only want a friendly deal, he added. ""We're not talking high-tech, or financial services or about a perfume company,"" he said. ""We want a good basic industrial company that will fit into our management structure,"" Durham said. During the interview, Durham and other executives also said continued strong demand and tight copper supply should lead to higher prices for the metal. ""In my view, it's not a matter of if but when the price (for copper) will improve because there aren't that many new projects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession, will continue to grow modestly,"" said executive vice president Douglas Yearley. Phelps Dodge continues to lower its cost of producing copper, the executives said. Costs should be below 50 cents a pound, after depreciation but before interest and corporate expense, by 1989 or 1990. Production costs are about 56 to 57 cents a pound now compared to one dlr a pound in 1981, some Wall St analysts said. Durham said copper supplies are lower than they have been for almost 20 years and demand continued to be strong. He declined to project results for the second quarter or year. But he said the quarter was going well and the rise in copper prices in the last month will help results. Durham said last month that the second quarter should match the first quarter when earnings rose about 11 pct to 16.8 mln dlrs or 49 cts a share. First quarter sales rose 61.5 pct to 372.9 mln dlrs, reflecting the acquisition of Columbian Chemicals and increased copper shipments from the Chino copper mine in New Mexico, also acquired last year. Analysts are projecting 1987 earnings of 2.20 dlrs to 2.75 dlrs a share, up sharply from 1.79 dlrs in 1986.","['acquisition', 'copper']"

"Investor Martin T. Sosnoff said he has raised his offer for Caesars World Inc shares to 32 dlrs each from 28 dlrs and has reduced the number of shares he is seeking to 29.1 mln from all those not already owned. In a newspaper advertisement, Sosnoff said the bid by his MTS Acquisition Corp, withdrawal rights and the proration period will now expire June 19 unless extended. The offer had been scheduled to expire May 15. In late March, Sosnoff said he had received a ""negligible"" number of shares in response to the offer, which had been rejected by Caesars as inadequate. Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30 mln common shares now outstanding, or a 13.3 pct interest on a primary basis. Last week, Caesars' board approved a recapitalization plan as an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholders would receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share, subject to approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held in June. The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mln dlrs in debt to finance the payout. Sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that the amended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to give him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and on the arrangement of financing, as well as to approvals by New Jersey and Nevada gaming authorities. He said the tender would be the first step in acquiring all of Caesars' shares and if successful would be followed by a merger transaction. Sosnoff said later in a statement that the 29.1 mln shares he is now seeking, together with the 4,217,675 shares he owns, would give him a 92.4 pct interest on a fully diluted basis. He said he still has received only a ""negligible"" number of shares in response to his tender. In a letter to Caesars' chairman Henry Gluck included in the statement, Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused, on April 8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing to increase the price of his offer. Sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully in place. Sosnoff said PaineWebber Group Inc <PWJ> has now delivered to him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasing dividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of MTS Holding Corp, an indirect parent corporation of MTS Acquisition. He said Marine Midland Banks Inc <MM>, which leads a syndicate that has provided commitments for a 500 mln dlr margin facility, believes it will be able to arrange for further commitments under the margin facility to advance up to an additional 25 mln dlrs that may be needed to permit the purchase of shares under the offer. Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender, each of the 2,750,000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer, or 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted into Series A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby an independent investment baking firm. He said ""To the extent that fewer than 29,100,000 sdhares are purchased in the offer, the stockholders would receive a combination of cash and Series A preferred stock having a value of 32 dlrs per share of Caesars."" Sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior to Caesars' recapitalization. Sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gaming officials in Nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatory process required for regulatory approval, a process that it already underway in New Jersey. He said his offer has been extended based on the likely duration of the regulatory process. He said he intends to further extend the offer if the approval process is not completed by the expiration date.",['acquisition']
"A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome Petroleum Ltd <DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd <TRP.TO> may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door for more takeover bids, oil analysts said. Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer substantial payments to creditors will expire. Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan. Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as public noteholders in March after several months of delicate negotiations. TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debt restructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd said from Toronto. Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt. ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,"" said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in Calgary. TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed refinancing packages, Gobert said. The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders to agree to a restructuring, he added. ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain any and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said. Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other possible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention to us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little reluctant to come forward,"" he said. Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a confidential agreement between the two companies, he said. Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including TransCanada's. Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings. However, he said not enough financial details are known about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of TransCanada's proposed offer.",['acquisition']
"Atlantic Richfield Co, considering a spin-off of a 20 pct interest in its chemical operations, could gain about 500 mln dlrs from the deal, industry analysts estimated. Yesterday ARCO's stock jumped as much as five points on rumors it was spinning off the chemical operations. Based on about 183 mln outstanding shares, the market in its frenzy was valuing the spin-off at about 900 mln dlrs, analysts said. Atlantic Richfield, aware of the rumors, issued a statement around mid-day that it was considering a sale of only 20 pct of the unit, leading investors to take profits. After the announcement, the company's stock retreated, closing at 93-7/8, up 1-3/8. Today it was off 1/4. ""It was a smaller deal than expected and somewhat disappointing,"" said analyst George Baker at Smith Barney. He said rumors of the spin-off had been around ""for a couple of days."" Baker said the unit was very profitable but it wasn't getting the type of exposure Atlantic Richfield sought, and its value was not reflected in the company's stock price. Industry analyst Richard Pzena of Sanford C. Bernstein said the unit had operating earnings of 132 mln dlrs last year and he expected it to earn about 175 mln dlrs this year. Based on a multiple of 17 times earnings--which Pzena says chemical companies now sell for--the entire unit is worth about three billion dlrs, putting the 20 pct interest at around 500 to 600 mln dlrs. Pzena said he thought the company was selling the stake because chemical margins had peaked, and he speculated the company would use the proceeds to pay down debt. But he added the possibility remained the deal would fall through. Yesterday, ARCO said the proposal had not yet been presented to its board. The chemical unit last year had revenues of 1.9 billion dlrs.",['acquisition']
"A takeover battle began today for debt-burdened Dome Petroleum Ltd <DMP.MO> as TransCanada PipeLines Ltd <TRP.TO> announced a 4.3 billion dlr offer and Dome said it is continuing talks with other possible buyers.

Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had another proposal from ""a substantial company"" and discussions with a third company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in a statement. The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada's bid, but did not identify the companies involved in talks. TransCanada, Canada's largest natural gas pipeline operator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, common and preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary which would own and operate Dome's assets. TransCanada said the offer is to Dome management, not to shareholders. Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada, totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed. It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs. Dome's statement said the TransCanada announcement ""violated the terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement entered into with prospective purchasers"" and was apparently timed to prevent Dome from considering other proposals. It said the TransCanada bid ""seems to require favourable and substantial taxation concessions from the federal and provincial governments."" But Dome added that its management and financial advisers will evaluate all proposals. TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said he was surprised at the vehemence of Dome's statement and denied that TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. ""I find (Dome's statement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision to authorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announce it,"" he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of the other bidders, or the terms of other offers. Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

"Citicorp has extended its reach into the California market with Citicorp Savings' acquisition of 50 of Sears Roebuck's <S> Sears Savings Bank branches, bringing its presences to 143 branches in 101 communities, CitiCorp Savings said. Thrift industry analysts said the move, approved by the Federal Reserve board today, is a plus for Citicorp and shows its serious intent to penetrate the California market. The acquisition mostly extends Citicorp's reach into Southern California, where 34 of the 50 branches are located. Citicorp Savings was predominantly in Northern California. ""This marks our first major expansion in California, particularly in the south,"" said Citicorp Savings President Edward Valencia, in a statement. Thrift industry sources said they do not see a major near-term impact on the Southern California thrift market, but do expect Citicorp to be a more aggressive competitor than Sears was in that market. ""We do believe they will be a better competitor than Sears,"" said James Stutz, Executive Vice President of Home Federal Savings and Loan Association <HFD>, based in San Diego. Banking industry sources said the move is viewed as groundwork, to establish Citicorp throughout the California market, well before the 1991 law change that will allow it to operate as a bank in the state. They said Citicorp is likely to convert the branches to banks at that time. In the near-term, however, analysts said with seven billion dlrs in assets, Citicorp Savings is still not a major force in the thrift market, against such large California thrifts as Home Federal, Great Western Financial Corp <GWF>, H F Ahmanson and Co <AHM>, Golden West Financial <GWD> and Great American First Savings Bank <GTA>.",['acquisition']

"The Bank of New York Corp <BK> said it reaffirmed the terms of its offer for Irving Bank Corp despite the drop in the Bank of New York's share price to 30-1/8, a Bank of New York spokesman said. ""The offer still stands, we have not changed our offer,"" a Bank of New York spokesman said. Irving would not comment on how the drop in the market affects its position on the bid or whether it would buy back any of its own shares. Earlier this month, Irving rejected the bid as inadequate and said it wanted to retain its independence. In late September, Bank of New York offered 80 dlrs per share in cash for 47.4 pct of Irving. For the remaining 52.6 pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for one Irving share. At that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to 80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs per share for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said. According to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tender for all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis. Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop would affect the acquisition. ""If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approve it, but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,"" said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc. ""And the market is saying the deal won't go through,"" Alpert said. ""The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed at present. If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs a share, then they won't go at a lower price,"" another analyst said. The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could afford to retain its original offer. However, industry sources were more uncertain about prospects for the deal. ""With Irving's price so low, Bank of New York's offer will look good to Irving shareholders,"" said Michael Flores, a consultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm. The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which is about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increases the chance that Bank of New York will succeed, Flores said. Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likely to depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the banking industry. ""Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't use their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price is too depressed,"" Alpert said. Since only banks can buy another bank, the only other possible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said. ""In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobbered more than the acquirees,"" another analyst said.",['acquisition']

The holders, none of whom was willing to be identified, said although Harcourt has urged that they convert their shares to common stock by the June eight record date for a special dividend, they were unable to determine if it might be better for them to continue holding the debentures. ""There are rumors that various houses will bring litigation if we don't get answers,"" said a Wall Street source. Officials of Harcourt declined to comment, citing a suit brought by British publisher Robert Maxwell whose has been trying to acquire Harcourt. Executives of First Boston Inc, Harcourt's financial adviser, did not return a telephone call seeking comment. When it announced its recapitalization May 26 Harcourt advised holders of the 6-3/8 pct convertible subordinated debentures due 2011 to convert into common by the June eight record date for the company's special dividend. Harcourt's special dividend pays 40 dlrs per share in cash plus a security worth 10 dlrs. Holders would also retain stock in the recapitalized firm. The debentures had been convertible at 34 dlrs per share. Harcourt's May 26 announcement said the conversion price would be adjusted according to the indenture covering the securities. Arbitrageurs said the conversion formula yielded a ""negative number"" and thus they needed further information from the company.",['acquisition']
"A quickly growing Texas-based distributor of electronics products offered 240 mln dlrs for Crazy Eddie Inc <crzy>, the leading New York City electronics retailer, or one dlr per share more than its founder has bid. The 8-dlr-a-share offer by Entertainment Marketing Inc <em> for Crazy Eddie comes less than two weeks after founder Eddie Antar and a firm controlled by the Belzbergs of Canada announced a bid to take the 32-store Crazy Eddie chain private. Analysts said Entertainment Marketing, whose revenues and profits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into the highly competitive New York City retail market for consumer electronics, the nation's biggest, at a time the fortunes of electronics retailers have sagged. The analysts questioned whether Houston-based Entertainment Marketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whose present buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, had the management expertise for retailing or was merely trying to drive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns. ""I have mixed feelings,"" said analyst Dennis Telzrow of Eppler, Geurin and Turner, a Dallas brokerage. ""On the one hand it's probably a cheap price. On the other hand, does Entertainment Marketing have the management talent to run it and will the Crazy Eddie people leave?"" ""It's a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing,"" said analyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, a Minneapolis brokerage. ""Electronics retailing is very management concentrated; they'd want to keep Crazy Eddie's management in place."" Laurence said that, since Entertainment Marketing already owns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie's 31.3 million shares, it may be trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its 7-dlr-a-share offer. Shares of Crazy Eddie, which have jumped from the high 4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid was announced May 20, rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a share in over-the- counter trading. Antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the New York City, Philadelphia and Connecticut areas, said last month that his group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie's shares. A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company's board has taken no decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrs since they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. He would not comment on the new offer. Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such as disk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods to retailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly to consumers by cable television. In fiscal 1986, ending last January, its revenues rose to 87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year. Net profit went to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750,000 dlrs in 1985. Entertainment Marketing, whose chief executive officer, Elias Zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said in a statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchase of Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to assist in financing the balance. Analyst Telzerow estimated that the company would have to borrow about 100 mln dlrs to complete the proposed buyout since Crazy Eddie has cash and other assets worth about the same amount. Shares of Entertainment Marketing were up 12.5 cents Monday to 9.50.",['acquisition']

"Investor Paul Bilzerian said if Pay N' Pak Stores Inc enters into a merger accord with him he will immediately begin a tender offer for 7.5 mln shares for 20 dlrs per share in cash. Bilzerian told  he believes his offer is superior to a leveraged buyout proposal disclosed in an announcement by the company this morning. The company said it is evaluating both proposals. Bilizerian said he was optimistic his offer will be accepted at a meeting of the board of directors Wednesday. Officials of Pay N' Pak did were not immediately available for comment. Bilzerian said he has a pool of 150 mln dlrs raised by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc available for the tender and ""we may add a bank to that."" ""We've submitted an agreement we're prepared to sign,"" he said. Shares not accepted in Bilzerian's tender would be exchangeable for 20 dlrs in convertible preferred stock. Asked what would happen if the leveraged buyout group, which the company did not identify, topped his offer between now and the board meeting, Bilzerian said he expected an opportunity to respond. Pay N' Pak gave no details about the buyout group, but did say the offer was contingent on financing and on an agrreement regarding management's equity participation. Bilzerian said it was his understanding that the management particpation was ""nominal."" Pay N' Pak fell 1-1/2 to 19. Arbitrageurs said there was disappointment that neither of the offers topped 20 dlrs. ""We were expecting an offer north of (above) 21 or 22 dlrs,"" said one arbitrageur. The leveraged buyout plan was for 17.50 dlrs per share in cash and 2.50 dlrs in 13-1/2 pct cumulative preferred stock. Robert Cheadle, analyst at Montgomery Securities, said ""you have to ask yourself why no one in the industry made a bid."" Scott Drysdale, analyst at Birr Wilson Securities, said the company has not made the best strategic moves over the years. ""They have not done the right things at the right time,"" he said, and as a result earnings per share have steadily declined since 1984. The 57 cts per share in earnings reported for the fiscal year ended in February was lower than 1978's earnings, he said. Earnings totaled 5.7 mln dlrs on revenue of 398.4 mln dlrs. Drysdale said Pay N' Pak has better trained sales people than many competitors, but it competes on price even though competitors have lower costs. The result is squeezed margins. He noted that there have been no other publicly identified bidders stepping forward since the company rejected an earlier Bilzerian proposal in mid-April. Another arbitrageur said it might not be too late for another bidder to get in the game. He speculated that someone in the same home improvement business might be able to offer a deal for stock that would top both the buyout proposal and Bilzerian's plan.",['acquisition']
"share bid made last Wednesday by Union Pacific Corp (UNP), analysts said. ""The offer is inadequate,"" said Douglas Augenthaler, an analyst with E.F. Hutton, noting that it does not represent the needed premium over the company's fundamental value based on earnings estimates. USPCI, which has 8.7 mln shares outstanding, was trading at 48-1/8, down 3/8. USPCI vice president of finance Larry Shelton said he could not comment on the adequacy of the offer or on when the board would meet to consider it. Augenthaler said that while USPCI was trading at only 34 dlrs a share at the time of the takeover bid, its announcement that same day of higher earnings expectations changed its value. USPCI said its second quarter earnings would exceed analysts expectations of 24 to 30 cts a share. At that price, USPCI could maintain a stock price in the low 40s, Augenthaler said. Hutton revised its 1987 earnings estimate for the waste management concern to 1.40 dlrs a share from 1.20 dlrs on the announcment, he said. It lifted its 1988 projection to 1.90 dlrs a share from 1.70 dlrs. In addition, analysts said the hazardous waste management business holds significant growth potential. The industry has grown from 16 to 35 pct over the last five years, based on earnings per share, said Jeffrey Klein, an analyst with Kidder Peabody and Co. The industry is expected to continue growing at 15 to 35 pct over the next five years, he said. Augenthaler said the 43-dlr-a-share offer, or 375 mln dlrs total, would be a bargain for Union Pacific. The transportation and energy company would both gain entry into a profitable business and win cost-control benefits, he said. ""Union Pacific has what are rumored to be some fairly signficant environmmental problems of its own,"" he said. Herb Mee Jr., president of Beard Oil Co (BEC), which holds a 30.4 pct stake in USPCI, said last week Union Pacific's offer was ""grossly inadequate.""",['acquisition']

The plan, adopted in December 1986, permits Clevite to issue shares at half price to existing stockholders and allows stockholders to buy shares of an unfriendly bidder at half price. Clevite said the amendments by its board effectively mean that the so-called flip-in and flip-over provisions of its rights plan can only be triggered by affirmative board approval.

"U.S. District Court Judge Eugene A. Gordon said he plans to issue a decision tomorrow on Burlington Industries Inc's request for an injunction to stop Samjens Acquisition Corp's takeover bid for the company. Wall Street sources have said the outcome of the case could be pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeover battle for Burlington, the largest u.s. textile maker. Gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyers for Burlington and Samjens, a partnership formed by Dominion Textile Inc and New York investor Asher Edelman. Hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow. A preliminary injunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer until the case is decided. Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlr buyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc <MS>, one dlr per share lower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjens last week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjens offer. Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman and Dominion used illegally obtained confidential information about the company in making their takeover attempt. That information, Burlington said, was provided by James Ammeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebber Group Inc <PWJ>. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23 years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington's sales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November, 1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never to divulge inside information about the company. Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he began working with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to ""takeover the company, dismember the company and displace its management,"" Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said. Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information from PaineWebber, but argued the information was public information and could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts or Burlington's public financial statements. Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met with Edelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet with them until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion went public April 24 with their intention to take over the company. Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt a takeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board in February. Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion held discussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting as financial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke off because Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman and dominion with a written statement that they did not provide inside information. Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeen withdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairman Frank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive and threatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in an effort to takeover Burlilgnton. ""The ultimate question is not the price per share or the profit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct for those who would takeover an American company,"" said burlington lawyer Humphrey. Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as the largest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be in violation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada's largest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plants in Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market, the lawyers said. Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said the market for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contends and that Burlington has the ability to switch between light weight and heavy weight denim production as demand and price dictate. Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed by Burlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bid for Dominion. ""Surely, what would have been sauce for the goose would have been sauce for the gander,"" said Sidney Rosdeitcher, a Samjens lawyer.",['acquisition']

"Corporate mergers and acquisitions in and around San Francisco over the past seven years have had only a modest effect on the metropolitan area's economy, a leading business-backed organization said. The Bay Area Council, a group of more than 300 business firms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in a nine-county area found that San Francisco itself had suffered some ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surrounding communities had not. Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area left due to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, but another 21 firms were added to the list. Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco. During the period, only six located in the city achieved Fortune 500 status. Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director of McKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the study grew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriously hurt the economic climate of northern California. However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had been lost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs were created during the period. At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greater rise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the rest of the United States and California. Council President George Keller, who also is chairman and chief executive officer of Chevron Corp., told a news conference that the region had difficulties in persuading companies to locate there because of a fragmented local political system. But he said that because of the amenities of living in San Francisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in other metropolitan area. ""It's a great place to run a business,"" he added, ""but it's a hell of a place to do business with government."" The study concluded that Chevron, which mergered with Gulf Oil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from the restructuring activity. Among the corporate headquarters lost during the period were Crown Zellerbach, Memorex, Southern Pacific, Castle &amp; Cooke and Rolm. Companies that grew enough during the period to make the Fortune 500 list included Apple Computer, Pacific Telesis, McKesson, Tandem Computer, U.S. Leasing and Amfac. The study by the management consulting firm said that, partly due to corporate restructuring, the rate of job growth in San Francisco has slowed since 1980. In addition, it said that the loss of corporate leadership had adversely affected some of the Bay Area's civic and charitable activities.",['acquisition']

"Computer Associates International Inc's 800 mln dlr merger with Uccel Corp <UCE> will eliminate its strongest rival, but the company still faces stiff competition from International Business Machines Corp <IBM>, Wall Street analysts said. ""IBM is still the ruling force in mainframe systems software,"" said Scott Smith, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette. ""But the combination of the two companies will clearly present a much stronger front,"" he said. Besides IBM, ""Computer Associates will be far and away the most powerful company in the field,"" added E.F. Hutton analyst Terence Quinn. That field is a segment of the market known as system utilities, or software packages that boost the productivity of a company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed, power and efficiency of large mainframe computers. The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines the two biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM. Analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms that will find the competition much harder than in the past. For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps a six-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City, N.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry. When the deal is completed sometime in August, the company's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past Microsoft Corp <MFST> as the world's largest independent software vendor. Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wang took the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought 15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3 mln dlrs for the year ended March 31. Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computer businesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframe computer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp. Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after the merger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth. On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of six companies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs. For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, on sales of 141.5 mln dlrs. The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largely because the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also, Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the dark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share. At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different businesses, only three of which were involved in computer software. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and a major Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from his job as chairman of General Electric Co's <GE> computer services unit. Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at a news conference that the merger would give computer users a single source for a wide range of software products. In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates also sell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroads in the applications software market, where analysts said it has been successful with accounting and banking systems. Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support and enhance both companies' product lines, but noted that the company will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He said about 20 pct of the companies' products overlap. Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of current Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. But they joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute Computer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year. Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record of completing acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore, he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05 dlrs a share. Wang said he would look closely at the combined operations of the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketing and research and development. Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel. Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50 dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly 33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share. Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said most software companies are currently valued at about 20 times per-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth the premium because of its earnings potential and customer base. Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25 pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currently owns 58 pct of Uccel. The executive said the merger would not alter his target of maintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct. In addition, he said he expects no problems in having the deal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice Department. Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after the merger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang.",['acquisition']

Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln- U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln- U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition. Dufour said the company has been negotiating with ""many"" U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington Industries was one of them. Burlington's stock rose sharply this morning on the report, which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a takeover offer. Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1 mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. The company has said it plans to diversify into new product and market areas in addition to expanding its textile operations.",['acquisition']
"Amoco Corp's wholly owned Amoco Canada Petroleum Co Ltd said its proposed 5.22-billion- Canadian-dlr acquisition of Dome Petroleum Ltd will benefit Canada just like the foreign investment that made possible commercial development of Alberta's oilsands. Amoco Canada president T. Don Stacy told an oilsands conference that ""Amoco Canada has presented the solution to the Dome problem, and we're investing our confidence, dollars and determination to make that solution work."" The Amoco buyout of debt-burdened Dome has angered Canadian nationalists, who want a Canadian buyer for Dome. Stacy described Amoco Canada's previously reported share offer proposal as a chance to increase Canadian ownership of the country's oil and gas industry, now at about 50 pct. He reiterated that Amoco planned virtually no layoffs of Dome employees. He also reaffirmed that Amoco would reinvest in Amoco Canada-Dome properties all available cash flow for five years after the acquisition.","['acquisition', 'crude']"

It said the sale of Polyco of Cincinnati, Ohio, which makes polyvinyl acetate emulsions, to Rohm and Haas Co <ROH> was announced by the buyer last month. Borden said the divestment of two producers of toy models and hobby items -- Heller in France and Humbrol in England -- is in process.",['acquisition']
"Nova Corp is considering a takeover bid for Dome Petroleum Ltd, either alone or as part of a consortium, Nova chairman Bob Blair said. ""We are thinking about making an offer to Dome or Amoco (Canada Petroleum Co Ltd) or the creditors,"" Blair told reporters before the annual meeting. Amoco Canada is a unit of Amoco Corp <AN>, which has made a 5.2 billion-dlr acquisition offer for Dome. ""There is ongoing, serious thought applied to Dome in Nova and in Husky, but no decision of substance as to future action has been taken in either company,"" Blair said. Nova owns 43 pct of Husky Oil Ltd <HYO.TO>. Blair also said that Nova has made no decision as to whether it would want to be lead partner in a joint purchase of Dome. He added that some of the discussions with other parties about Dome included TransCanada PipeLines Ltd <TRP>, but refused to name the other participants.",['acquisition']
"GAF Corp said it is exploring its options in response to Merrill Lynch Capital Partners' 4.23 billion dlr offer for Borg-Warner Corp, and it has asked for all information that was supplied to Merrill Lynch. A GAF spokesman said the company asked for the information in order to enable GAF to fully evaluate its alternatives. The spokesman also confirmed that GAF did raise its bid to 48 dlrs cash from 46 dlrs per share on Friday. Merrill is offering 48.50 dlrs per share cash for 89 pct of Borg-Warner, and a package of cash and securities for the balance. The transaction with Merrill Lynch will take Borg-Warner private in the form of a leveraged buyout. Merrill Lynch does not intend to sell Borg-Warner assets, but it may be forced to do so in financing the deal, said sources familiar with the transaction. Borg-Warner has said its management is not a participant in the transaction, but managers will retain their positions. The investors involved with Merrill include pension funds, insurance companies and other institutional investors, sources said. Analysts believe GAF, which owns 19.9 pct of Borg-Warner, will raise its offer. That speculation drove Borg-warner stock up 1-3/8 to 49-5/8 in heavy trading. GAF closed at 49-5/8, off 3/4.",['acquisition']
"Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWL.L> said its subsidiary <Hong Kong Telephone Co Ltd> would cease to be a listed company, following the restructure of the company's Hong Kong units. Earlier today the company announced that Hong Kong Telephone and Cable and Wireless Hong Kong, in which the territory's government has a 20 pct stake, would become subsidiaries of a newly formed holding company, Hong Kong Telecommunications. In exchange for the Cable and Wireless Hong Kong capital, Hong Kong Telecommunications will issue 4.18 billion new shares to Cable and Wireless Plc's Cable and Wireless (Far East) Ltd. That subsidiary now holds the group's 80 pct stake in Cable and Wireless Hong Kong and about 22 pct of H.K. Telephone. It will issue an additional 1.05 billion shares to the goverment. That will leave the Cable and Wireless group with an 80 pct stake in Hong Kong Telecommunications, the government 11 pct and nine pct in public hands. But that will be reduced early next year after a placement of 11 pct of the issued shares of Hong Kong Telecommunications by both Cable and Wireless and the government.",['acquisition']
