"Caesars World Inc said it filed a lawsuit against Martin T. Sosnoff and MTS Acquisition Corp regarding its March 9 unsolicited tender offer for Caesars World stock. The company said it filed in the Federal Court in the Central District of California, charging the tender offer, which its board rejected, violated federal securities laws and federal margin regulations. The suit charges the offering materials are materially false and misleading and misstate and conceal material information required to be disclosed to shareholders. The suit also charges the offer is illusory and designed to manipulate the market in Caesars World stock to enable Sosnoff to sell the Caesars World stock he already owns for a substantial profit. The complaint seeks, among other things, to enjoin the tender offer and to require MTS and Sosnoff to correct false and misleading statements in the offer. Caesars World is expected to seek a friendly suitor, restructure operations, or buy back Sosnoff's holdings in an attempt to fight off the bid. Sosnoff holds about 13.6 pct of the company's stock."
"<Nippon Life Insurance Co> is pursing a possible link with an American securities house to expand its overseas investment portfolio, a company spokesman said. But he declined to comment on rumours the company would take a 10 pct stake in <Shearson Lehman Brothers>, an investment banking unit of American Express Co <AXP>. He said the firm started to sound out several U.S. Investment banks on capital participation about 18 months ago and was narrowing the number of prospects, but he did not say if it had set its sights on one firm. Nippon Life, Japan's largest life insurer, also plans to set up a wholly owned investment unit, <Nissei International America>, in New York next month and subsidiaries in Canada, Singapore, the Cayman Islands and Jersey this year, he said. These moves are in line with its long-term strategy to put more emphasis on overseas investment management as opportunities at home are declining while the company's assets are growing. The company is especially attracted by the scale and depth of U.S. Money and credit markets and wants to establish a firm foothold there, the spokesman added."
"Emery Air Frieght Corp, which has launched a 40 dlr a share tender offer for 83 pct of Purolator Courier Corp, said it would sell some Purolator assets to help pay the estimated 265 mln dlr cost of the stock purchase deal. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Emery said it would sell or lease Purolator's air hub in Indianapolis, Ind., which is currently under construction, and would divest Purolator's Stant Inc subsidiary. No indications of interest for the assets have been received so far, Emery said. Emery said it would operate Purolator as a subsidiary if it succeeded in the takever, but would integrate its air hub. It said it plans to finance its stock purchases with borrowings from Chemical Bank, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York, Bankers Trust Co and Salomon Brothers Holding Co Inc, the parent of Salmon Brothers Inc, Emery's financial advisor. Emery said it already has a commitment letter from its banks for up to 129.9 mln dlrs for the stock purchases. An unspecified amount of internally generated funds would also be used for the stock purchases, it added."
"News Corp Ltd of Australia said it has started its previously announced tender offer for all shares of Harper and Row Publishers Inc at 65 dlrs per share. In a newspaper advertisement, the company said the offer is conditioned on received of at least 51 pct of Harper and Row's shares. The offering and withdrawal rights expire April 29 unless extended. A merger at the tender price is to follow the offer, which has been approved by the Harper and Row board. Harper and Row has granted NEw Corp an option to buy up to 800,000 new shares or a 15.4 pct interest at 65 dlrs each. News Corp said if the merger agreement were terminated under certain circumstances, News would be entitled to a 16 mln dlr cash payment. Last month, Theodore Cross offered to acquire Harper and Row for 34 dlrs per share but was soon outbid by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc, which offered 50 dlrs per share. Late in the month, Harper and Row said its board had received expressions of interest from a number of domestic and foreign companies."

"Trans World Airlines said it told the Securities and Exchange Commission it does not intend to seek control of USAir Group or to acquire more of its stock at this time. TWA also said it is amending its application with the Department of Transportation to seek control of USAir.

"Cooper Basin oil producer Santos Ltd <STOS.S> said it will bid 4.00 dlrs a share for the 96.03 pct it does not already hold in diversified oil and gas company <TMOC Resources Ltd>. Santos said the bid values TMOC at 248.5 mln dlrs. It said it already holds 1.91 mln of TMOC's 25 cent par shares. TMOC held interests outside the Cooper Basin region of South Australia and Queensland and the acquisition would further the Santos objective of developing as a broadly based oil and gas company with interests outside its existing base in the Cooper Basin, the company said in a statement. Santos said TMOC holds several important domestic oil and gas production, exploration and pipeline interests. In the Northern Territory it has a 43.75 pct stake in and operates the Mereenie oil and gas field in the Amadeus Basin and owns 32 pct of <N.T. Gas Pty Ltd>, owner and operator of the Alice Springs to Darwin gas pipeline. In Queensland, TMOC has extensive interests in the Surat Basin, including the 100 pct owned and operated Moonie oil field and 33 pct of the Boxleigh gas field. TMOC owns 80 pct of the <Moonie Pipeline Co Pty Ltd> which owns and operates the Moonie to Brisbane oil pipeline. TMOC also holds 25 pct of the Jackson to Moonie oil pipeline, 20 pct owned by Santos. Output from the Naccowlah block, 40 pct owned by Santos, provides the bulk of the throughput of both pipelines. TMOC has exploration interests in a number of areas in the Amadeus, Surat, Eromanga and Canning basins. It also has oil and gas interests in Britain's North Sea, Ecuador, and the U.S., Along with gold and base metal production through its associate <Paringa Mining and Exploration Co Plc>, Santos said."
"Beaver Creek State Bank in Beaver Creek, Minn., failed and the bank's insured assets were transferred to Citizens State Bank of Silver Lake, Minn., the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said. Separately, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Victor Federal Savings and Loan Association of Muskogee, Okla., was placed into receivership. Beaver Creek's two offices will re-open as branches of Citizens on Monday. The transfer was arranged because there were no bids to buy Beaver Creek, the FDIC said. Citizens will pay a premium of 30,000 dlrs to the FDIC and purchase Beaver Creek's assets for 5.3 mln dlrs. It was the 43rd bank failure in the nation this year. The FHLBB said Victor Federal Savings was insolvent and its assets were transferred to a newly chartered federal mutual association with directors named by the FHLBB. Victor was a stock association with 564 mln dlrs in assets. The new association is to be known as Victor Savings and Loan Association and its assets continue to be insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp, the FHLBB said."
"A. William Reynolds, chairman and chief executive of GenCorp Inc, told shareholders he expects to announce a company alternative to a 100-dlr-per-share hostile tender within a week. Last night the company urged shareholders to reject the tender. Reynolds urged shareholders to be patient, saying the group sponsoring the tender offer had months to evaluate GenCorp while ""we have had only 10 days to respond."" Reynolds also disclosed the company has resolved legal challenges to its planned sale of WOR TV, serving the New York City market, and expects to complete the sale by Friday. Reynolds said the company expects to book an after tax gain of 250 mln dlrs from the sale of WOR TV. The company plans to sell the station to MCA Inc <MCA> for 387 mln dlrs. Reynolds did not specify whether the legal challenges were dropped or dismissed. The Federal Communications Commission has already approved the station's sale. Money from the sale of the station will play a role in helping develop an alternative to the tender offer co-sponsored by AFG Industries Inc <AFG> and Wagner and Brown, Reynolds said. He provided no other details. Randall Hubbard, chairman of AFG, and Joel Reed, chief financial officer of Wagner and Brown, attended the meeting, which was shifted from a tire plant to a downtown hotel. About 300 people were present despite an overnight snowstorm. Hubbard and Reed chatted briefly with Reynolds after the meeting but declined to discuss their proposal with reporters. Reynolds told the shareholders friends and family members have been telling him ""Bill, just don't pay greenmail"" to end the takeover threat. Greenmail describes a buyout of a minority shareholder at a price not available to other holders. Reynolds said he considers it a ""repugnant device."" Shareholders elected management's slate of 11 directors. Mario Gabelli, head of a New York investment firm which owns a large block of stock, proposed one nominee for the board. Gabelli said the unsuccessful attempt was designed to ""stiffen the backbone of the board to discourage greenmail."" Hubbard and Reed reiterated previous statements that they are open to negotiations with GenCorp. Asked about severance contracts for key executives in the event of a shift in control of the company, Reynolds asserted ""we're developing alternatives that would not result in a change in control."" Asked whether the company's plan would be superior to any proposal of AFG and Wagner and Brown, Reynolds commented, ""We know the company, we know the values and we know the opportunities better than any outside group."" In response to a question about whether any units are up for sale, he said only that GenCorp is evaluating alternatives."
