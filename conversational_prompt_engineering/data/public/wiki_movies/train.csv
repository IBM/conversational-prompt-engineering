Lazy Eye was produced by Todd Shotz and Tim Kirkman through their company T42 Entertainment, in collaboration with Sugarloaf Productions, Shawn & John Productions, and 5 Child Productions. John Ainsworth, Gill Holland, Zvi Howard Rosenman, and Leesa Wagner served as executive producers. The original score was composed by Steven Argila.
The film was shot in Los Angeles and Joshua Tree, California in 12 days.

Lazy Eye premiered at the Provincetown International Film Festival on June 17, 2016. In August 2016, Breaking Glass Pictures acquired North American distribution rights to the film, and released it in theaters on November 11.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 62% of 13 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.7/10. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 39 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating ""generally unfavorable"" reviews.
David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter called Lazy Eye ""tedious"" and wrote, ""The locations are certainly pretty, as are the actors with their tidy matching beards, lounging about in tasteful nude scenes with lots of meticulous crotch-masking. Some of those moments are almost Austin Powers-worthy. But Kirkman's characters are not the least bit distinctive."" Rooney also described it as a ""drippy, cliché-ridden movie.""
Owen Gleiberman of Variety gave a positive review, stating that the film ""is so well-written and acted you feel like you're eavesdropping"" and ""is voyeuristic, but in a far more refined and emotionally sophisticated way."" Gleiberman also opined that it ""is a small-scale movie, but there are far bigger dramas that don’t leave this kind of afterglow.""
Stephen Holden of The New York Times concluded his review by writing, ""Lazy Eye has realistic dialogue and believable performances by its stars. But unless you consider subjects like saltwater swimming pools and the movie Harold and Maude fascinating topics, Lazy Eye has little to say. On a more personal level, the conversation touches on issues like monogamy and raising children, but what is said is merely superficial; yada, yada, yada.""
Katie Walsh of the Los Angeles Times called the film ""sexy and emotional"" and commented that ""Kirkman and cinematographer Gabe Mayhan capture the sun-dappled beauty of the landscape, and the central performances both anchor and lift the film."" Walsh also wrote, ""A couple of flashbacks color in their history but feel unnecessary, as the script and actors ably express the complicated history between the two men.""

Børning 2,"Børning 2 is a 2016 Norwegian action-comedy directed by Hallvard Bræin, and produced by Filmkameratene. It is the sequel to Børning (2014) that have taken inspiration from the American Fast & Furious film series.
Anders Baasmo Christiansen plays the main character, Roy Gundersen, who gets out of prison for participating in the illegal street race to Nordkapp. He is challenged to a new illegal winter race from Bergen to Murmansk in the north of Russia, but refuses, as he wants to focus on spending time with his daughter. But then he hears that his daughter is participating in the race together with her boyfriend.
The movie premiered on the 12th of October 2016. The script was written by Linn-Jeanette Kyed and Anne Elvedal, following the story by  Christopher Grøndahl.
A sequel, Børning 3: Asphalt Burning, was filmed in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Germany that ended with a race in the world known race track Nürburgring.

Roy gets out of jail after 2 years, for participating in the illegal street race to Nordkapp. He is determined on getting his life back on track. He has hit rock bottom, gone bankrupt, and in a desperate attempt on restoring his life and being a good role model for his daughter, Nina, he takes a job in a gas station.
Roy's pregnant girlfriend hosts a ""out of jail""-party, where some of his old racing enemies shows up and challenges him to a new race. The race starts in Fosnavåg, going through Sweden and Finland, before ending up in Murmansk in north Russia. Roy wants to keep his sheets clean, and refuses to race. That is until he finds out that Nina is attending the race together with her boyfriend Charley, and he has to stop her.
The race is wild and tough, going over mountains, icy roads and frozen waters. The race becomes a chase between the racers and the police, who are doing what ever they can to stop them.

Like the first film, Børning 2 became an immediate success in the Norwegian box office, selling over 55 000 tickets on the day of the premiere breaking the Norwegian record, and accumulating over 212 000 viewers the first 5 days of showing. The film ended up with over 383 000 views. The movie has an approximate total budget of $2,500,000.

Børning 2 received mixed to positive reviews from the critics.
Birger Vestmo from NRK P3's Filmpolitiet praises the movie for its driving and stunts in the winter snow and ice. ""The movie is well done visually, where the colourful cars are a great contrast to the snow white landscapes they are racing through"". He rated the movie a 4 out of 6.
Morten Ståle Nilsen from VG.no says what the movie lacks in story and relationships, it makes up for in the driving scenes. ""The sentimental side of the movie feels even more insecure than the previous movie, where it now is full of relationships it is hard to believe (including the central relationship between father and daughter)."" Nilsen rated the movie a 4 out of 6.
The film reviewer from Dagbladet, Aksel Kielland, criticizes the movie for the way it portrays the female role in the movie. ""It doesn't matter that the script is written by two women (Anne Elvedal and Linn-Jeanette Kyed) or that the bikini ladies from the first movie is gone - ""Børning 2"" is about as hostile to women as it is possible for commercial Norwegian entertainment to become in 2016."". With this he rates the movie a 2 out of 6.

Børning 2 has been nominated to 4 Amanda Awards, including the People's choice award, and 1 Kosmorama Award.

The film preceded the inception of the UK's Black Lives Matter movement.
The film premiered at Sheffield Doc/Fest on 14 June 2016. It released on Netflix UK & Ireland on 1 October 2020.

Starting in 2014 and ending in 2016.

From ‘die-ins’ to ‘Black Brunches’ they organise civil resistance around issues as diverse as police brutality, gentrification and the migrant crisis.
The acclaim and notoriety they get is short-lived, however. The leader of the London Black Revolutionaries threatens to bring the group down just as they’re getting established and through their misplaced energies R Movement risk losing their most passionate members.
The film ends at a widely reported protest at Heathrow airport. This coordinated day of action saw roads shut down in Birmingham, Nottingham and Heathrow.

The film world premiered at Sheffield Doc/Fest in 2016 and had its London premiere at the East End Film Festival. It went on to tour the UK with Picturehouse Cinemas and was taken around the United States, Brazil and Argentina in 2017.

She Loves Me (film),"She Loves Me is a filmed version of the 2016 Broadway revival of the musical of the same name by Joe Masteroff, Jerry Bock, and Sheldon Harnick. The musical itself is based on the 1937 play Parfumerie by Miklós László. The production is staged by Scott Ellis and choreographed by Warren Carlyle. It stars Laura Benanti as Amalia Balash, Zachary Levi as Georg Nowack, and Jane Krakowski as Ilona Ritter. The production was performed at Studio 54 from March 17 to June 5, 2016.
The film was broadcast live on BroadwayHD on June 30, 2016, making it the first Broadway production to be live-streamed. It has also aired several times on Great Performances on PBS.

The plot follows Amalia Balash and Georg Nowack, two workers in a Budapest parfumerie in 1934, who despise each other. Unbeknownst to them, however, they have been sending anonymous letters in a lonely hearts club and are slowly falling in love with each other. A subplot involves the on-again, off-again relationship between the dim-witted Ilona Ritter and the cocky Steven Kodaly, two other co-workers at the parfumerie.

Jim Walton as Maraczek's Investigator/Ensemble
Michael Fatica as Busboy/Ensemble
Cameron Adams, Justin Bowen, Alison Cimmet, Benjamin Eakeley, Gina Ferrall, Jennifer Foote, Andrew Kober, and Laura Shoop appear as additional ensemble members.

The film is executively produced by Stewart F. Lane and Bonnie Comley, the founders of BroadwayHD. While the production is staged by Ellis and Carlyle, the film is directed and shot by David Horn, who had previously worked as a producer and director for Great Performances on PBS. Ten cameras were used to film the performance.

The idea of making theatre more accessible to patrons not in New York City or who simply did not have the money for a Broadway ticket had been in the works for many years. The inspiration for  a live-streamed performance, however, came quickly after the #Ham4Ham trend in 2015 where Hamilton performers would do a short performance outside the Richard Rogers Theatre for fans waiting to get tickets. These mini-performances were allowed to be filmed and spread on social media using the ""Ham4Ham"" hashtag. Due to these small shows, which were performed three times a week, Hamilton ticket sales began boosting. The trend was even a segment at the 70th Tony Awards in 2016, where each musical nominated would do a small performance outside their theater for fans. Some inspiration for live-streaming musicals came from the live musicals shown on NBC and Fox such as The Sound of Music, Peter Pan, The Wiz, Grease, and Hairspray.
Comley told The Hollywood Reporter that the goal of the live-streamed performance was, ""...to expand the reach of the show outside the physical Broadway theater.”

The film was live-streamed on BroadwayHD on June 30, 2016. It was historic, as it was the first Broadway musical ever to be live-streamed. Following the streamed performance, the film had a one-day theatrical release on December 1 of the same year in a partnership with Fathom Events.
Since then, the film has been aired multiple times as episodes of Great Performances on PBS.

Over sixty countries tuned into the live-streamed performance on BroadwayHD. A Facebook live video showing a teaser of the production garnered 307,000 views and 1,712 shares. Tickets for the event were $9.99, though subscribers of BroadwayHD could watch for free.

Austin Hill of Onstage Blog described the experience of watching the show live, ""...Though I love filmed stage productions, they are always lacking that connection to the event, as though losing the ephemerality of the moment—the precise phenomenological moment of theatre-making.  This was somehow different, and I am not sure I understand why.  It might be because it was REALLY live…""

The streamed production was nominated for three Shorty Awards for Entertainment, Facebook Live, and Live Streaming Video at the 9th Shorty Awards.

"Solo, Solitude","Solo, Solitude (Indonesian: Istirahatlah Kata-Kata) is a 2016 Indonesian biographical drama film written, directed, and produced by Yosep Anggi Noen about disappeared activist and poet Widji Thukul.

Solo, Solitude tells a dramatized story of Widji Thukul, a poet whose works were known to be critical of the Suharto regime in Indonesia. When a riot broke out in Jakarta in July 1996, Thukul remained steadfast in his criticisms despite looming threats. He was scapegoated by the government as a provocator and fled to Pontianak and lived in exile for 8 months.

According to producer Yulia Evina Bhara, the idea to make the film began with an initiative to create murals of Indonesian poets which she was a part of alongside writer Okky Madasari and women's rights activist Tungal Pawestri. Once she decided to produce the film, she hired Noen to helm the project.
While developing the film, Noen read Thukul's poems and met with his friends. Writer Mumu Aloha developed the story before Noen made it into a screenplay, after which the production team decided that the film would focus on Thukul's time while in exile in Pontianak.

Solo, Solitude premiered at the Locarno Film Festival in Switzerland on 9 August 2016. It received a limited theatrical release in Indonesia a few months later on 19 January 2017.

According to producer Yulia Evina Bhara, the film had garnered 51,424 admissions within the first month of its release in Indonesia. While not a commercial success, Bhara noted that the number reflected an ""extraordinary"" reception from local audience for an independent film.

In a review for Tirto, writer Dea Anugrah criticized the film for depicting Thukul as someone who ""turned his back on Java, the main arena for politics and culture in Indonesia"" while ""hiding in fear"". Anugrah also criticized the character of Ida which he called inconsequential to the film's narrative and the film's screenplay as ""excessive"" and ""redundant"". While also noting the film's focus on Thukul's fear and paranoia, Adrian Jonathan Pasaribu of Cinema Poetica wrote that the ""paranoia is translated beautifully in the film’s visual grammar"". In contrast with Anugrah's review, Pasaribu instead praised the film for ""not romanticiz[ing] Thukul as some kind of superhuman [...] who is sometimes powerless in his struggle against tyranny and injustice.""
Discussing the film's ""very slow pace and lack of action and dialogue"", Panos Kotzathanasi of the Asian Movie Pulse called the film ""not easy to watch"", while also noting that ""if one can overcome these restrictions"" the film ""comes across a very beautiful and meaningful film that highlights the benefits of 'slow cinema'."" Similarly, Clarence Tsui of The Hollywood Reporter highlighted the film's ""surreal images"" of ""long sequences of quotidian life"". Tsui further compared the film favorably to Anocha Suwichakornpong's By the Time It Gets Dark which ""offers a poignant reflection of humanity drawn from the turbulent recent histories of Southeast Asia.""

Pool Party Massacre,"Pool Party Massacre is a 2016 American comedy horror film written, directed, and produced by Drew Marvick.

What started as a relaxing summer day by the pool for a group of high-maintenance young socialites quickly becomes a nightmare when an unknown killer begins stalking and murdering them one by one.

Marvick intended the film to be a throwback to 80s slasher films. He enlisted the film's shooting director prior to writing the script. The film had a shooting budget of $6,000. Marc Schoenbach was brought on to create the film poster, which Marvick wanted to have the feel of an 80s horror film.

Pool Party Massacre had its world premiere at FearNYC on October 22, 2016, the festival's inaugural year. This was followed by a release on April 20, 2017.

Critical reception has been favorable from horror and pop culture outlets. Rue Morgue wrote a favorable review, praising the practical effects while stating that the movie had issues with its pacing. PopHorror was similarly favorable, as they felt that it was a ""fairly standard campy slasher film, but don’t take that to mean that it’s predictable. There are some nice twists and turns along the way, some of which I was able to figure out and some that caught me off guard."" A reviewer for the Library Journal was also favorable, writing that ""It brought me back to the horror films of the 80's, which was Marvick's intention. Massacre was silly, bloody, and fun—just the way I like it. Stick it next to Friday the 13th and Sleepaway Camp on your shelf immediately. ""
Scream magazine was more critical, stating that ""Singularly dedicated to delivering a slasher flick in the form of its base elements, Pool Party Massacre is admirable in its commitment to its own simplicity, even if that means it has to bulk up its run-time with excruciatingly tedious characters spewing excruciatingly tedious dialogue.""

In 2019 Marvick launched a crowdfunding campaign on IndieGoGo to fund a sequel. He had not initially planned to create a sequel for Pool Party Massacre, ""mostly because I never really thought anyone would watch the movie"", but began writing one after being approached by fans. The campaign was successfully funded within ten days and Marvick has stated that the film's script has been inspired by sequels such as Slumber Party Massacre II, Return of the Living Dead Part II, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2.

Ukraine on Fire (2016 film),"Ukraine on Fire is a film directed by Igor Lopatonok and premiered at the 2016 Taormina Film Fest. It features Oliver Stone, the executive producer, interviewing pro-Russian figures surrounding the Revolution of Dignity such as Viktor Yanukovich and Vladimir Putin. The film portrays the events that led to the flight of Yanukovych in February 2014 as a coup d'état orchestrated by the United States with the help of far-right Ukrainian factions. The film's central thesis is that the U.S. had used Ukraine as a proxy against Russia for many years. It also claims that a large and influential section of Ukrainian protestors involved in the 2014 Revolution of Dignity were neo-Nazis.
The film was regarded by critics as presenting a ""Kremlin-friendly version of the events"". It was also criticized for advancing the Russian narrative about the revolution.

The film starts by recounting historical themes such as the Cossack Hetmanate, World War I and the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the annexation of Western Ukraine by the USSR, the Great Patriotic War, Ukrainian collaborationism in World War II, the massacre of Jews at Babyn Yar, the Volyn massacre of Poles and the guerilla war of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army against the Soviets up to the mid 1950s. 
The film says that during the Cold War, the CIA maintained contact with Ukrainian nationalists in order to have possible channels for counterintelligence towards the USSR, mentioning Ukrainian nationalist leaders including Mykola Lebed, Stepan Bandera, Dmytro Dontsov, Andriy Melnyk and Roman Shukhevych. 
It then maintains that the free market economy which was introduced after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the ""crazy 1990s"", gave rise to a small class of oligarchs who acquired vast wealth and power, while leaving the majority of the population in poverty.
A big part of the film is dedicated to far-right politics in Ukraine, including the organizations Svoboda, Tryzub and Right Sector. 
The film mentions the Orange Revolution in which Ukrainians rejected a fraudulent presidential election, and then portrays some aspects of the Maidan protests, including the negotiations over a trade agreement with the European Union, the role of NGOs, and the appearance of US politicians such as Chris Murphy and John McCain. The film states that the Maidan protests, initially peaceful, began to escalate with the involvement of radical elements, including Right Sector activists who were purportedly brought to the Maidan to ""muscle"" the peaceful demonstrations.
After that, the film presents Oliver Stone's interviews with Viktor Yanukovych and Vladimir Putin, in which they expound their view of the situation in 2013 regarding the trade agreement and why negotiations were paused. The film also covers selected aspects of the events leading to Yanukovych's removal from office by the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's parliament, claiming that the impeachment against him was unconstitutional.
Finally, the film presents events of the following months, including the invasion and annexation of Crimea by Russia, the war in eastern Ukraine, and the downing of the airliner MH17 by a Russian missile. The film criticizes NATO's eastward expansion and the imposition of sanctions against Russia. It questions the legitimacy of the post-Yanukovych government in Kyiv.
The film concludes by presenting the concept of the Doomsday Clock, which indicated a high level of global risk in 2015 due to the modernization of nuclear arsenals.

The film premiered at the Taormina Film Festival in Italy on 16 June 2016; thereafter, it did not receive a general theatrical release but was published as DVD on 18 July 2017. Later, the documentary became also available in the video on demand market via Apple TV and Amazon Prime and since June 2021 also on YouTube.

It was aired in Russia on national television network REN TV in November 2016.
In March 2022, it was reported that the film had been removed from YouTube and Vimeo. YouTube explained they ""removed this video for violating our violent or graphic content policy, which prohibits content containing footage of corpses with massive injuries, such as severed limbs""; subsequently, the film was uploaded to Rumble for free viewing. As of 12 March 2022, the film was again available on YouTube, this time with a content warning attached.

The film was regarded as presenting ""a Kremlin-friendly version of the events"". According to the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, ""“Ukraine on Fire was derided for advancing the Russian narrative about Ukraine’s 2014 Euromaidan revolution, portraying it as a nationalist coup orchestrated by the United States"".
Rod Dreher, writing for the American Conservative, said: ""I expected 'Ukraine On Fire' to be propaganda, and indeed it was. But that doesn't mean it is entirely a lie, and in any case, it's important to know how the other side regards a conflict, if only to understand how they are likely thinking.""
Andrew Roth, writing from Moscow for The Guardian, said that Ukraine on Fire is part of ""a series of documentary projects featuring Stone about Russia and Ukraine that reflect a strongly pro-Kremlin worldview"", remarking further that ""Stone has noted that the films, which are strongly critical of the 2014 maidan revolution and have been attacked as propaganda vehicles, are very popular in Russia.""
Stephen Velychenko, the University of Toronto's Chair of Ukrainian Studies, strongly criticized Stone's pro-Russian bias. While Velychenko accepts the possible involvement of the CIA, he allocates only a minor role to it compared to domestic political forces and argues that the film's focus on external forces only will lead to apologetics or conspiracy theories.
Writing in Collectible Dry, Antonio Armano criticized that the film does not mention either Stalin's dekulakization or the Holodomor, a man-made famine organized by the Soviet regime, events which he argues may explain why the Nazi occupation during World War II was seen by some Ukrainians as welcomed liberation. Comparing Ukraine on Fire with the documentary Winter on Fire released one year earlier (and portrayed the 2014 revolution positively), he stated that Ukraine on Fire is a ""less narrative and emotional"" journalistic product. According to Armano, the film's main message is to avoid a new Cold War between the United States and Russia with the potential for nuclear confrontation.
James Kirchick of The Daily Beast called the film a ""dictator suckup"", noting that ""Yanukovych ceased being president on 22 February 2014 because he fled Kiev, rendering himself incapable of performing his presidential duties under the Ukrainian constitution. Over three-quarters of the country’s parliament, including many members of Yanukovych’s own party, voted effectively to impeach him that day"", and ""It is astoundingly patronizing for Stone to lecture Ukrainians—thousands of whom have fought and died defending their dismembered country from an all-out invasion by their much more powerful neighbor—about what they do and do not know about Viktor Yanukovych, Russia and the potential for a new Cold War"".
Pavel Shekhtman, a Russian dissident persecuted by Russian authorities for alleged extremism, writing for the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group, also called the documentary ""undistilled Kremlin propaganda"", arguing that, of the main Ukrainian political figures described as neo-Nazis by Stone, only Oleh Tyahnybok resorted to xenophobia and antisemitic rhetoric.

Retake (2016 film),"Retake is a 2016 American LGBT drama directed by Nick Corporon and starring Tuc Watkins and Devon Graye. It premiered at San Francisco's Frameline Festival in 2016 at the historic Castro theatre. The film went on to screen at multiple film festivals and was picked up for distribution by Breaking Glass Pictures, playing in Los Angeles in January, 2017. It was released on VOD and DVD later that month.

The mysterious Jonathan (Tuc Watkins) travels to San Francisco and looks to hire a male escort. He initially hires Scotty (Kit Williamson) and it does not go well. He returns to the streets and finds an unnamed hustler (Devon Graye). After a night of sex and polaroids, Jonathan offers to pay the escort to accompany him on a road trip to the Grand Canyon, no questions asked. Eager to leave his own life behind, the escort accepts and the two start out on a road trip through the American Southwest. Jonathan asks the hustler to go by the name “Brandon.” The two have an immediate connection and Jonathan starts to have the escort wear specific clothes and put on specific attitudes. The escort investigates and finds a photo of someone named of “Brandon” in Jonathan's shaving kit. Instead of leaving, he cuts his hair to match the photo. Their connection grows as they continue on their trip. “Brandon” pushes Jonathan to open up and have fun while Jonathan pushes him to continue to play the role. One night, Brandon is able to get Jonathan out of his shell by getting him to skinny dip in a hotel pool, where they are caught by an adventurous straight couple, James (Derek Phillips) and Iris (Sydelle Noel). Jonathan sneaks out of the hotel and listens to a mysterious tape of someone singing to him.  
They continue their road trip and run into Iris and James again at a local bar. Brandon incorporates them into the evening and is able to get Jonathan to loosen up even more, even dancing with Iris. On a drunken ride back to their motel, Brandon gets Jonathan to pull over and open up a bit. Instead of talking, they share a dance in front of headlights, where Jonathan talks about how he was always looking to the future, never in the present. Brandon feels for him and they return to the motel.
The next morning, Jonathan is mugged outside of the hotel room and returns nursing a bruise. Brandon calms him down but feels something's off. He goes outside to check a packet of old polaroids and finds out most of the trip - including the mugging - are all fake, a set up to relive a road trip with the real Brandon (Andrew Asper). The hustler confronts Jonathan about the whole thing being fake - even their natural chemistry. Jonathan reveals that Brandon died of an overdose on their road trip and he's merely trying to relive it. Angered, he pays off the hustler who leaves.
Jonathan sadly goes through his old polaroids of the original Brandon, his lover, and we see their original road trip from years prior. The hustler hitches a ride from a local woman, Debbie (Jody Jaress), who gives him a lift. In the motel room, Jonathan finishes listening to the old tape recorder - Brandon singing to him before he died. The hustler and Jonathan meet at a bar where Brandon tells his story and reveals he was kicked out of his house as a teen and started hustling because he didn't know what else to do. He laments that he doesn't know who he is or what he wants, but Jonathan does. They both agree to start over and the hustler reveals his name, Adam from Dayton, Ohio. They reconnect emotionally at the motel, staying up all night talking.
The next morning, Adam finds Jonathan gone with an envelope of money for a bus ride home.  He goes to the bus station to buy a ticket back to Dayton as Jonathan finishes his drive to the Grand Canyon, alone, but strengthened by his connection with Adam. He stares at the emptiness of the Grant Canyon and an uncertain future.
