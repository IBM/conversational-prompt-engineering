A man runs away in fear, looking over his shoulder, where he is admitted to the hospital after an accident, and is in a coma. DCP Sharat Chandra/Shakthivel is called upon to investigate the matter, where it is found through the security cameras that a corpse of a high-profile businesswoman Maya is missing from the morgue. Meanwhile, Maya's husband Akshay is surrounded by his family and friends offering their condolences, but he drives them out saying he wants to be left alone. Once they all leave, he drives to his girlfriend Bhoomi's house, where it is revealed Akshay killed his wife and made it look like a heart attack. The cops call Akshay over his cell phone and ask him to arrive at the forensics lab and explain the issue. Akshay drinks a glass of wine offered by Bhoomi and leaves, where he is asked to stay in the lab until they discover the corpse.
In a series of clues and flashbacks, Akshay is made to believe that Maya is still alive and is out for vengeance. He keeps in contact with Bhoomi, until Sharat Chandra/Shakthivel receives evidence that can allow him to arrest Akshay, in the form of a toxin BL-18 that can induce a heart attack. It is revealed that Akshay drugged a glass of red wine with BL-18 to kill Maya. He interrogates Akshay, who reveals how Maya and him met the first time. After getting locked up in a room, Akshay calls up Bhoomi and finds out that Maya's lawyer Krishna Prasad is in fact a private detective hired by Maya to spy on Akshay. He asks Bhoomi to run away afraid that Maya is after her. When Bhoomi comes out of the building, a car comes speeding towards her and Akshay fears the worst.
Akshay confesses everything to Sharat Chandra/Shakthivel and repeatedly requests him to save Bhoomi. Sharat Chandra/Shakthivel gets a call from Deva, who tells that they found a body, revealed to be Maya. Sharat Chandra/Shakthivel further confirms that there was no one called Bhoomi in the university and flat as mentioned by Akshay, and that Bhoomi was non-existent. Akshay tries to escape, tailed by Sharat Chandra/Shakthivel. Sharat Chandra/Shakthivel then reveals that the car accident in which Sharat Chandra/Shakthivel's wife had died was caused by a drunken Akshay and Maya. Although Sharat Chandra/Shakthivel's daughter Amritha repeatedly calls for help, Maya tells Akshay to leave them, due to which his wife dies.
Amritha had been in a coma for two years and when she woke up, she remembers the car license plate, which she tells Ranjith, who tracks them down. It is revealed that Bhoomi is actually Amritha, and it was an elaborate plan orchestrated by Sharat Chandra/Shakthivel and Amritha due to which Maya was killed. Sharat Chandra/Shakthivel further reveals that the glass of wine Amritha had offered to Akshay before leaving contained BL-18 and it has been 8 hours since it entered his bloodstream. Akshay dies in a heart attack and Sharat Chandra/Shakthivel walks away from his dead body.

Ramesh had narrated the story to Arjun who agreed to work on the film and helped contact Manisha Koirala about playing the film's leading female role. Shaam was selected to play the film's main antagonist, a role initially planned to be played by the director himself. Arjun also helped the makers get in touch with composer Ilaiyaraaja to compose two songs for the film. The team shot in Chennai in February 2015, with Oru Melliya Kodu, a dialogue taken from Gautham Vasudev Menon's Yennai Arindhaal (2015), adapted as the film's Tamil title.
In April 2015, actress Khushbu was approached to play Arjun's wife in the film but turned down the offer. The actress later sought a public clarification from the team if the story was based on the death of Indian businesswoman, Sunanda Pushkar, and urged the team to narrate the story with sensitivity. Ramesh, however, refused to confirm Kushboo's allegations and turned down her request of divulging the film's plot to the media. During December 2015, the director revealed that production was complete and that postproduction and censoring works were ongoing.

A critic from Deccan Herald said that ""The film, which boasts of a surprising twist in the climax and a subtle message, has all trademark Ramesh’s style of film making"".

Tamil version
A critic from The Times of India wrote that ""It is a pity that the film fails to cross that melliya kodu [thin line] between being 'not boring' and 'compelling enough'"". A critic from Deccan Chronicle gave the film a rating of two-and-a-half stars and wrote that ""Despite few glitches, OMK is worth a watch for its gripping making"". A critic from The New Indian Express said that ""Though not one of the best scripts to come out in the suspense-crime format, the film could be a one-time watch for lovers of the genre"".

As Mother's Day nears, a group of seemingly-unconnected people in Atlanta come to terms with their relationships with their mothers.
Sandy is a divorced mother of two sons, Mikey and Peter, whose ex-husband, Henry has recently married a younger woman, Tina. Still getting used to this, she meets Bradley, a former Marine, in the supermarket. Bradley's wife Dana, a Marine Lieutenant, died a year previously, leaving him with their two daughters, Vicky and Rachel.
Kristin, adopted from birth, has her own daughter, Katie, and mulls over marrying the father of her child, Zack. She considers her life incomplete and her friend Jesse encourages her to search for her birth mother. Jesse also happens to be Sandy's best friend.
Jesse is married and has a son, Tanner, with Russell, who is Indian. Her sister Gabi is married to her wife Max and has a son, Charlie. When their racist, homophobic parents, Earl and Florence, unexpectedly show up, they have to come to terms with who their daughters are and the partners they have chosen. 
As she's in Atlanta promoting her latest book, Miranda, an accomplished author and television personality, gets a surprise visit from Kristin, who is her daughter who she was forced to give her up for adoption at birth, as she was very young. Their making up leads to Kristin asking Zach to marry her on air and marrying on the same day, so Miranda can participate.
Jesse and Gabi's parents ambush them and their partners on their camper-van, and with Russell's mom's help through Skype, force him to make up with Jesse. Later on, the families including his mom, who flies in from Vegas, celebrate Mother's Day with a picnic in the park.
Sandy and Bradley meet again by chance in the hospital. She's there because of her younger son's asthma attack, he because of a mishap in the Mother's Day party he was throwing which ended with his going to the hospital for a broken leg. Helping her get unstuck from a vending machine, combined with his daughters' encouragement, Bradley finally starts to see her in a positive light.

Indignation (film),"Indignation is a 2016 American drama film written, produced, and directed by James Schamus. The film, based on the 2008 novel of the same name by Philip Roth, is set mostly in Ohio in the early 1950s, and stars Logan Lerman, Sarah Gadon, Tracy Letts, Linda Emond, and Danny Burstein.
The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 24, 2016, and was released theatrically on July 29, 2016, by Roadside Attractions and Summit Entertainment. Lerman's performance received positive reviews from critics and earned him a Best Actor nomination at the Seattle Film Critics Awards.

Marcus Messner is fighting in the Korean War. After an encounter with Chinese troops, he reflects on the choices he made in his life and how they led him to where he is now.
In the summer of 1951, before his first year of college, Marcus's synagogue in Newark, New Jersey mourns the death in Korea of one of his classmates. Marcus has been awarded a scholarship to Winesburg College, a private Christian school in Ohio, which allows him to defer the draft. His father, who runs a kosher butcher shop, is unnerved by the deaths in the war of boys like his son and becomes overwhelmed with paranoia.
At Winesburg, Marcus is a studious, introverted pupil who feels disconnected from the rest of the student body, including fellow Jewish students. He meets Olivia Hutton, a beautiful student majoring in French literature. The daughter of a Cleveland surgeon, Olivia is freethinking, sophisticated, and sexually frank, but also fragile and disturbed; she feels as alienated and out-of-place as Marcus. On their first date, Olivia ends the evening by performing fellatio on him. The inexperienced Marcus is so shocked that he avoids her for several weeks. As he and Olivia continue to have sexual relations without intercourse, he learns that she is a recovering alcoholic who had been previously enrolled at Mount Holyoke College. After she attempted suicide, she was admitted to the Menninger clinic. Olivia's parents sent her to Winesburg hoping that the ""squareness"" of the school would help her become stable. She also makes strong allusions to having been sexually abused by her father.
Marcus decides that he can no longer tolerate his noisy, intrusive roommates and requests to switch to a single room. The university administration schedules a meeting with Dean of Men Caudwell. Though the discussion is ostensibly about the change in his living situation, it becomes an interrogation about Marcus's atheist beliefs and his dislike of Winesburg's conservative culture. The already ill Marcus becomes so agitated that he vomits and passes out.
Marcus is rushed to the hospital, where he has an operation for appendicitis. During recovery, he is visited by a senior student who informs him that Olivia has given blow jobs to nearly everyone else on campus. Marcus's mother also visits him and says that she wants a divorce from his father, who is growing increasingly deranged and can no longer run the shop. She meets Olivia, who has come to bring red and white roses to Marcus, and sees the wrist scar from her suicide attempt; they speak away from Marcus when leaving. The next day, Marcus's mother apologizes to him for oversharing her marital problems and promises not to divorce, but only if he ends his relationship with Olivia. She warns him of the dangers of getting too involved with people who are mentally ill, and that her neediness would ruin his potential.
When Marcus returns to school, he finds that Olivia has disappeared from the campus and goes to Dean Caudwell to find out what happened to her. Olivia suffered a nervous breakdown and was hospitalized again. The school had been hesitant to accept her, given her history of electroshock therapy and relapses, but her father was an esteemed Winesburg alumnus who requested her admission. The Dean demands to know whether Marcus raped and impregnated Olivia; Marcus is outraged and leaves after using an obscenity.
Marcus is expelled after the Dean learns that he paid a student to evade the mandatory chapel requirement, and is drafted. In Korea, Marcus is stabbed with a bayonet during combat. As he collapses, he thinks back on Olivia and wishes that he could tell her that ""it's okay, whatever it is. 'Cause someone did love you. At least, I think that's what it was"". Decades later, Olivia lives in a nursing home. She notices the red and white roses on the wallpaper, so similar to the ones she once gave Marcus, and smiles.

Peter Debruge of Variety gave the film a positive review, writing: ""Schamus opted to make Philip Roth's 29th novel his own first feature, choosing an emotional and incredibly personal piece of material (it fictionalizes Roth's own early-'50s college experience) that adapts well to his polite, polished and reasonably old-fashioned aesthetic.""

Fifty Shades of Black,"Fifty Shades of Black is a 2016 American slapstick romantic comedy film directed by Michael Tiddes and starring Marlon Wayans, who also serves as co-writer and co-producer.

The film was released theatrically on January 29, 2016, to universally negative reviews. Despite this, it was a box office success, grossing $22 million worldwide from a $5 million budget.

Christian Black introduces shy college student Hannah Steale to the world of ""romance"" after she interviews him for her school newspaper. Their kinky relationship stumbles forward despite Christian's shortcomings as a lover and the antics of his racist adoptive mother Claire, his well-endowed brother Eli and Hannah's hyper-sexual roommate Kateesha.

On June 3, 2015, it was announced that Open Road Films had acquired the US distribution rights to the yet-to-be made film for $5 million.
Principal photography on the film began August 11, 2015, in Los Angeles.

The film was released in North America on January 29, 2016, alongside Kung Fu Panda 3, The Finest Hours, and Jane Got a Gun.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 4% based on 46 reviews; the average rating is 2.79/10. The site's consensus reads, ""Wildly erratic even for a spoof movie, Fifty Shades of Black bears the unfortunate distinction of offering fewer laughs than the unintentionally funny film it's trying to lampoon."" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 28 out of 100 based on 11 critics, indicating ""generally unfavorable reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""C"" on an A+ to F scale.
Critic Mark Kermode dismissed Fifty Shades of Black as another lame parody film, among the likes of Scary Movie (2000), Epic Movie (2007) and Vampires Suck (2010). Austin film critic Korey Coleman ended his review by starting an online petition to stop Marlon Wayans from making any more parody films. He gave it the #1 spot for the worst movie of 2016, tying it with Yoga Hosers.
Kermode was critical of the humor: ""Cue jokes about wallet and car theft, fried chicken and Bill Cosby, alongside glasshouse/brick complaints about EL James being a rubbish writer. When it all runs out of steam, the cock-and-ball routines downshift into riffs from Whiplash and Magic Mike, but sadly, these aren’t funny either."" J.R. Jones condemned the jokes as a set of ""amplified racial stereotypes and misogynistic swipes"", citing the running gag of male characters calling Hawk's character ""ugly"", as well as the rape jokes, as examples. Henry Barnes claimed there is a ""Cosby joke, a Kanye joke and huge spaces where the laughs should be"", particularly arguing that the ""abuse is amplified out of the realm of satire into a weird hinterland of really unfunny gross-out and blaxploitation revenge flick"".
Jones did, however, highlight the ""impressive attention to detail, meticulously re-creating the original film's costumes and sets, and Kali Hawk nails her Dakota Johnson impression as the virginal protagonist"".

Anthropoid (film),"Anthropoid is a 2016 war film directed by Sean Ellis and starring Cillian Murphy, Jamie Dornan, Charlotte Le Bon, Anna Geislerová, Harry Lloyd, Toby Jones and Marcin Dorocinski, It was written by Ellis and Anthony Frewin. It depicts Operation Anthropoid, the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich by exiled Czechoslovak soldiers Jozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš in World War II. It was released on 12 August 2016 in the United States and 9 September 2016 in the United Kingdom.

In December 1941, German occupation in Europe has neared its height. Two agents from the Czechoslovak exile government, a Slovak soldier, Jozef Gabčík and  a Czech, Jan Kubiš are parachuted into their occupied country. Jozef is injured when he crashes through a tree upon landing, but both men set out to find their contact in the resistance movement. They are discovered shortly afterwards by fake resistance fighters who turn out to be traitors; one is shot by Jozef but the other man escapes. Stealing their truck, the agents head for Prague.
When they seek out their contact, they are directed to Dr. Eduard, a veterinary surgeon who stitches Jozef's injuries. Eduard informs them their contact was arrested by the Gestapo and arranges for them to meet other resistance members, led by ""Uncle"" Jan Zelenka-Hajský and Ladislav Vaněk. Gabčík and Kubiš reveal that they are under orders to carry out ""Operation Anthropoid,"" the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, the main architect of the Final Solution, and the Reichsprotektor of German–occupied Czechoslovakia.
With limited sources of intelligence and equipment, Jozef and Jan must find a way to assassinate Heydrich, an operation which they hope will incite further Czech resistance against the occupation. With the help of two young women, Marie Kovárníková and Lenka Fafková, along with other plotters, the agents plan to ambush Heydrich along the route to his headquarters at Prague Castle. When the agents learn that Heydrich is about to be transferred to Paris, the plan goes into effect straightaway with the duo bolstered by the addition of other agents who have been parachuted into Czechoslovakia, and the remaining resistance fighters in Prague.
On 27 May 1942, the assassination attempt is carried out; Jozef's Sten submachine gun jams, but Jan throws a  makeshift grenade which detonates under Heydrich's limousine, seriously wounding Heydrich before Jan and Jozef flee the scene. In response to the attack, SS security forces round up thousands of Czech citizens and carry out reprisals, during which Lenka is killed trying to escape Nazi arrest. Heydrich dies from his injuries a few days later.
Reprisals continue with the village of Lidice destroyed, its male population over the age of 16 summarily murdered, and the women and children sent to concentration camps. Fearing that his own family may fall victim to the reprisals, Resistance fighter Karel Čurda contacts Karl Hermann Frank, Heydrich's replacement as Reichsprotektor and betrays the others for amnesty and the reward being offered. The Moravec family who had sheltered Jozef and Jan while they planned the attack are arrested by the Gestapo. Marie Moravec commits suicide with a cyanide pill, but her son, Ata Moravec, is tortured by the Gestapo until he reveals Jozef and Jan's hiding place in a concealed basement of the Saints Cyril and Methodius Cathedral in Prague. Hundreds of troops storm the cathedral where all the Resistance agents hiding there, engage in a fierce last stand, killing many German soldiers before they are overwhelmed and are killed or commit suicide, including Jan. As the SS ultimately break into the crypt, Josef Valčík, Jaroslav Švarc, Jan Hrubý and Jozef commit suicide to avoid capture. Before Jozef kills himself, he is comforted by a vision of Lenka reaching her hand out to him.

In March 2015, Jamie Dornan and Cillian Murphy were cast in Anthropoid, with Sean Ellis directing a screenplay written by Ellis and Anthony Frewin. In May 2015, LD Entertainment boarded the film, announcing the casting of Charlotte Le Bon.
The film was shot entirely in Prague during the summer of 2015, and where possible, at the actual locations of the events they depict. Director Sean Ellis stated in interview that scenes in the Orthodox Cathedral of Saints Cyril and Methodius were filmed on an exact replica of the church on a studio backlot, so as to make the location recognisable to Czech viewers. Gestapo and Czech contemporary reports allowed Ellis to recreate the film's final act (the assassination and church siege) with extreme accuracy, and intense planning was necessary to allow for the assassination itself to play in real time, with each resistance member's movements researched, planned and tracked in order to reflect actual events.
The principal photography for Anthropoid includes backdrops such as Prague Castle and the Charles Bridge in Prague, the locations where Operation Anthropoid took place. At the premiere screening and later advance screenings, audience members noted that the authentic street scenes were featured in the film.

In July 2015, the first image of Dornan and Murphy was released. In May 2016, Bleecker Street acquired U.S distribution rights to the film. In June 2016, the first trailer was released.
Anthropoid had its world premiere at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival on 1 July 2016 as the opening night film. It was released in the United States on 12 August 2016.

On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, Anthropoid has an approval rating of 67% based on 108 reviews, with an average rating of 6.50/10. The website's critics consensus reads, ""Anthropoid completes its mission rather unevenly but delivers a historically illuminating story with great performances to back it up."" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 59 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"". The film has garnered praise for its commitment to realism and true events.
In his review for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw wrote, ""An intelligent, tough, and gripping movie.""Variety's chief film critic Peter Debruge felt that ""Jamie Dornan and Cillian Murphy spearhead a mission to assassinate a top-ranking Nazi officer in a thriller that doesn't actually get thrilling until after the deed is done.""

The Age of Shadows,"The Age of Shadows (Korean: 밀정; lit. ""Emissary"") is a 2016 South Korean period action thriller film directed by Kim Jee-woon and written by Lee Ji-min and Park Jong-dae.

Korean police captain Lee Jung-chool (Song Kang-ho) has been charged by the Japanese colonial government with rooting out members of the country's resistance movement. But while Lee has a history of selling out his own people to secure a favorable position with the Japanese, he’s been hit harder than usual by the death of Kim Jang-ok (Park Hee-soon), a resistance fighter who used to be his classmate. The leader of the resistance, Che-san (Lee Byung-hun), senses that this turncoat, if approached and handled properly, might be turned once more — this time in their favor. And so begins an incremental, coded psychological dance between Lee and a key resistance figure named Kim Woo-jin (Gong Yoo), whose antique shop is a front for a scheme to smuggle explosives from Shanghai into Seoul.

Almost Friends (2016 film),"Almost Friends is a 2016 American comedy-drama film written and directed by Jake Goldberger. The film stars Freddie Highmore, Odeya Rush, Haley Joel Osment, Christopher Meloni, and Marg Helgenberger.
College drop out Charlie, who's moved back home, is struggling to discover who he really is as he deals with an irresponsible father and has a crush on Amber, a young woman who already has a boyfriend and is soon leaving for college.
The film premiered on October 14, 2016, at the Austin Film Festival. It was released in North America on November 17, 2017, by Gravitas Ventures and Orion Pictures.

Charlie Brenner is an unmotivated man who's returned home after dropping out of college. Living with his mother, stepfather Ross and brother Steven, he works at a small movie theatre and lives vicariously through his best friend Ben.
Charlie's life takes an unpredictable turn, however, when he finds himself falling for local coffee shop barista Amber. His friend Heather picks him up in the evening, and tries to convince him to join an upcoming party with their old high school classmates.
Amber isn't satisfied with her life. She has a mooching roommate, her cousin Jack, a track star boyfriend Brad and has steadfast plans to go to NYU in New York City in the fall.
Charlie and Heather head to the party. They share the elevator on the way up with Amber and Brad, where unbeknownst to Heather she loudly outs Charlie about his inability to ask out the barista he's almost stalking. Amber later approaches Charlie, but they talk only briefly before Brad convinces her to leave.
Then, Charlie's estranged father Howard unexpectedly re-enters his life, convincing him to let him stay. Against his mother's protests, Charlie lets Howard sleep in his room.
Although initially brushing Charlie off when he stops by the café, Amber later she suggests he walk with her the next day. They get to know each other, and he finds out she lives with Jack as her mom moved to Florida and she wanted to finish her senior year here, and she's been with Brad through most of high school.
Charlie gives Amber his number, and she ends up calling as she's got the upsetting news of being pregnant. Not wanting to be alone, she goes to his house for dinner. There Amber learns of Charlie's initial success with cooking, then his father and Ross end up arguing. After Charlie and Steven play around, she inexplicably gets upset.
Amber and Charlie go outside, and she tells him about taking a pregnancy test, although she lies about the result. She says it made her feel like her whole life flashed before her eyes.
At a party to celebrate Ben's passing the bar exam, Charlie is forced to use the ladies' room, where he overhears Amber telling her friend that she sees him as lost and could never see herself with him. Upset, he storms out.
Days pass, and as Amber hasn't heard from Charlie for a while, she shows up at his house. He lets her know he'd overheard her talking to her friend about him negatively. After they suddenly start making out, his father interrupts, so they go out to Steven's playhhouse. Charlie explains that a traumatic traffic accident he was involved in threw him off course after his junior year.
After Amber tells Charlie they can't be friends any more, he and Steven get lured out of the house by Howard, who clears the house of its furniture. Fired up with frustration, Charlie approaches Brad after track practice and challenges him to race. Brad inadvertently doubles over in pain.
Charlie ends up seeing Amber in the hospital, and explains he was being an asshole with Brad. Soon afterwards, Brad confronts her about Charlie and they break up.
In the meantime, Charlie drives down to a hotel in New Orleans his father had mentioned. Discovering most of the stolen furniture is in storage, Charlie gets the police involved and it is returned to his mother's. While there, Howard tells him two secrets he'd unearthed: Amber's abortion and Ben's passed bar confirmation.
Returning home, Charlie finally finds the path forward. He contacts a NYC chef who'd once shown an interest, getting an assistant chef position, then moves with Ben to the city as he knows who he wants to be.

In October 2017, Gravitas Ventures and Orion Pictures acquired distribution rights to the film, and set it for a November 17, 2017, release.

Almost Friends has grossed a total worldwide of $46,376, and sales of its DVD/Blu-ray releases have cashed $16,355.

On Rotten Tomatoes, Almost Friends has an approval rating of 29% based on seven reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10.
In a positive review, Marjorie Baumgarten of the Austin Chronicle wrote, ""[The film] has an easygoing charm that should earn it a solid place among the subset of movies about young people who emerge from their small-town cocoons and screw up their courage to take flight for the bright lights of New York City."" Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter described it less favorably as ""a comic drama that's sometimes appealingly gentle but more often frustratingly amorphous"" with ""instances of wit and sensitivity scattered through the screenplay, but they have no cumulative impact amid the lackluster direction and general dearth of urgency."" Upon the film's theatrical release, Katie Walsh of the Los Angeles Times called the film's premise of Highmore's character, Charlie, tenuously pursuing a relationship with Rush's Amber despite her existing relationship, ""painfully tone-deaf"" in light of the onset of Me Too movement, suggesting it ""feels like a relic of a bygone era, when movies could casually present stalking and coercion as acceptable forms of courtship.""

However, the seven-year itch starts with both of them focused on their respective careers. Their busy lifestyles and misunderstandings results in filing a divorce. A day before divorce, James meets with a freaky car accident. In the hospital, facing a coma James hallucinates/dreams St.Peter's presence and both of them review his life; his mistakes and the changes he could've done. Whether James realises his mistakes and is able to come back to his life forms the crux of the movie.

The filming began on 15 January 2016. Prithviraj and Vedhika previously acted together in Kaaviya Thalaivan (2014).
Movie shooting was wrapped on March 31, 2016.

Anil Johnson was signed in as the composer first. But he opted out before filming had begun. Music was composed by Gopi Sundar, and released on Muzik 247 label.

Initially James & Alice was scheduled to release on 29 April 2016, later postponed and released on 5 May 2016.

The Times of India gave 2.5 out of 5 stars stating ""The story arc of James and Alice is quite in sync with the analogy. Presented in a fragmented, flashback-heavy style, the movie is a simple portrait of a contemporary relationship, of a young family that is going through a rocky patch"".
Malayala Manorama gave 2.5 out of 5 stars stating ""An exceedingly slow-paced film, with less humour or other remarkable agents, James and Alice isn't everyone's cup of tea. The feather touch of something celestial keeps it engaging, but the magic, sadly wanes"".
IndiaGlitz gave 2.5 out of 5 stars stating ""Sujith Vasudev has done well for a directorial debut. There are certain elements that he will have to tweak to work for the larger audience. Gopi Sunder at the music section has done well yet again. The visually alluring frames need a special mention and the cinematographer has done well to give an artistic rendering to the tale"".

James & Alice DVD was released on Satyam Audios on 22 July 2016.

For the Love of Spock,"For the Love of Spock is a 2016 American documentary film about actor Leonard Nimoy produced by 455 Films and directed by his son Adam Nimoy, who started it before his father's death, at the age of 83, on February 27, 2015.
The documentary deals with the story of the character Spock, his impact in science fiction and popular culture, and the burden the character's fame imposed on Nimoy's personal and family life, from his son's point of view.

The film looks at the life and career of actor Leonard Nimoy, and his iconic character Mr. Spock. It includes interviews with cast, crew and people connected with Star Trek, fans at conventions, as well as personal memories.
As Odie Henderson from RogerEbert.com points out, ""'For the Love of Spock' is more than just catnip for Trekkies. It’s also an often painful examination of the rocky father/son relationship that existed between filmmaker Adam Nimoy and his famous father, Leonard.""

By Thanksgiving 2014, Adam Nimoy started working with his father in a documentary about Spock, to commemorate Star Trek: The Original Series’s 50th anniversary. After Leonard Nimoy's passing on February 27, 2015, the outpouring of affection from Star Trek fans prompted him to widen the film’s scope to encompass his father’s life and career beyond Spock.
To license Spock's still photographs and film clips from television and feature films in time to complete the documentary by 2016, Adam Nimoy launched a Kickstarter campaign in June 2015, aiming to collect US$600,000 in one month which attracted worldwide interest. By the end of the campaign, 9,439 backers pledged US$662,640, making it the most successful crowdfund of the period.
Production continued with interviews of William Shatner, George Takei, Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols, Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Simon Pegg, Zoe Saldana, Jim Parsons, Jason Alexander, Neil deGrasse Tyson and J. J. Abrams.
Adam Nimoy appeared as himself in ""The Spock Resonance"", the November 5, 2015, episode of the CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory, in which he interviewed Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons) for the documentary on his father, who made a voice cameo in the episode ""The Transporter Malfunction"" in the series' fifth season.
It had been stated that Quinto would provide narration for the documentary, but Adam Nimoy found that there were ""so many archival interviews and voice recordings"" that narration was not needed.
The documentary's first trailer was released April 13, 2016, and the theatrical trailer and poster on July 20.

A preliminary version of the film was screened on April 16, 2016, at the Tribeca Film Festival. It was followed by a panel composed of Adam Nimoy, Zachary Quinto, producer David Zappone, Access Hollywood and critic Scott Mantz, within Variety's Gordon Cox as moderator. The finished documentary's release was expected later in 2016.
On June 2, 2016, it was announced that the worldwide rights to the documentary had been acquired by Gravitas Ventures, and the film was scheduled for U.S. theatrical release and VOD day-and-date on September 9, one day after the 50th anniversary of the Original Series.
Since that date, the film has been available on iTunes, Vudu, Vimeo, several other TV providers, Netflix and Internet on Demand (national and international). It is also available as DVD and Blu-ray.

For the Love of Spock received universal acclaim from critics, and holds a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 30 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.34/10. Metacritic reports a score of 74/100 based on 8 critics, indicating ""Generally favorable reviews"".
Lance Ulanoff of Mashable said in his review that ""There's no way to fit 83 years into a rather fast-paced 100 minutes. As a consequence, huge swaths of Nimoy's life and career are mentioned all-too-briefly ... This doesn't diminish For the Love of Spock. Instead, it keeps the narrative more firmly focused on Spock himself, and Nimoy's emotional connection to his craft and those around him."" Frank Scheck in his review for The Hollywood Reporter said about the film, ""That actor Leonard Nimoy lived a rich and full life is made vividly clear in Adam Nimoy's loving documentary about his father and his most famous, iconic role."" Sarah Lewin of Space.com said that ""The documentary explores the fans' love both as a destabilizing force in Adam Nimoy's life and as a powerful statement of the character's universality. Indeed, besides Spock and Nimoy himself, the fans are the third main character in the film.""

For the Love of Spock won the Audience Award for Best Documentary at 2016 Fantasia International Film Festival.
