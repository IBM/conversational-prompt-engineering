text"WHY WE SHOULD ALL CARE ABOUT WORLD BANK REFORM -- While never attracting the same round-the-clock media scrutiny or enormous crowds as UN COP climate conferences, the World Bank's biannual meetings with the International Monetary Fund have fast become two of the most critical weeks on the calendar in determining how far and fast we go in confronting climate change.  After all, in the race to halve greenhouse gases emissions this decade and head off catastrophic warming, we succeed or fail together. The atmosphere is notably agnostic as to whether emissions come from Peoria or Pretoria. When it comes to arresting or accelerating the steady uptick in temperatures, only the total volume matters. Of course, today, the world is massively off track in reducing emissions fast enough to meet this goal. Some wealthy nations are beginning to make progress (albeit not enough) in shifting their economies away from fossil fuels. But unless the Global South nations that account for roughly 40% of global GDP and 85% of the world's population and emissions from India and Africa now projected to grow for some time– are part of this energy transition too, our chances of reaching the Paris Agreement stretch goal of 1.5 degrees are a longshot at best. So how does this change? As a 2023 UN report highlights, the key lies in providing access to affordable finance, enabling Global South countries to develop with clean energy technologies that – unlike fossil fuels – can bring power to millions today without threatening their lives and our planet tomorrow. Which is where the World Bank comes in.  A POWERFUL INSTITUTION WITH A LOVE FOR FOSSIL FUELS - Historically, when climate advocates talked about multilateral development banks (MDBs) like the World Bank, it was not as a force for progress. As a new report from Oil Change International underscores, MDBs have a huge role in shaping energy investments in recipient countries, providing grants and accessible finance that not only support projects directly but de-risk them for private investors. As both the biggest MDB (by 2023 lending data) and one of the biggest creditors on the planet, the World Bank stands above all other MDBs with extraordinary influence in shaping the direction of energy choices around the world – and particularly in the Global South. For many years, these choices have been largely pushing the planet toward a hotter and hotter future. From 2020–2022, the World Bank Group (WBG) was the largest direct funder of fossil fuels among multilateral development banks, providing on average $1.2 billion in financing each year. Plus, despite being the biggest source for climate-related development finance, the bank's real world track record on climate is mixed at best. Recent reporting showed that hundreds of nominally climate-related projects receiving WBG funding have no real connection to, well, actual climate purposes. Then, of course, there was David Malpass, the bank's previous president, who refused to publicly acknowledge the simple fact that fossil fuels are driving climate change, saying, ""I am not a scientist."" The bank has made significant progress under its new president, Ajay Banga (more on that below), but if the bank is serious about its mission to ""end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity on a livable planet,"" it has to completely change course. Fast. The world's scientists are crystal clear on the need to halve emissions by 2030. With its funding decisions effectively driving energy policy for countries across the Global South, the bank will have an outsize role in determining whether we meet this goal or not.  A CRITICAL WINDOW FOR ENERGY INVESTMENT - The clock is ticking for the World Bank in more ways than one. Power plants can run for 30–50 years in order to recoup the billions invested in them, with the result that building new coal, gas, or oil infrastructure can lock in emissions for decades. The Global South needs lots of electricity to develop – and it needs it fast. The urgent challenge for the bank is to ensure countries have access to affordable finance to enable them to build the massive renewable infrastructure necessary to meet these needs without fossil fuels. The stakes are enormous and the window for action is short. As POLITICO reports, former USAID administrator and current Rockefeller Foundation President Raj Shah told reporters that, ""without cheaper access to finance, coal and diesel are projected to supply energy for the nearly 3.5 billion people today who consume less than 1,000 kilowatt-hours of power annually. 'If we don't make the changes now, in two decades, we lose the fight on climate. Period,' said Shah."" A new report from the Potsdam Institute puts numbers to what losing the fight means. The authors project that the impacts of climate change will already cost some 19% of per-capita income by 2050. Which equates to a staggering $38 trillion each year, or more than double the EU's GDP.  As with so much of the climate crisis, these costs will be highly unequal, hitting the Global South hardest of all, with the authors noting, ""The largest losses are committed at lower latitudes in regions with lower cumulative historical emissions and lower present-day income."" What the report also makes clear is these costs could get much, much higher, should the world keep burning fossil fuels. But, critically, the costs we face from inaction are an estimated six times higher than the costs of the global energy transition necessary to meet Paris Agreement goals.  Which brings us back to the World Bank and the urgent need for finance to catalyze exactly this level of action.  To his credit, the bank's new president, Ajay Banga has made climate a core focus since taking the role last June, committing to dedicate 45% of the bank's annual financing to climate projects. To help overcome the real limits of bank resources compared to the scale of the climate challenge – as he recently told reporters, ""I don't have infinite money"" – he's also worked to stretch balance sheets by working to attracted private investors and increase the capital available to for climate projects. FOUR KEY STEPS FORWARD - The bank's progress under Banga is heartening, but with the pace of warming leaving scientists simply slack-jawed, the institution needs to move faster and more boldly than perhaps any time in its recent history. Effecting policy change on a scale equal to the climate challenge at a massive institution is admittedly a big ask. But four key reforms can help the bank realize its full potential as a powerful force for change and help speed a just transition to clean energy worldwide. 1. Stop funding all fossil fuels. As the line goes, the first rule of being in a hole is to stop digging. Despite saying the right things about climate in public, the WBG has poured billions into fossil fuel projects worldwide in recent years, both in direct and indirect financing.  The bank's own research shows climate change could push up to 132 million people into extreme poverty this decade. If WBG is serious about its mission, it has to end all funding for any aspects of fossil fuel projects. A good place to start would be adding any fossil fuel-related expenditures to the list of prohibited items in all legally binding agreements with borrowers. 2. Dedicate at least 50% of total annual financing to climate projects and expand fair and accessible credit for climate vulnerable nations. Ending new fossil developments is only the first step. The bank has an equally critical role in creating better development paths for Global South nations, powered by clean energy. With many nations making investments now that will lock them into emissions-heavy or renewable pathways for decades to come, the bank needs to allocate resources accordingly and increase funding for climate projects to support energy transition at this critical moment. Many Global South nations have signaled support for clean energy initiatives but struggled to access financing at the same fair rates wealthy nations enjoy. What the World Bank in particular can do is both provide accessible financing and help de-risk clean energy projects for private investors. 3. Commit to funding the International Development Association (IDA) at levels that align with a 1.5 degrees pathway. The bank's IDA has become one of the world's primary vehicles for getting much-needed financing to climate vulnerable nations to respond to the increasing droughts, rising seas, and storms unleashed by rising temperatures. As warming continues, IDA faces two inseparable challenges. The first is enabling vulnerable nations to transition quickly and boldly enough to help keep the world on course to 1.5 degrees. The second is supporting them in adapting to impacts growing more severe with every fraction of a degree.  IDA's effectiveness here depends in no small part on its funding, which is replenished by donors through regular cycles. To enable vulnerable countries to transition quickly enough and survive cascading climate impacts even at 1.5 degrees of warming, experts now say IDA funding must reach $279 billion by its 22nd replenishment in 2031. Assuming the WBG is successful here, the priority will be to get this funding out quickly and primarily through grants and highly concessional loans that do not plunge borrowers – many of which already face crippling debt payments – further into unsustainable debt. 4. Ensure the WBG actively works to identify unintended negative impacts of funded projects. One of the biggest challenges facing the bank today is its own long legacy of advancing projects that displace communities and devastate local ecosystems. Reversing this pattern and creating effective paths for local communities to address any harms will be critical to building goodwill and ensuring long-term success. A good place to start is developing independent complaints mechanisms to proactively identify potential impacts early on and remedy them through people-centered redress frameworks.  IT'S TIME FOR THE WORLD BANK TO SEIZE THE MOMENT - Not everyone gets a second chance at redemption. But that's exactly what the WBG has now and with the four reforms above, it can become a major catalyst for just energy transition and climate action on a global scale. This is admittedly easier said than done. Today, climate change joins multiple wars and elections worldwide on a long list of as factors leading countries to adjust priorities and tighten their purse strings. But this is the critical chance we have – and it's time for the WBG to seize it.""ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENDERS IN THE AMAZON -- The Amazon Rainforest, spanning over 6.7 million square kilometers (about twice the area of India), is a critical global ecosystem of unparalleled biodiversity and climate stabilization. “Not only does the Amazon encompass the single largest remaining tropical rainforests in the world, it also houses at least 10% of the world’s known biodiversity, including endemic and endangered flora and fauna, and its river accounts for 15-16% of the world’s total river discharge into the oceans,” according to WWF. However, this natural treasure faces relentless threats from extractive industries, leading to a profound crisis for environmental and human rights defenders across Latin America. As discussed in the Escazu Agreement, Indigenous leaders serve as frontline defenders of human rights, protecting the environment and promoting sustainable development in their communities. Despite their efforts, they face systemic aggression and violence from Amazonian governments, worsening existing injustices and institutional failures. Yet, their comprehensive approach and long-term vision offer invaluable alternatives to address the socio-economic and environmental challenges facing the region. In recent years, Latin America has seen a surge in violence against environmental and human rights defenders, with the Amazon being particularly susceptible. According to Global Witness in 2023, 88% of killings on defenders in 2022 were in Latin America, and 36% of all defenders killed were Indigenous peoples. These attacks, often linked to resource exploitation and infrastructure projects disproportionately target Indigenous leaders and activists, worsening socio-environmental conflicts and perpetuating cycles of violence. Indigenous women stand at the intersection of environmental defense, cultural preservation, and social justice. Their relationship with the land is deeply rooted in ancestral ties, where the territory serves as the foundation of their existence. They defend the land not only for its ecological significance but also for its role in ensuring food security, safeguarding health, protecting our climate, preserving culture, and nurturing spiritual connections. One exemplary group embodying the resilience and determination of Indigenous people is the collective known as ""Mujeres Amazónicas (Amazonian Women).""  Comprising over 100 women, who are mainly Indigenous, from diverse nationalities in the Ecuadorian Amazon, these women have been at the forefront of environmental activism and cultural preservation. Their journey began amidst the Indigenous uprisings of the 1990s, where they saw the courage of their parents and communities in demanding recognition of their rights. The collective of Amazonian women is diverse, including leaders, environmental and human rights defenders, activists, and more, standing up for various Indigenous peoples and nationalities of the Amazon. Each of them navigates unique realities in their daily lives, yet they are bound by a shared commitment to defend their lands and communities. They are united by a common purpose: to uphold the basic human right to a healthy environment. Many start with smaller actions, championing local causes within their communities, before rising to leadership roles in social organizations and Indigenous councils. Despite facing many obstacles, hundreds of Indigenous women made a pivotal decision to step out of their traditional roles and amplify their voices. In 2018, the collective marched to Puyoon International Women's Day, and several days later a group spent several days in Quito, the capital of Ecuador, calling on the president to listen to their proposals. This was an act of bravery and determination, demanding to be heard and respected. Once in the capital, they shared with the government the Mandate from Amazonian Women Grassroots Defenders of the Rainforest Against the Extractive Economic Model – a declaration where Amazonian women reject extractive industry in their territories, as well as the end of gender violence against Indigenous women. With the support of Amnesty International and Amazon Watch, they shared “over 250,000 signatures to the General Attorney of Ecuador, demanding an ‘effective’ investigation due to recent attacks and threats against women defenders of the Amazon, as well as the end of state concessions to oil, logging, and mining companies in our territories.” However, their calls for action were met with insufficient attention and indifference from authorities, hindering their fight for environmental justice and human rights, which has been further complicated by corruption, pollution, and governmental apathy. The formation of organizations such as the Association of Waorani Women of the Ecuadorian Amazon (AMWAE) and the Amazonian Women's Collective have been instrumental in the defense of the Amazon. These groups are a rebellion against oppression and exploitation, uniting women in the struggle for a sustainable and fair future for their communities. Through their leadership and resistance, these women are challenging historical injustices and forging a path towards environmental and social justice. Their ability to organize and mobilize, both locally and internationally, serves as a powerful tool for demanding respect for their rights and protecting the legacy of the Amazon for future generations. It is crucial to recognize and support the efforts of Amazonian women in their fight for justice and dignity. Their voices and visions are indispensable for ensuring a sustainable and fair future for all, where the Amazon and its inhabitants can thrive in harmony with nature. Alicia Cahuiya, a Waorani leader and founder and president of the AMWAE, is a prime example of the resilience and determination of Amazonian women. Cahuiya experienced firsthand the intimidation and violence perpetrated by her husband and other men in her community, fueled by the influx of extractive industries like oil companies. This prompted Cahuiya and other Indigenous women to seek support and ask what they could do to stop this? The men in their community worked, but the earnings were often diverted elsewhere, leaving families like Cahuiya’s unable to guarantee food security, access to health care, or other basic rights. In response, she and other Waorani women who shared similar experiences began organizing. Cahuiya founded a group crafting souvenirs to sell to improve the economic stability of women in her community. Indigenous communities, like Cahuiya’s Waorani population, once had everything they needed to thrive in the rainforest, from food to medicine to recreation. However, the arrival of the oil industry disrupted this dynamic, contaminating the land and water and making it impossible for them to farm or cultivate food. As a result, they were forced into a capitalist way of life to buy first-needed products due to the contamination and loss of access to natural resources. For the people in the Amazon, this leads to a precarious way of life, as an estimated 36% of Amazonian populations live in poverty. Driven by the necessity to seek income, Indigenous communities are increasingly displaced and become climate refugees due to environmental degradation and pollution caused by extractive industries. For decades, there has been a significant displacement process among Indigenous peoples in the Amazon, often caused by deforestation and extractive activities that result in the loss of their ancestral lands and violence. In response to these challenges, Cahuiya and many other Indigenous women organize against oil extraction in the Amazon Rainforest, hoping to ensure that their children experience the rainforest in its best condition. Their political organization is not about creating a name for themselves – it is about recognizing themselves as political subjects, realizing their voices' value, and demanding that the government consider them. Thus, they embark on a local and international struggle, confronting reports warning of the Amazon's decline, potentially turning it into a savanna in the future. Moreover, they are concerned about reports indicating that the rainforest may cease to exist as it's known today by 2025 due to continued deforestation. This underscores how the current economic development model in Ecuador is at odds with life, the environment, and humanity. Therefore, it is crucial for Amazonian women, alongside the rest of the population, to organize politically not only to assert their rights or raise their voices but also to demand that governments guarantee basic rights like access to water, food security, or education. This is an undeclared war, without weapons, that women wage from their territories, marked by casualties and enormous losses, yet often overlooked by broader society.""PROTECTING LEBANON’S SACRED QADISHA VALLEY -- Nestled within the rugged mountains of Lebanon lies the awe-inspiring Qadisha Valley. This UNESCO World Heritage site embraces visitors with its mystical aura, where towering cedar trees and ancient monasteries stand in harmonious union.
