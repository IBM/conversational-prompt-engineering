text,summary"My [23M] GF [22F] is a bit too active on my Instagram for my comfort level.
We've been together a few months now and things are going swell. We're some 150 miles apart (she works, I'm in grad school). We see each other every or every other weekend depending on how busy we are and it's good so far.

One small hiccup: our presence on social media. By nature I'm a pretty private person and keep a small group of friends. I only share relevant stuff with my close friends and I am not prone to advertise my life, I think its a bit frivolous. Yes I have a Facebook, Twitter, and IG but I use that to keep a tab on what's going on in the world but just so I'm aware and in the loop. 

She's a bit of the opposite.

We've recently become followers of each other on Instagram (IG is shorter for my convenience) and we both have browsed through each other's IG's to look at old pics as I'm sure everyone does. Little comments here and there, the usual.

BUT this is where my problem begins. I have some family/friends on IG but as I said, not everyone I care to advertise my relationship(s) to in general because it's called a personal life. Some of her comments are pretty G/PG but quite a number are saucy and flirtatious (PG13/R). I'd rather she not post such things on my IG but I don' t know how to tell her without sounding like an asshole. I've begun to field questions from people I don't care enough to share about my personal life and it's kinda annoying to be honest.

What's the best way to tread this delicately but not come across as an asshole?
",GF's comments on IG are a bit too much for my personal comfort. How do I tell her to be mindful?"Where to go for our 2nd date, and after how many dates should I [21M] make a move on her [18F]?
I did a search on the topic but was unable to find anything relevant, so here goes.

We'll soon be going on our first date. Nothing fancy, I'll buy her coffee and we'll sit down and talk to get to know each other.

I've been in one longterm relationship before, but my experiences with dating is almost at a zero. Therefore I'm in desperate need for advice on where we should go for our second date, and when I should make a move on her.

I'm pretty sure it should just stay with the smiling and hugging at the first date, but should I try to hold her hand on the second or even try to kiss her? I know it all depend on the mood, set and setting etc., but some of my friends told me not to wait too long to make the first move, otherwise I could lose her interest.

Now I might have an advantage. When we randomly met in public not so long ago, we got to talk about a dessert I was preparing for my family. She told me that I should make it for her someday, and I agreed to.

So if I tell her after our first date that I think we should meet again, she might propose the idea of coming over to my place so I could make the dessert for her. If so, that would be our second date.

And I have some kind of feeling that I should definitely make a move on her, if we are at my place. But I'm in no personal need to do so, I'm just fine by taking it slow. It's just that I really know jack shit about dating and reading girls to be honest with you.

Any help would be very much appreciated, and I thank you all in advance.

Should I definitely make a move, if my date comes to my place, if yes, what move should I make?*""I have some emotional scars from my childhood that sometimes affect my personal and social lives.  I have never sought after professional help. Can we open up a conversation on this topic and what I should do to combat this?
Backstory: My parents divorced when I was too young to even remember them being together. My mother remarried not long after that and is currently still with my step father. From a pretty young age, around 10 probably, I became terrified of my step father. 

He had an extremely short temper and was the type of person that would get in your face and raise his voice for the smallest of offenses. He would also play these games (I saw them as games) where he would get in your face, threaten you with whatever punishment, and then say that we weren't to speak. Then, he would ask if you understood what he was saying. If you said yes, he would yell at you for speaking. If you didn't say anything, he would yell at you for not responding.  

Besides spankings now and then and a face slap a couple of times, he really wasn't all that physically violent. But, as you can imagine, a lot of what he did was emotionally damaging to me. 

I've always been a quiet, introverted person and I've never figured out if this is my personality or I have been shut up so many times by my step father that this is how I am. I have mild social anxiety, sometimes worse than others, am very sensitive and have trouble expressing myself.  I generally see myself as a gentle person but some things set me off and I feel this intense building rage, just like I witnessed very often from my step father, and it really scares me (I have only told 2 people this ever but I have recurring dreams of violently fighting my stepfather, less frequently now that I am older). I don't want to be that type of person to my wife or my children. What should I do to help this situation?
",I had a childhood filled with a lot of anxiety because of my troubled relationship with my step father and I think that problems in my personal and social lives are feeling some consequences. What can I do to help this situation?"Stepmom of two, 7 and 8. They call me by my first name and I don't have a problem with this, but recently have been reconsidering.
When I was first introduced to the kids, it wasn't with the intent of marrying their dad and becoming a permanent part of their lives.  They called all of their dad's friends by their first names, so that's how I was introduced to them as well.  When we did get married several years later, it seemed kind of silly to ask them to change.  That's the name they know me by, and they have never been disrespectful with it in any way.  

In addition, they already have a Mama, and I would never dream of trying to ""usurp"" her role by forcing them to use a Mom title on me - but they do know that I am their stepmom, and they are content with that.  

Recently, my stepdaughter has been trying to give me a nickname... a variation on my first name.  She is doing it to establish a term of endearment, not to try to be disrespectful.  However, it makes me feel a little uncomfortable.  I have never been a nickname person - I used to throw fits as a child when my sister would use nicknames on me - and it just feels weird.  Like she's trying to see me as a friend rather than a parent.  It has actually made me question if I do need to go by a title rather than my name.  Or, do I just need to tell her in no uncertain terms that she should use my proper name?

Just over a week ago my girlfriend kissed her ex-boyfriend, after a week of us trying to put it aside more and more kept coming out about the relationship until she said that she had no feelings left for me, but she would be sure they could come back. 

Up until this point she has spent the week being very upset about the whole situation, crying at the thought of the relationship ending and telling me i'm the only one for her. We had long term plans together.

However, because she said she had no feelings for me, I ended the relationship, I deleted her and then texted her to ask her a question after I had done it, and found out she is yet again at her ex boyfriends less that 24 hours after the relationship.

This is our first real relationship, we lost our virginity to each other and we done everything together. She was perfect for me, I'm slightly introverted but like to go out on occasion. Finding a girl like this was a very small chance for me, and i'm scared I won't find a girl like her ever again. I'm just not sure how I'm going to get over this. Does anyone have any advice?

We were talking about summer classes, which are notoriously hard. I was talking about how I can't do 12 hours next summer (2 classes in each mini semester) because they are hard. She had taken one summer class for her major (art, it was a upper level drawing class) and said summer classes are a breeze. I said my classes ( upper level business and management) will have more material to cover and that I've heard on every account that summer classes are not a breeze. She then said that I think my classes are harder to which I replied that there is more material to cover basically claiming that yes, they are harder. She is saying that she has worked very hard! I am very aware of that. I told her that I'm sorry for thinking her class was easier, that I don't think her degree is easier, and that I'm sorry if it came off like that.

She is upset with me and thinks that I don't think she works as hard and is taking an easy major. That I hold my self higher. I don't think any of this, I didn't put too much thought in what I was saying. 

What do I tell her to make her trust that I do in fact know she works just as hard as me?

Well,  a close female friend of mine went to a nice dinner with her boss. She is 23 years old, he is around 40 or so. No, she is a paid intern at a company, and it is not unusual nor completely unexpected for bosses to take their employees out for dinners and lunches as a reward for work well done, or, in this case as a pre holiday break celebration for the end of the year. 

now, my friend went to a nice dinner with her boss, and everything seem professional to find. However, at the end of the dinner, the boss mentioned to her that he does not get to have much fun, and that they should do it again. He then kissed her on the cheek. He also sent her a text after the date saying, that he had a good time and that they should do it again.

Unprofessional or...? The girl in question was a little weirded out, I might add. 

Just curious on thoughts of potential unprofessional behavior...

Yes, I did it. I fucked up, big time. I'm 21 male, my girlfriend is 22. We have been dating for over two years and I fucked up so bad. I was talking to another girl that I almost dated instead of my current girlfriend. (I guess I felt like I wanted to see if I made the choice of picking the right girl?) I have been talking to her since July on facebook saying stupid shit that would hurt me if I read my girlfriend said to another guy. Just stupid shit like I wonder if I made the right choice? Oh how's your sex life. Just disgusting stuff I should of never asked. But like I said, I think I was just trying to see if I made the right choice in picking my girl. I know I made the right choice, but I feel so bad because my girlfriend found everything and is completely devastated. She is still my girlfriend though. She still loves me. It's only been about 3 weeks since she found out. She is telling me she is feeling different though, and her love for me might be changing, she's unsure. I wanna prove to her so bad that I wanna be with her. I seriously know this is the biggest mistake of my life, and I need to win her back. How can I do this?

We're 19 and we've dated for almost 4 years..

Today is this huge St. Paddy's day parade, right? And while I'm at work slaving my butt off he wants to go to this huge field that all the teenagers go to and get trashed, whatever. As long as he behaves himself. 

But the problem lies in that he's lied a lot in the past and has acted sketchy so I don't trust him as much as I should. I gave him a simple ""Hey, don't do this or that or your going to ruin your last chance with me."" And he said ""Well might as well leave me now because I know as soon as you see a picture of me with a female friend you're going to flip out.."" I told him it would be fine as long as it wasn't all gropey.. like you know a normal friend picture, arm around the shoulder face's touching is fine but I don't want to see his hand virtually on their ass or anything like that. Am I being ridiculous? 

And then I remembered something: A while back we were together doing something and I wanted to take a picture together, he refused and got all nervous. And then I realized this has happened before. Sketchy much?.. I decided to test something out, I put every old picture I had of us on facebook and tagged it. It was only 3 so it's not like I spammed his notifications or anything crazy like that. He immediately deleted me off facebook, a cheap way to break up I must say.

Needless to say I am wicked heart broken, hurt, I don't know what to do with myself. I know he was pretty shitty but this was a long time spend with someone. I wasn't trying to be psychotic I was merely standing up for myself because he was being sketchy. I'm crushed.. 

It doesn't help that this is spring break and all of my friends from university are far away, and all my friends from here AREN'T on spring break so so are they.. 
I have two concert tickets for two seperate events and no one to go with..

And that

About a month ago, I met someone through an online dating site. After the third date, she told me she had recently broken up with her long-term ex and wasn't ready for another relationship yet. I told her that I'm fine taking things slow, and things progress from there. Currently we're in a slightly nebulous fwb relationship. She gets extremely upset by any hint that we are seeing each other or dating, but I'm comfortable keeping things casual.

The problem is that while she wants to avoid calling it a relationship, she keeps trying to make it one. At first we would simply grab dinner once a week, watch tv, have sex and go our separate ways. Now she's wanting to get together almost every night. She's texting me constantly. At least five times during the day, to the point where my boss has noticed and commented on it. Long conversations every night. After she had been to my place a few times, she asked to spend the night. Last night at 9 pm, she said she was having a bad day and asked if she could sleep at my place. All these are steps that I don't take until I'm in a serious relationship.

I know that she recently decided to break up with her long-term SO, and is having a hard time getting over it, although I don't know any details. I want to help and be supportive, but I worry that I'm making things worse. Any time she hears from her ex or is feeling depressed, she clings to me to fill an emotional void, and I'm worried that this will keep her from moving on.  I like her a lot, and want to help her through this, but I cannot imagine this is healty. I'm not sure of the best way to proceed without hurting her further.

We've been together 4 years. I had two miscarriages and have been trying to conceive, now not getting pregnant at all since my second loss. I literally cannot keep seeing my friends on social media, specifically Facebook, get pregnant every week. It breaks me down. It makes me feel insecure, that I'm not a real woman, jealous, that something is wrong with me. I feel like a monster. 

Hiding these people wouldnt work as a new one pops up and I just want a break. I asked him if he would temporarily (maybe permanently) deactivate Facebook with me. He's on it a lot and would tell me updates or ill see his page now and then when he's on our shared computer. He doesn't understand how much it would help me even after I explained it. I'm starting to get frustrated with it. 

Am I asking too much? How can we compromise?

This is **not** a question about whether or not we should. We're still discussing it.

This is a question about the time and money costs of dating as a man in an open relationship.

When I was single, it was a lot of work and a lot of money. I spent hours and hours on dating sites looking at profiles. Then there were the nights out meeting people, weekends playing kickball, etc. I took a dozen women out on dates over a couple of years and ending up spending hundreds of dollars on food and activities.

As a man in an open relationship will it take more time or less time to find dates? Will it take more money or less money?

Like the title says, I believe I am jealous of my girlfriend. She grew up right outside a small city, enjoyed the nightlife (drinking age is 18 where she grew up), the dating life, summer weekends at a lake cabin, great vacations, and a large group of good friends that she went to a lot of house parties with. I grew up in a quiet suburb, slow to make friends, hardly went out even after turning 21 (drinking age where I grew up) at university. She is only my third girlfriend, but the first serious one. She has been in love before and been with several other guys intimately. I have only been with two girls previously, and they were short lived.

We have been talking about getting more serious in our relationship and she is ready to settle down, she told me. I know that is what I want as well, but I am having trouble with a couple things. Regardless of whether or not I settle down with her, I need to accept that I will never be able to go back and relive my adolescence. Somehow I need to accept that. I cannot find a way. Secondly, staying with her means a constant reminder of something I want, but can't have. There must be some way to get passed this.

EDIT* sorry guys, new to this subreddit. [17/M]
","gf of 2 months wants to take a break because shes felt that she hasnt been committed to this relationship at all, i feel like its going to end""Did I [23 M] make the right choice by ending things with my girlfriend [23 M/F]? Lots of history.
Back story: this is a girl I was introduced to by her aunt whom I was close friends with nearly 7 years ago. She was seeing someone at the time, but we started becoming intimate once their relationship ended. There was no overlap to my knowledge. 

We weren't the most solid couple, being so young, but we developed a strong bond from an early-ish age. It became toxic towards the end. 

Two years later, a mutual friend encourages us to start talking again, and we hit if off. We gave it some time and decided to give the relationship another shot and we lasted about 6 months. 

I had graduated with an engineering degree with lots of recognitions and job offers. She was in exactly the same place; dropped out after a few part time classes not any closer to a career. Spent her free time watching reality TV shows like the Kardashians and not really doing anything with her life. I could work with her credit card debt, and other personal issues. What constantly bothered me was she could never stimulate me in an intellectual way. Conversations felt incredibly repetitive until we just sort of stopped talking. I could only deal with the silent treatment for 2 weeks before I ended things.

The caviet is we still love eachother, but it's hard to picture spending my life with her. She always talked about wanting a ring/baby, which sounded nice til I thought about the logistics of everything. I guess what I'm just looking for is just to make sure I ended things for the right reasons. Was I being selfish or expecting too much for being 23 years old? Not everyone has their life figured out at 23, but she didn't even have a plan. I did not want to be sugar daddy.
",I ended my relationship because GF couldnt not challenge me in an intellectual way. Broke up with her. Was I being selfish?"I [M/21] met someone [M/21] online. We got along pretty well when we met. Sending me mixed signals now.
Hi everyone! I'm in need of a bit of advice. I don't really have anyone I can to about this, because I'm not really out (I'm bisexual) to anyone but myself. 

I met this guy online about 3 weeks ago. We migrated to texting and agreed to meet for a few drinks after he got off work one night. I thought it went pretty well. His profile said he was shy and he was definitely shy. But I think overall we enjoyed each other's company. We didn't text for a few days and so I sent him a four or five sentence text about how I liked him and if he didn't like me that that's completely ok and that he should tell me without being afraid of hurting my feelings. He took very kindly to that and told me he thought I was a really nice guy and would like to see where things go with us. That made me feel better.

We texted on and off a few times during the week. This past Friday I asked him if he'd like have dinner with me on Saturday. He apologized and he said that he would but that he already had plans with a friend he hadn't seen in a while. I said that was fine and not to worry about it and that he should have fun with his friend. I asked him a few hours later if he was busy that night. I apologized for the short notice and that I understood if he already had plans, but he told me that he was working. 

After that, I felt kind of embarrassed that I may have been too forward or too pushy and so I texted him apologizing if I made him feel that way and that it wasn't my intention at all. That was last night (Monday) and he still hasn't texted me back. =\

I'm just not understanding what I'm doing wrong. He clearly expressed that he was interested in getting to know me more, but he often seems aloof or distant and not very talkative. I don't know if that's just his personality, he really wasn't into me even though he said he was, or if he's just playing hard to get or something. 

Any advice or input is appreciated. Thanks!

So here goes my story. Thanks in advance for reading through. 
So my SO and I have had some rough times but nothing like this. We are both in college at the same school where we met and last summer I went away for a medical program for 6 weeks. In that time we had a lot of fights and you can say we weren't really together. I was still completely committed to her though in my heart and mind and I assumed she was too. I figured when I came back we could work on things in person, but attempting to do so long distance was pointless. 
Well. I was right. I came back and we started to talk things out and hang out again and everything turned out great. Except I found out that she slept with someone during that time when I was away from home who had the same name as me who she hasn't talked to since high school. That really... Affected me. 
I'm not supporting a double standard or being misogynistic or anything. Ignore my age because I'm very emotionally and intellectually mature. But I just cant understand how she could do that. She claimed to still love me and we always said how we would always come back to each other. But if that's true, why would she have sex with someone on a whim like that?! She said it was him and her and her friend watching a movie and ""it just happened."" This was like 2 weeks after I left. 
I don't know what I'm looking for. I guess you can't say she cheated but to me she did. Either way it just really hurts and when I'm with her now I feel happy but the thought keeps coming up and it's definitely affecting us. I just need some advice on how to deal with this. Will things ever go back to normal? Will I ever be able to look at her with respect and love again? Or will I always see her I'm this lust-like way where she can't go without sex for more than a month?

Hi Reddit, this is a pretty small problem in the grand scheme of things, but any advice is still appreciated!

Alex and I have been together for 3 wonderful months. We had the same friend group in university but only grew close after graduation, and started dating a few months ago. Everything has been smooth sailing except for the fact that his aroma is so strong that it clings to everything he touches. If I leave a sweater at his apartment it'll come back reeking of Acqua di whatever. My bedsheets smell like cologne. I smell like cologne after we hang out. It's driving me insane. I don't think I'm particularly sensitive to scents, as other people have been pointing this out too.

It's bizarre because I can't remember him smelling particularly strongly before - we used to only hang out in group settings at parties so maybe that dissipated it a bit? But since we started getting closer it's been getting noxious.

I was over at his apartment once before date night and he was getting ready, and I witnessed him put on 7 sprays of cologne. He misted it in the air and walked through it, and also did a few sprays in the bathroom after his shower the next morning (nooooo). The scent on his body eventually fades out (or maybe I just get used to it?) but freshly applied it is very hard to get close to him. I've tried mentioning it to him gently a few times and he also looks confused and says that he hasn't noticed it smelling too strongly, but then he does it again the next time!

Help me! How do I bring this up without sounding like a bitch? He does smell quite nice once the scent has finished punching me in the face, but I'm not sure if I can live like this much longer.

My gf and I have been together for half a year and are in college together. Our relationship has been going fine until her ex started to text her 24/7 (he already texts her somewhat)  and she is always on her phone. I have reason to believe that he is trying to get with her. Here's the background:

Before me, my gf dated her ex for a couple months. However, he had to move so they broke up. After their breakup, he still talks to her regularly, which is fine. However, my gf admitted to me that he hasn't quite moved on yet and she took his virginity. In addition he wants to fly out to her town to meet her. (which might or might not happen). He keeps contacting her through fb, text, Skype, etc. 

My gf has realized that this made me uncomfortable and stated that he is just a friend now. She also stated that she would never give up on friends for our relationship. She also said she cared for both of us. And she seems to enjoy talking to him from my perspective. So what do I do? Or am I just jealous? Help please and thanks :)

My ex-SO and I broke up because she wanted time to 'be alone'. We planned on being friends, but that quickly dissolved when she began constantly talking about, texting at all hours, and hanging out with the trainer from her gym daily. He's been into her for months.

Anyway, she moved out of our condo last week (took the cat..), and I'm only here until the lease is up in December. I'm likely moving all my stuff out Dec 1st. I planned on going NC with her indefinitely, but there are a few things:

When she moved out, she took the mail-key. She plans on being back later in December to tidy the place up before we hand back the keys (separately, I hope), and she offered to pay me for some of my possessions that she wanted to take.

It's been a week, and I'm wondering if I'm just looking for excuses to break the NC. Should I e-mail her about the stuff and ask her to come by while I'm out to leave the stuff?

Basically, I'm 17 years old, and throughout my whole life I've never been interested in one-night stands or hooking up or having a fling. I've always wanted a serious relationship and anything outside that doesn't really interest me. Don't get me wrong, I can see girls and find them hot and (as any 17 year old boy would) think about doing stuff with girls just for fun.

But in reality it's not at all what I want. I want a serious relationship. I only really find interest in girls I think MIGHT be future spouses. If I ever meet a great girl, but I know I won't be able to marry her, I lose interest.

Because of this I've never even kissed a girl (because I'm too picky, really), but that doesn't bother me all that much. What worries me is if this is going to affect my life. Is it wrong of me to only want a relationship with a future?

While everyone is out ""taking advantage of their youth"", I find no interest in that. All my friends do it, but I find it too immature and pointless. I'm not interested in it. I'm only interested in a real relationship. *And the big problem is I don't know any girls my age that share that interest, so it's hard to find anyone.* Should I do anything about it?

There's absolutely nothing romantic between us at all. She and I know each other through the campus theatre group. She is currently planning on living on campus with other girls, and I mentioned we should look at getting a two bedroom apartment since it's cheaper and allows for more indepedence. She agreed, and talked to her mom about it, who was fine. They're both worried that her dad will say no, since I'm a guy and she's a girl.

Her mom is going to talk to her dad about it tomorrow, and I'm wondering if there's anything worth mentioning that might help soften the blow. It's necessary that we have his approval, since they help pay for her school. I've mentioned that I'd be more than willing to talk to him and address any concerns he may have. The place we'd likely be getting is just off campus, and isn't any less safe than living on campus would be.

So here's what happened, on 7/27 my car was parked in the parking lot at my apartment building. That night the car next to mine caught on fire from what is believed to be electrical problems and later had a small explosion. During this incident my car sustained fire damage including a partially melted front bumper, blinker, cowl, tire damage and other smaller things. Both me and the other party contacted our insurance companies that night to report the incident. After waiting thirteen days and spending much time trying to contact the other insurance company unsuccessfully and not having a car to drive, on 8/8 an adjuster finally came and looked at my car. They came to an estimate of around $1650 in damages. I called the insurance company today (8/11), however, and they said they wouldn't be able to send a check yet because they were looking into whether or not they are actually liable for the situation and I may not receive any money from them at all.

On top of this here are a few other points:

* I have not been given funds for a rental car, even though the letter they sent me says I should have been.

* I only have liability on my car since I am a 21 year old driving a 1996 Mercury Mystique and it's all I can afford so it likely wouldn't cover any of the damages. 

* I have had to borrow my girlfriends car to get to and from work or have her drop me off/pick me up for the past two weeks since I can't drive my car.

Is there anything I can do about this situation? Or am I just unlucky as shit?

The backstory: They were together close to 10 years, he was on-and-off physically abusive for 6 of them. They recently separated, her and I started casually seeing each other and it is beginning to develop into something with potential.

I am finding myself slightly concerned with the fact that she is maintaining contact with him, despite there being a strict no-contact order in place. While I will admit enjoying being with her, this concern is more for her well being than it is for mine. I have known her for several years and genuinely wish the best for her and having more than my fair share of experience in abusive relationships, I worry that she is on the road to being back with an abuser.

Now, were I not regularly impressed with her strength and resolve I would have gotten out as soon as she broke the no-contact, but so far I have put my trust in her judgement.

But lately she has said some concerning things. Talking about how his alcoholism and mental health problems were responsible for his behavior, and about the complete difference in mental-states. 

His physical abuse manifested in him going into a rage and beating or choking her while blacked out, then feeling awful about it the next day. However I have made note of a variety of tell-tale signs of classical psychological manipulation (asking her to lie on the stand, taking every conversational opportunity to say 'I love you' or 'I miss you' in an attempt to psychologically ground her to him.

I have let on slightly that I have a fair amount of understanding of abuse. What I have not stated is that I myself am a former, now reformed for many years, abuser. This is the position of experience I am speaking from. His behavior is exactly manipulative in a very familiar way, and the excuses she makes for him sound exactly like things people I have loved have said.

It is breaking my heart, but I also recognize that I don't have the full story and could very well be projecting onto the situation. I'm not sure whether to confront her about the full extent of my concerns, simply walk away to avoid heartbreak, or stick it out and hope she can withstand his manipulation.

Hello all! I am a 20 year old looking to get a new car. I am a student at a private university in California. Fortunately, I pay for school solely with federal loans and grants and also scholarships. Due to the fact that I do not have any private loans for school, I do not make loan payments yet. 

I have a decent credit score of 610 and currently am building my credit with two credit cards, one from Discover and one from Capital One. I keep up with my monthly payments and only have a balance of $290 total for both cards. Other than that, I pay my phone bill, which is $100 a month. 

I work at a good job that pays $18/hour and I also plan to get another job or two over the summer, which would bring my monthly income to at least $1,000. With this being said, does it sound like I am a candidate to finance a car? Also, how would I go about looking for a new car and what should I look for? I currently have a car but it is not in great shape, I can probably sell it for $3,000. 

I would appreciate any advice anyone has when looking for a new car, especially considering my situation. I would also like to make note that I am looking to get a normal, affordable car such as a Honda.

So, I need to give a little bit of a back story. My morning ritual after I wake up is to smoke a cigarette, take out my dogs, let the cats in, and feed the animals. 

Well, this morning, I was feeling a little frisky. I rolled over in bed and nudged my boyfriend to wake up. He got the hint after I was... should I say..*feeling him up*.

Well, we got in the mood, and I was instantly put into doggy. While face down, my puppy decided to jump on the bed in lick my face. ""GO AWAY LOLA"" we barked at her while my boyfriend pushed her out of the way. Now, we have a queen size bed, so she decided to go on the edge and whimper while we were going at it. 

She's whining and whining, all whilst telling her to shut up. ""She must just be hungry. This is about the time I feed her"" I suggested. Well, my boyfriend rolls me over into missionary and our puppy decided to come a little closer. Pushed her away again. Then we both smelled this distinguished smell along with a warmth all under and around us. THE LITTLE SHIT PISSED NEXT TO US WHILE WE WERE DOING IT!

FUCK! SHE NEEDED TO GO OUT! SHE WASNT WHINING BECAUSE SHE WAS HUNGRY! 

It was all over my legs and back, all over my boyfriends hands and legs. Hell, I think a little got on our poo tang and skin flute. 
I was so mad. We instantaneously threw her outside and proceeded to shower like we never showered before.

Some background: We were good friends during Sophomore year (high school) but that fell off as she started to date a friend of mine from church (now broken up after she followed him to college, she's still there for another year). Me and her haven't talked much since HS, but when I look back, I miss how meaningful and open our conversations were. I have yet to this day had such open talks about life with anyone due to the changing nature of college (people graduating, moving away, getting married, etc.). 

I saw my friend at Target at the start of the school year and started some small talk about how things were, etc. A few months later I decided to ask her to hang out - nothing serious. I asked her to hang out but nothing came of it. She said she wanted to but forgot and said she had meetings and work but would try to figure something out, but again forgot.

I'm not very good at social cues especially over fb and the like, but I do really miss talking to her and want to be at least friends again. I'm the kind of person who's afraid of making people uncomfortable and my relationships suffer for that (working on it). Is there anything I can do? I mean even if I push again, the worst she can do is say no and we never talk again which is what would happen if I did nothing, right? Just not sure how to go about it. 

Below is the poem I'm tempted to send her, not a love poem but a friend poem. I did like her more than that in hs and I feel like those feelings can come back, idk. If anyone simply replies: ""You've just got to let her go, there are other fish the in sea"", I get that, that's true, I've just been lonely and desperate for a real friend - it's hard to never talk about more than the coolest movie out now or school (small talk which is what everyone I know is interested in). 

I'm just seeing what options I have and looking for some reassurance in how to go about this.

Let me start this off by saying I'm pansexual, but I don't enjoy dating men. I enjoy sex with men, but my preference is always women, enough for me to call myself a lesbian most of the time so I don't have to deal with people being rude about my sexuality. aside from the first boyfriend I had in high school, I've never dated men. Only women. And I recently broke up with my girlfriend of two years and so my mental state is really into rebound sex right now.

here's the problem. the person I've become interested is one of my coworkers. we got along instantly and I find myself really attracted to him. this is kind of rare for me but not unheard of. my roommate also works with us, he's technically one of my supervisors, and a lot of my friends have the sneaking suspicion that he's in love with me or at least infatuated. I don't return the feelings in any capacity. he's my friend and roommate first and foremost. since we live and work together we see a lot of each other. 

we're moving into a tiny ass apartment soon, because our current landlord fucked us over and a tiny apartment is the best we could manage on such short notice. there's virtually no privacy. I don't want to kick my friend out for hours at a time just so I can have sex with one of our mutual friends, especially since its pretty apparent my roommate has feelings for me.

So I met a girl in one of my classes at the end of last semester (about 4 months ago) and we hit it off from the start as friends. 

Well, I developed a crush on her so after we got dinner one night in February, I asked if she would be interested in going on a real date. She told me that she wasn't interested in dating anyone romantically right now. She had gotten out of a 4 year relationship a month or so before, so I initially thought this was the reasoning. Now, I realize she was probably just trying to let me down easy.

Since I failed to take the hint, I've spent the last month and a half flirting and showing her what a good guy (not nice guy, TM) I am in hopes that she was interested in me but just not ready to date. 

I have since realized my mistake and that she was trying to let me down easy, which has got me to thinking. I'm done flirting, but I can only imagine how awkward it was for her as I attempted to flirt with her over the past month or so. Which brings me to my question, do I owe her an apology? Or is it better if I just cease flirting and go on being friends without a word said about it?

So two weeks ago, my boyfriend of four months came up to me and said that he needs to get his spending under control because it was getting out of hand. Were both in college. He does some entrepreneurial stuff on the side and makes a pretty good amount of money, but he has a bad habit of constantly spending it (eating out a lot, buying what he wants, etc). He said on average he probably spends 30-40 dollars a day. 

So two weeks ago he tells me that he's gonna try to spend no money for two weeks. Shakes my hand and says he's gonna try his best. 

So today was two weeks, we were hanging out and I said so today's marks two weeks, did you make it? He said he did spend money, but he drastically cut his spending. He said he spent under 20 bucks for the whole two weeks. I got mad and said then you failed and you lied to me when you said you wouldn't spend any money. He said that that's not fair, and that he went from spending 40 bucks a day to ten bucks a week. Now granted he makes really good money (he does a lot of design work on the side, sometimes more than 2K a month), I Still think he went back on his word and didn't try hard enough. I told him that I don't appreciate him making a promise to me and then doing it half ass. He noticed me genuinely getting upset and he told me I'm being ridiculous ""I can't believe youre mad"". 

I can easily go a month without spending anything. He should have cooked before hand instead of having to buy something last minute because he "" didn't have time to go back and cool something""

Ugh I just don't know. I hate shit like this. I'm Still upset with him and he's starting to get upset with me for ""being upset over nothing"" but I want him to apologize.  He doesn't think its warranted.

I've known this girl for about three months now and the only reason I haven't made her my girlfriend is because I knew she was moving two hours away but we've become really close and it's basically like we're dating now. She'll be moving really soon(but coming back in the fall) and we're considering a long distance relationship but we kind of always avoid talking about it since we're so unsure of what'll happen.

okay, lets go back in time to a few months ago, maybe like.. 6, if not more.

We started talking online around spring, we both live in different states so we got close talking on the phone/texting/skyping/etc. We met up recently and had really good time. What I don't understand is his intentions. 

He was very affectionate, and physical (kissing, sex, all that). It doesn't seem like he's only interested in FWB since he talks to me on the phone when we're apart, and I can't describe well, but the way he treats me. However, he says that he loves me but he doesn't want to date. 

His reasoning is that he just got out of long relationship recently, he likes to be ""free"" and not having to worry about a girl. Why should there be a label as ""bf/gf"", being committed, if we can just have a good time together?

What do you think he is thinking? Do you think he is just rebounding/going with the motion with me until he finds someone? I don't have to decide cut-clear dating/not dating, but I don't want to be too attached to later learn that he moved on to someone else.

I ended a 2 year relationship 5 months ago. I was in love, engaged, living together. She cheated multiple times before I got my shit together and left.

2 months after ending things with my ex, I met my girlfriend, Faith, and we started dating. She has a _ton_ going for her: Fit, smart, funny, good job, hard working, honest, lots of the same interests, high sex drive.

The problem is that I feel like lingering feelings for my ex have made me unable to ""attach"" to someone new. And maybe Faith doesn't have some of the outgoing personality traits of my ex that I liked, but she has a lot of other great qualities that I sometimes feel like I'm not valuing enough.

I'm trying to figure out if the lack of ""chemistry"" I feel is mostly because of not being over my ex, or if it's something else. Have any of you ever experienced this? Like something is broken with your emotions/heart and you're not open to really appreciating someone great? I don't want to screw this up and sometimes I feel flickers of understanding and realization that I'm being an idiot and not trying as hard as I should.

ok, so I've only ever kissed three guys in my life, and I've only been in one sort-of-relationship. That guy and I got along pretty well, we were seeing each other for a few months but I wanted us to be exclusive so we could have sex and he said no so we stopped hanging out after that. Anyways I haven't dated anybody since then, but I've recently met this guy I really like and I want to ask him out or something, but I keep thinking back to something the other guy said.

Basically, one night when we were cuddling and making out, he let slip that he could ""tell"" that I wasn't a very experienced kisser based on the way I kissed... when I got worried he tried to reassure me that it wasn't a bad thing, my kissing was just different somehow. At the time I was a little freaked out by that comment and got very self-conscious, so that almost every time we kissed after that I would wonder ""was this what he meant? was that what he meant?"" We broke up pretty soon after that anyway. 

So I really really don't want this new guy I like (or any guy) to think I'm inexperienced. I like to feel confident when I hook up with a guy, and if he thought I didn't know what I was doing I would feel awkward.

We've tried talking things out, taking a break, getting space and nothing has worked. Every little thing he does pisses me off. It's as if he's trying to make me hate him.

I told him a month ago that it made me uncomfortable when he makes sarcastic remarks about being single after he made a status that said something to the effect of ""Bring on the ladies!"". I deleted him as a friend after that, and we just never got around to adding each other again. So I remembered and brought it up and he added me.

I don't know if he forgot (unlikely), if he's doing this just to spite me, or if he just doesn't understand how much it hurts me. But even if he doesn't get it, shouldn't he still respect that it hurts me and stop doing it?

Now, we've been in situations like this before. He'll do something hurtful, I'll tell him, he'll think it's harmless. I've caught him hiding statuses from me before. He even deleted messages from a girl we almost had a threesome with. He said that he does this because ""he doesn't like my reactions"". He's trying to predict the way I'll respond to situations.

I'm posting from a throw away account...hopefully you guys (and gals) can help me out here.

I have been dating Danielle since August and things have been great so far.  Aside from one minor argument, things have gone pretty smoothly in our relationship with next to no arguing or disagreements.  She and I both go to college in Boston and are both 21.  Danielle and I both went to the same high school in Ohio before moving to Boston.

The other day I was having a chat with a friend of Danielle and I from high school.  Our friend asked if I was aware that Danielle had slept with Jake this past July.  Jake is one of my best buddies from high school who lived with me in Boston over the summer.  While Danielle and I weren't dating when this occurred, she clearly left Jake out of her ""history"" when we spoke about it a few months back.

I called Jake and asked him about sleeping with Danielle, and he confirmed that it happened.

I'm really not sure how to approach this, if at all, with Danielle.  I feel mislead, considering Jake is one of my best buddies, and that Danielle clearly avoided telling me about their hook up.  Danielle gets defensive when I bring up situations where she is ""in the wrong,"" and is often insecure about me talking to my friends who are girls.  On the other side of the coin, I'm pretty trusting when she wants to hang out or study with her guy friends.

For a little while now I've been struggling to myself about whether or not to end it with my gf. I thought it might be fixable but the fixable problems don't matter nearly as much as the ones that I don't think can be fixed. I know I want to break up with her, she thinks we're going to get married one day, have kids, move somewhere nice, the works. I don't see that happening anymore, so I need to end it. 

Her birthday is in two weeks and I promised her a daytrip. I don't want her to have a depressing birthday alone, she doesn't really seem to have a lot of friends and I know how bad she wants this daytrip, but I don't want her to look back thinking I was faking my way through it with her. I still enjoy being with her so I'm sure I could have a good time but it just feels dishonest.

The longer I wait the closer it gets to her birthday the harder it's going to be for me to do this, I don't wanna taint her birthday with a memory of a break up.

This happened around September. 

I have this Cartier money clip I bought from Japan for around 200 USD. I had left it on the dining table with all my stuff. 

We were having a get together and we decided to clear up the table with my stuff on it and my apartment mate was helping. 

When I was turned around putting stuff away my apartment mate tossed my money clip onto my roommate's desk where it hit a pot and dented the clip. 
He offered to pay for another one because he didn't know how much it cost but I was so mad that I just told him that it's too expensive. In my head at the time I thought that I didn't want to risk the friendship over money. 

I tried pretty hard to just write it off but that dent in the clip and his stupidity in throwing my clip was bothering me. 

Later on in the year in an unrelated incident, we're not on speaking terms and we're not friends anymore. He's decided to stop talking to me and has been a real bitch to me since then and I remembered about my clip. 

I wanted to get my clip repaired and ask him to pay for the repairs. 

Should I go along with this and how should I do it?

For reference, we are both bisexual but this is not the first woman I've dated.

I don't mind the fact that catcallers upset her, I know how horrible it can be to be shouted at. When dating a guy, a deal breaker for me is if a guy won't hold my hand because he hates the comments people shout out. Happened all the time, people (Usually drunk guys) would yell ""Look at the fags"" or whatever. Yes it can just ruin your night, but I made it a point that whoever I was with we both wouldn't let the douchebags ""win.""

But now my GF last month stopped wearing heels, because she says it encouraged the behavior and happened more when she wore heels. It bothered me a little, not because I care if she wore heels but she changed  her life around what these guys would do. I accepted it though, I told her what I thought, but I also like to choose my battles. 

However, now she has stopped wearing make-up for the same reason. She looks pretty without make-up, so I don't mind, but I do mind that shes changing her life based on what people yell while shes walking. I would never accept this from a boyfriend.

I just really wish she knew how to handle it better, but I don't know what exactly to say since I'm not a woman and don't know how other women handle it.

So I've been with my boyfriend for 3.5 years now and he doesn't care to spend his only holiday with me.

Our first Christmas together I bought us both tickets across the the country to visit his mom and step dad and we stayed with them for 10 days. The next year we both took off the ten days and I said we could do 5 days at my moms then 5 days at his moms (they only live 2 hours apart) and he said he really wanted to just spend time with his family since he only sees them once a year.  I only see my family once a year too though.  So he went to his moms for the full 10 days and I did 5 at both.

Last year I asked him again if he would do the 5 days at one then 5 days at the other and again no.  ""His family takes precedent"" because he only sees them once a year and he hasn't lived with her in 13 years.  So I said fine and I spent 10 days at my moms and he spent 10 days at his moms.  This year I didn't even bother to ask I'm just going home alone.  Also he hasn't asked me to come back to his families house since the first year I was there, although, I'm ""always welcome there"".

Besides all that he is a bar manager so he works every other holiday.  NYE, Valentines Day, Easter, July 4th, Halloween, and Thanksgiving which sucks in general but there's really not much he can do about those.

I get that people need space and freedom but I means it's the ONLY holiday he has free and I would like to spend it with him, but I don't want to take him away from family time either.

So I've been smoking for a couple years now and just went home to Michigan for Thanksgiving from college in Ohio. When I got back to my grandmas house in Ohio I was loading my uncles car to go back to campus when I realized I had left my backpack at home. This was a huge issue because I was keeping a few books, my laptop, and more importantly my stash and a few peices inside. So I tell my uncle I left my bag back home and, before I can text my brother to get the sensitive items out of my bag, my uncle calls my dad to double check I left it. My parents find it, search it and find everything inside.
Now my dad is threatening to stop paying my tuition and suggesting that I should enter rehab or some shit. This all could not have happened at a worse time as its finals week and this just adds a bunch of stress to my life. I go back home in about a week and thats when we're having our talk.

Trying to get my first job this summer, I have no experience working, I live in a town of about 2k people, I should have gotten a call for an interview by now. Had no luck getting a job this summer at ALL. I think I've applied at 6-8 places with no callbacks from any. I've applied at Walmart TWICE. I even asked my references If they've gotten calls asking about me, nope... WHY NOT? I've even talked to a few of the managers and they said they'd look at my app and then nothing... Nothing is wrong with my applications, phone numbers, etc everything is correct. The places I'm applying are hiring as well. I have no idea what's up. Do I really need to make a resume to work at a place like McDonald's or what? 
It's so frustrating not hearing back. What do I gotta do? Lie and say I'm living in my car and desperately need a job if I want to live?

Hey, /dogs! After seeing the post about Juno's admittedly awesome new coat, I became curious - at what point do coats become necessary for dogs? I know it varies from breed to breed based on fur layers/density, but is there some common guideline? 

I'm considering buying a coat for my Catahoula, but many people I know keep telling me it's silly (their reason being ""but he's a dog,"" so I take their advice with a grain of salt anyway.) I live in New Mexico, so it doesn't get below zero or anything, but we are very active outdoors and I fully intend on taking him up the mountain once some snow falls.

What should I do? More detail, or less detail? I want to impress them with a concise letter which invites them to seek more info from my resume, but I also want to highlight my qualities  and experiences which I think make me a perfect fit - and there are many things I could say to convince them of this!

My boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for about a year now. We are each other's best friends and this is our first relationship. He is nice, and accepts me for who I am as a person, despite my being a weirdo, and I reciprocate this. As of January, I've been wanting to stop wearing makeup out of personal convictions, and he seems to be upset by that. When I met him, I had really little self confidence, and I used makeup as a mask to look (apparently) beautiful. I was afraid of what he would think of ""the real me"". To me, makeup is a pretense, and I'm my ""real self"" without it. He argues by asking what the difference between makeup and styling my hair is (which I almost never do, either. I'm really into that natural look now, but I guess he isn't). Many people have told me that I'm beautiful, both men and women, with makeup and without makeup, but of course, I look much more ""dramatic"", ""older"", ""sexual"", and ""perfect"" with makeup. Without it, I look like a young, cute, innocent girl. I feel more confident in my appearance now (without makeup), and even freer, and often get complimented, but he seems to significantly prefer me with makeup. Should I be offended by this?

I've never had to deal with these issues before in a relationship. We've been dating for a little over 1 year now and everything has been great. We have not had any major issues nor is what I'm about to speak of major (yet). 

Problem #1: There is a strong possibility that I have HPV as I've had pustules in my pubic region recently clear up after 3 weeks of treatment from my doctor. At first she was very supportive and understood it was somewhat common, but now she is apprehensive to have sex. She has had the HPV vaccine for women that guards against certain strains of the virus and her tests come back as negative for any HPV I could have given her thus far. 

Problem #2: She is a young professional who is starting to get promoted/make more money,etc. where as I am returning to complete my Master's. This decision will make me much more busy and have much less money. I feel she is nervous that we're at different stages in our lives and that she wants to travel and be close with someone on a similar schedule, but obviously I can't provide either of these for the next 2+ years and this worries me.

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks guys!

I have a decent job with potentially great benefits, should I leave it and go to school for free with everything (books, supplies, and cost of living paid for?
Job eventually will match your 401k up to 7% and every year gives you 10% annual salary straight into 401k. So basically you make 30k or so cash money, but retirement accrues about 5100 every year for nothing. Of course with raises it will increase every year. But there is a ceiling of about 60k. (10,200) into 401k every year. 

The company will also pay 90% tuition once you are eligible for these benefits. Which would eliminate the ceiling or at least raise it to about 100k/year. No cost of living allowance, but I will be working so I wouldn't need it. 

Or would you quit and take a free ride to any university, also getting cost of living allowance in order to pay bills. A full blown free ride. 

I'm leaning toward school, I am 25, not too old to do it. Not too young too piss away an oppurtunity because freedom and alcohol is not new to me (something I would have done if I went in at 17-18). 

Only problem is my boss really likes me and I feel I will advance pretty quickly here. The company is a fortune 500 company. So it would feel pretty shitty if I left there and it were to not work out somehow.

So I guess some background info might be in order. I dated this girl for a year and seven months long distance and we broke up a week before I moved to a local university twenty minutes away from her in early September. The break up was a pretty rough and I've only talked to her once since I've moved. Anyways, the main problem I'm having arises from attempting to get a substantial amount of clothes back from her. I've asked a few close friends of hers that I'm pretty close with to take care of the exchange for me since the break up happened. The first friend, K, asked her a few days after the break up to bring the clothes over whenever she could. From what K informed me she gave him a day that she could and blew him off and hasn't talked to him since. Since then I've asked another friend, S, to do the same thing hoping that the out come would be different since they are in the same class and after school activity. Same result sadly. I'm wondering what would be the best of course of action in order to hopefully get my items back. I'm a few hundred miles away from my family members and money's pretty right now that I'm attending school, and with winter approaching fast I kind of need the clothes that she has in her possession. I was thinking about texting her mom(F40-50's) and asking for her help since we were on extremely good terms when I was dating her daughter. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

So this happened less than half an hour ago. Although I have had a root canal done more than 5 years ago, and being deathly afraid of dentists did not make it any pleasant.

So fast forward to present day. We are having a small office party of sorts, with cake and snacks and the likes. I am standing around with a bunch of my colleagues, enjoying the yummy chocolate cake and free snacks. 

I'm upto the last bite of cake and I hear a cringeworthy crunch inside my mouth and without thinking about it it spit  the half eaten cake out of my mouth. I see a white solid mass. At first I think ""Ooh white chocolate"" , and then I touch it and it feels very tooth like. Again without thinking about it I yell... ""OMG there's a tooth in the cake!!!"" My teammate next to me stops her spoon midway and just looks disgusted, so do all of the others including the director. For a minute or so I think ""I'm gonna sue!!""

Then I make a big mistake and turn it around and see that some cake is stuffed inside the tooth. My incredibly slow mind thinks,""hmmm .. weird, the tooth is hollow"". And it dawns on me slower than I am proud of, just when other colleague yells, ""Ewww it's your tooth"". Needless to say laughter ensues, and I am standing there still not believing that i just chewed my root canal crown off with a piece of chocolate cake. Not hard candy, not sugarcane, not an apple, but a piece of really yummy and moist CHOCOLATE CAKE.  

Obviously I can't just run away so I stand there just trying to shift focus to something else, but people just carry on laughing , whispering. I excuse myself finally and go to the restroom wash the cake filled cap and my mouth and come back to my desk, wishing I was invisible. 

Of course the first thing I think is, ""Hey let more people on reddit laugh at me""

Dear Mom and Dad,

Seriously? Just relax. You're driving me away from you and I am starting to not feel guilty about resenting either of you. You interrogate me over nearly everything, which you really shouldn't. I'm a good kid. I have a good head on my shoulders. I don't do anything stupid. You talk down to me and treat me like I'm an idiot or a five year old (not comparing the two) rather than a 22 year old. Newsflash: I'm intelligent and can make intelligent decisions. I have two degrees and I'm about to go off to grad school to get a third degree. Sure, I don't know everything at this age but you haven't had any problems with me prior to 22. Why start now? Yeah, I know I'll be moving away to grad school but let's be smart about this: treating me like this is not a good way to send me off without me resenting you. And it would be nice for you to show me some appreciation because you didn't have to pay for any of my undergrad because I worked hard to get a full ride. That was nice, don't you think? And I worked hard to get grad school paid for, so you're not paying for anything when I move down to start my studies. I've shown gratitude continuously throughout my life but now, I might seem like I'm less grateful but that is only because you're pushing me away. Please stop overreacting and controlling me. If you want me to come visit from grad school, or if you want me to invite you to my place, then it would probably be in your best interest to stop pushing me away. I will always love the two of you but I have no problem at all desensitizing and disconnecting myself from you. It's honestly not a problem. I've done it to others before and I can do it again. I'm sure there is more but why don't we work on one thing at a time.

We've been friends since we started working together 5 months ago. Her ex was mad about her staying out too late one night (with her female friends, not me) and decided to rough her up. Luckily they had just taken on a new roommate [26 M] who broke it up before it got too bad and took her to the police. The ex was arrested later that night.

Hi Reddit, 

Long time lurker here but first time poster. Writing this on my phone so apologies for any errors or funky formatting. 

Ill keep it short. Dating for 3 years, living together for 2. Both work full time. I do the overwhelming majority if housework and its starting to wear on my nerves. I cook 5 out of the 7 days a week (breakfast and dinner), we usually grab takeout on weekends. I do all the cleaning and laundry, grocery shopping, take the trash out, etc.  Ive asked for help but i usually have to ask multiple times otherwise he forgets and it doesnt get done. Most week nights he plays videos games while i make dinner and then sometimes he'll stop and we'll eat together or he'll just keep playing. He never offers to help cook or clean up after, although he will sometimes take the dishes from the bedroom to the kitchen.
 

I knew he was this way before we moved in together so maybe im guilty of wanting him to change but its really becoming an issue for me. I assumed it would be natural for both of us to help around the house but im finding that thats not true. We've talked about kids and i cant imagine the stress ill feel if im doing all the same things AND we have a baby.

Ive talked to him about my concerns several times and he usually apologizes and says he just doesnt know how to help.  But i get the feeling he doesnt think its a big deal. 

What should i do? Is this a big deal or am i just blowing things out of proportion?

In college I worked at a restaurant where I was injured, long story short I ended up in the emergency room with 11 stitches and was out of work for 3 days. My boss at the time gave me some paperwork to fill out and said he would fill in the rest then send it in. Being 19 and stupid I trusted that he would send the paper work into workers comp. Well he didn't. I didn't know that I had to file a claim on my own as well. I should have known better but again, I was young and stupid. 

So the account went into collections, but I didn't know because I moved a few months later. They didn't have my new address so I never got the letters saying that the account was in collections or that it needed attention. 

When I went to buy a car a year and a half ago I saw the account on my credit report ( I use credit karma). I contacted workers comp and they told me to file the claim now. I did all the paperwork they sent me and sent certified letters to my old boss. The thing is though that the restaurant has since gone out of business, but 2 months later the account came off of my report. I figured this meant that everything was sorted out and that he was now responsible for the debt. Today I looked at my credit karma account and the account is back on there.

Question up front: I'm looking for words of wisdom or perspective altering advice for dealing with a girlfriends past. 

Story time: My girlfriend of 5 months and I were getting ready for bed last night and we start talking about her ex-husband, which I knew about. Nothing really new of note there, but we somehow got started on the topic of what happened after the marriage ended and what happened before I came into the picture relationship wise. Bad idea, but my curiosity got the better of me at that moment in time. 

Nothing really threw me off, some randoms here and there, except from January-April of this year she was fuck-buddies with this doctor in his 40s. Stories about him taking her on trips to exotic lands followed, that unsettling feeling where you're trying to hide your anguish and not knowing if you're doing a good job soon followed. 

Now, I'm sure that's standard fare for a decent number people about to hit 30 to have that sort of past at some point in their life story, but it has me totally mind fucked, how could I live up to that? 

Am I comparing myself to those that have come before me to the extreme? After falling asleep with it on my mind and thinking about it throughout the day.

Also I would like to point out I've been to multiple universities and around 80ish dermatologists since I was about 6 (when I first started bleeding profusely and we didn't know what it was) and testing places to find a cure and nothing has worked other then the confirmation from most of the doctors that it won't go away. So ...Yeah do I still have a chance?
","Cystic acne causing blood everywhere since 6, no cure, is it possible I can find someone who will find me attractive?""Should I allow my father to watch my 16 month old for 5-7 days?
Hey guys, so my wife and I are going to Florida for a week to visit family.  My dad and her mother both live down there so it will be a nice trip to visit the grandparents.  At the end of the trip my father asked if he can keep my son for 5-7 days, I said no problem, it would be nice to have a break.  My wife however is fighting me and coming up with all these reasons why he shouldn't.

A little background on my dad, he brought up 3 boys (including me) and we were NOT easy kids to deal with.  My son is a very strong willed 16-month-old and can throw a tantrum at almost anything and also does not sleep very well.  She's afraid my dad won't be able to handle this and also afraid that it is too long away from her (my kid is very attached to his mother.)   

She thinks this is far too long and also at the end of the trip, my dad plans on driving up to us in New Jersey (21 hour drive) to drop my son off and stay for a few weeks.  The drive is also a major concern of hers, but my dad will be with his girlfriend and they have both taken care of my son before.  

Am I being too relaxed about this?  Is my wife being too strict about this?  I think it will be good for my child to be away from mom for a bit since he is overly attached.  I also think my dad deserves time with his grandson who he adores.  Please any advice would be helpful!

Throwaway account. I got a call last night at around 8:30 from a person claiming to be a representative from my bank. She asked if I had received the new credit card that they had sent a notification about a few months ago. I recently moved out of my parents' house and occasionally still receive mail at that address and I did remember seeing some kind of letter from my bank about a new card but it kind of slipped my mind. This was probably early November. I try to avoid using my credit card regularly but I've probably used it a few times since getting this letter but I've paid it off pretty fast each time. 

She said that because I have such great credit they were upgrading my service. I asked what kind of services this new card would give me and she was kind of vague but directed me to a website with information. Honestly, I can't remember the name of the website. She confirmed my parents' address and said a new card would be coming in the mail.

I checked all of my accounts this morning and there are no odd charges on either my debit card or my credit card. There's no new card activated. I'm thinking I'll probably call my bank on my lunch break just to double check. I'm just not sure if I'm still somehow being scammed. She didn't ask any pressing information from me; could I still be getting ripped off?

Hey y'all.

I know this sounds really crazy, but let me preface~

I've been seeing this guy D for 4ish months now.

We actually met on Tinder (lol) and hit it off right away.

Neither of us were really looking for anything serious, I had just left a cheating ex a few months before and his divorce from a cheating ex had just become finalized a few months prior.
**Note: He had been separated over a year before said divorce was finalized.**

Things have been going well and I really like him/see it potentially becoming more serious in the future. For now we're exclusive and I simply enjoy his presence.

A month or two ago he mentioned wanting to pick up and move to the West Coast (we're currently in the Midwest) and jokingly asked if I wanted to come.

I laughed it off in the moment but lately I've seriously been considering it.
Since graduating school I haven't been able to find a job in my field and have been slumming it in retail, I'm not super close with my family, and all of my closest friends have actually relocated to different states as well, so I don't have much keeping me here.

Tbh I've been wanting to get outta Dodge for a while now...so it's kinda like why not?

Prespective moving date would be late October, early November soo in 7ish months.
I'm aware a lot can happen in that time frame but I figure I should start saving now and go from there...

Hypothetically if said move did happen, and he and I didn't work out, I would either stay if I loved it or come back here.
Trying to be as realistic as possible.

Any thoughts guys?
I haven't mentioned it to friends or family yet because I'm wondering if it really does sound ill conceived...
","Considering relocating with a guy I haven't been dating all that long in 6-7 months time. Have been wanting to move regardless, would have plan if we didn't work out. Crazy?""American Redditors - Are Science and Christianity mutually exclusive? And does not being Christian mean you preach Atheism?
Let me explain, and I'm not getting on my high-horse...

In Australia, I always went to Christian schools, where they also taught science and evolution. Australians don't promote ""Yeah, Science!"" in the same way, because 'Creationism' is almost non-existent here.

Christian teachings never sat well with me, and for years I considered myself Atheist, until I learned that there's a difference between spirituality and religion. I've since studied all kinds of spiritual teachings, but don't label myself as anything, because I don't care to.

Some of the r/atheism posts are just as irritating as any religious rant because it's preaching Atheism in the same way.

So, can't science just exist without being anti-Christian, and can't you be non-religious without pushing atheism, and just make more cat posts?
","Christianity doesn't need to compete with Science. Non-religious people can still be spiritual, without the label. Less atheism, more cats."
