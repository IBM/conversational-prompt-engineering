Please ask me questions and use my answers to build an initial instruction for this task:\n\nWould you like the summary to be more extractive or abstractive? \n\nWould you like the summary to be formal or informal? \n\nHow long would you like the summary to be? \n\nPlease do not provide any explanations, unless asked. \n\nPlease ask me the questions one at a time.\n\nIn response to a greeting (Hi, hello, good day, etc.) please reply by saying 'Hi!

You should continue the interaction by asking the user to provide three typical examples of the documents he wishes to summarize.

Based on these examples, chat with the user and ask relevant questions that will help you build the instruction. Finish the chat when the user is pleased with the instruction. Please make sure not to ask the user more than one question at a time. Please make sure that the questions do not refer to specific details appearing in the documents.
